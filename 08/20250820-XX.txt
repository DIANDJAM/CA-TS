PATIENCE. AS YOU KNOW, I'M

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.902

HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:56.540
HONORED TO HELP LEAD THIS ALONG.

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.409
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF

00:42:58.475 --> 00:43:01.211
YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND THAT

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:03.514
WE ALL KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.316
THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:06.283
CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.385
WELCOME TO OUR FIRST HEARING OF

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:09.687
THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:11.322
SELECT COMMITTEE ON CHILD CARE

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:13.557
COSTS. WE ARE EXCITED TO

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.392
WELCOME ALL OF YOU HERE TO

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.528
DISCUSS THIS. THE STATE OF OUR

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:19.630
CHILD CARE SYSTEM. THE ROLE OF

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:21.498
THIS COMMITTEE IS TO EXAMINE

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:23.801
THE CURRENT STATE OF CHILD CARE

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:25.469
AND FIND SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:27.604
ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. CHILD

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:30.441
CARE IS A CRITICAL SUPPORT FOR

00:43:30.507 --> 00:43:31.508
WORKING FAMILIES AND FOR OUR

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:33.377
ECONOMY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.412
IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:37.247
ALLOWS PARENTS TO WORK WHILE

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:39.850
THEIR CHILDREN ARE IN A SAFE

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:41.652
LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. BUT TODAY,

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:43.921
CHILD CARE IS AN UNAFFORDABLE

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:46.623
FOR EVEN OR EVEN UNAVAILABLE TO

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.525
MANY FAMILIES. FOR MARRIED

00:43:48.592 --> 00:43:50.894
COUPLE EARNING THE MEDIAN

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:53.364
INCOME OF 138,000, INFANT CHILD

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.699
CARE TAKES UP 16% OF THEIR

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.502
INCOME. AND FOR A SINGLE PARENT

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:01.271
EARNING THE MEDIAN INCOME OF

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:04.541
$45,000, INFANT CARE TAKES A.

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:06.877
IT TAKES A FULL HALF OF THEIR

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:08.445
INCOME. FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.514
WITH THE HIGH COSTS OF RAISING

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.816
CHILDREN. CALIFORNIA'S BIRTH

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:15.386
RATE HAS ALREADY DROPPED 28% IN

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:18.222
THE LAST 20 YEARS, AND IS

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:20.924
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE.

00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:23.093
PARENTS PNOT AFFORD

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.462
MORE, AND PROVIDERS CANNOT

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:26.764
AFFORD TO STAY WHEN THEIR WAGES

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.767
ARE SO LOW. WITHOUT PUBLIC

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:32.169
INTERVENTION, THE SYSTEM WILL

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:33.404
CONTINUE TO FAIL. FAMILIES AND

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.340
PROVIDERS ALIKE. OVER THE PAST

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:38.509
DECADE, THE STATE HAS WORKED TO

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:39.743
EXPAND ACCESS TO CHILD CARE AND

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.378
IMPROVE PAY FOR PROVIDERS. MUCH

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:44.148
OF THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN

00:44:44.214 --> 00:44:45.382
SUPPORTED BY THE PANDEMIC

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:47.384
RELIEF FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:48.886
GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAVE NOW RUN

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:51.321
OUT. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A LONG

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:52.689
TERM STRATEGY TO STABILIZE OUR

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:55.692
CHILD CARE SYSTEM AND LIFT UP

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:58.295
WORKING FAMILIES. TODAY, WE

00:44:58.362 --> 00:44:59.229
WILL HEAR DIRECTLY FROM

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:01.532
FAMILIES, PROVIDERS AND EXPERTS

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:02.900
ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AND

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:04.168
THEIR IDEAS FOR STRENGTHENING

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:05.803
THE SYSTEM. BEFORE I GET

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:07.271
STARTED, I WILL PROVIDE AN

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:09.373
OVERVIEW OF THE RULES FOR

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.707

HEARING. AS WE BEGIN TESTIMONY

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:15.646
AND PUBLIC COMMENT, I WANT TO

00:45:15.712 --> 00:45:16.780
REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:18.315

AND FAIR. THESE RULES APPLY

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.687
EQUALLY TO ALL PARTICIPANTS,

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:24.788
REGARDLESS OF VIEWPOINTS. THEY

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:26.490
ARE MEANT TO PROTECT EVERYONE'S

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.425
RIGHTS AND ENSURE EFFECTIVE

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:29.693

WE WILL NOT PERMIT TALKING OR

LOUD NOISES FROM THE AUDIENCE.

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:36.100
I KNOW IT'S HARD NOT TO CLAP,

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.701
BUT HOLD BACK. PUBLIC COMMENT

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:39.703

ASSEMBLY MEMBER NGUYEN AS

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.475

TO THE SUBJECT OF TODAY'S

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:49.680
HEARING. DISRUPTIVE OR

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:50.848
THREATENING BEHAVIOR WILL NOT

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.549
BE TOLERATED. AFTER YOUR

VIOLATIONS OF THESE RULES MAY

00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.756
RESULT IN REMOVAL OR OTHER

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:02.226
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. WE THANK

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:03.994
YOUR COOPERATION AND

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:07.397
PARTICIPATION. BEFORE WE MOVE

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.533
ON, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.934
ASSEMBLY MEMBER NGUYEN. NGUYEN

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:12.870
WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW THINGS,

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:15.239
AND I'LL OFFER THE SAME TO YOU.

00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:18.642
THANK YOU. REALLY EXCITED TO BE

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:22.412
A PART OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE.

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:24.681
WHEN I WAS ASKED TO CO-CHAIR,

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:26.416
IT WAS AN AUTOMATIC YES. AS A

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:30.454
MOTHER TO TWO GIRLS, I KNOW

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.256
THAT WHEN I SHARE MY CONCERNS,

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:34.424
WHEN I, YOU KNOW, THOUGHT ABOUT

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:35.559
GETTING PREGNANT AND HAVING

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:36.727
KIDS, IT WAS, WHO'S GOING TO

00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:38.829
TAKE CARE OF MY KID? I HAVE TO

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:40.631
WORK. AND MANY OF US GO THROUGH

00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:42.199
THAT RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S

00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:43.467
PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:46.036
TOPIC OF WHETHER OR NOT FOLKS

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:47.237
DECIDE WHETHER THEY SHOULD

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:49.573
START A FAMILY OR NOT, BECAUSE

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.774
YOU CAN'T AFFORD CHILD CARE

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:53.377
THESE DAYS. AS A MATTER OF FACT,

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:54.545
HERE IN CALIFORNIA, WE'RE

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.146
RANKED FOURTH AS THE HIGHEST IN

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:59.616
CHILD CARE. MANY OF US PAY AS

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:02.452
MUCH AS WHAT OUR MORTGAGE, IF

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.922
NOT EVEN MORE, TO PROVIDE CHILD

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.423
CARE FOR OUR KIDS. AND SO WE

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.259
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WE HAVE

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:10.661
TO DO SOMETHING TO ENSURE THAT

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:13.597
NOT ONLY WE LEAD THE WAY, BUT

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:16.433
THAT THERE'S A FUTURE FOR OUR

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.235
KIDS AS WELL TOO. AND SO I'M

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:20.537
REALLY EXCITED TO BE A PART OF

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:22.339
THIS SELECT COMMITTEE. LOOKING

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:24.575
FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:25.842
AND WHAT'S BEING SHARED, WHAT'S

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.644
GOING TO BE SHARED TODAY WITH

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:29.546
THE DIFFERENT PANELS AND THOSE

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:32.249
THAT ARE EXPERTS IN THIS. AND

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:34.484
THE HOPE IS THAT WE WALK AWAY

00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:37.020
FROM HERE WITH A SOLID PLAN, A

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:39.890
SOLID PLAN THAT'S GOING TO

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:42.426
ALLOW US TO NOT ONLY EVER

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:43.694
QUESTION THE FACT WHETHER OR

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.362
NOT WE CAN AFFORD TO HAVE KIDS,

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.898
BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT IS GOING

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:48.732
TO DEPEND ON CHILD CARE,

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:50.334
WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD GO TO

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.536
WORK OR STAY AT HOME AND TAKE

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:54.438
CARE OF OUR KIDS, OR WHETHER OR

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:57.641
NOT THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE

00:47:57.708 --> 00:48:00.310
NEED TO INVEST MORE IN. RIGHT?

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:02.879
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AT THE

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:04.081
BELIEF THAT THIS IS AN AREA

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:05.449
THAT WE NEED TO ABSOLUTELY

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:07.684
INVEST MORE MONEY IN, BECAUSE

00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:09.453
THIS IS OUR FUTURE. AND SO I

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:11.655
WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:14.591
HERE. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR,

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.793
FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE A PART OF

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.563
THIS WITH YOU. SO WOULD YOU

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.399
LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING? I JUST

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:23.634
WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.636
HAVING ME. I'M ALSO HONORED TO

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:26.503
BE ON THIS COMMITTEE. I

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.438
REPRESENT A VERY RURAL DISTRICT

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:29.573
OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, FROM

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.374

ALPINE AND AMADOR COUNTIES, 11

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.611
COUNTIES IN ALL. AND CHILD CARE

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:36.780
IS A CONSTANT CRISIS FOR US IN

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:37.914
RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO VERY

00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:40.417
EAGER TO LEARN AND SEE WHAT WE

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:42.519
CAN DO TO HELP AND MAKE SURE WE

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:43.820
ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION. SO

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.255
THANK YOU. GREAT. THANK YOU

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:47.524

COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:43.246
CHUNG. I'M A LEADER WITH PAN

00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:44.581
VOICES. I'M HERE TODAY WITH MY

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:48.785
DAUGHTER. WE LIVE TOGETHER WITH

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:50.887
HER DAD IN SAN FRANCISCO. I'M

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:54.091
HERE TODAY TO SHARE WHAT MY

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:57.361
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIKE. I'M

00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.529
HERE TODAY TO SHARE WHAT MY

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:00.297
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIKE

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.332
WITHOUT HAVING CHILD CARE.

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:04.901
PEOPLE THINK THAT SAN FRANCISCO

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.503
MAKE IT SO EASY, BUT THE TRUTH

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.840
IS, IT IS NOT. IT'S HARD HERE

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:12.676
TO ABOUT. I WANT TO SHARE WITH

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:16.380
YOU A STORY ABOUT 14 YEARS AGO,

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:19.282
WHEN MY SISTER WAS A BABY. SO

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.551
MY MOM LEFT HER WITH A

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:23.920
BABYSITTER SO THAT SHE COULD GO

00:50:23.987 --> 00:50:25.522
TO WORK. LATER THAT DAY, WHEN

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:28.759
SHE CAME TO PICK HER UP, SHE

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:31.194
HAD SEIZURES, LIKE EPISODES OF

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:32.496
SEIZURES. IT'S NOT JUST ONE

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:34.631
TIME, IT'S LIKE EPISODES OF IT.

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:37.300
SHE HAD, LIKE VOMITING. SHE

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:40.604
COULDN'T KEEP FOOD DOWN. THEY

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.406
TOOK HER TO THE HOSPITAL, THEY

00:50:42.472 --> 00:50:44.541
TOOK AN MRI, AND THEY FOUND OUT

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:50.580
THAT SHE HAD A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE.

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.983
THEY GAVE HER IN THE HOSPITAL

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:55.719
FOR THREE WEEKS TO TREAT HER,

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:59.589
AND CPS GOT INVOLVED. CPS

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:02.592
REMOVED HER FROM MY MOM CARE

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:05.362
AND PLACED HER IN FOSTER CARE,

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:07.631
AND IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO, YOU

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:10.066
KNOW, TO TO HAVE HER BACK TO BE

00:51:10.133 --> 00:51:14.337
HER LEGAL GUARDIAN. THANK GOD

00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:16.506
MY SISTER ENDED UP BEING OKAY,

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.574
BUT IT WAS REALLY TRAUMATIZING

00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:20.710
FOR MY FAMILY. I STILL LIVE

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.546
WITH THAT TRAUMA, YOU KNOW,

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:24.681
UNTIL THIS DAY. I DON'T WANT

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.550
THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO MY

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:30.654
DAUGHTER. SO FOR ME, MY IDEAL

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.491
CHILD CARE PROVIDER WOULD BE A

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:37.394
FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMEONE I KNOW

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:40.964
PERSONALLY OR TRUST. I NEED TO

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:42.499
MAKE SURE MY DAUGHTER IS IN A

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:45.502
SAFE ENVIRONMENT. I APPLY FOR

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:46.770
FAMILY, FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:48.705
CARE IN SAN FRANCISCO, BUT IT'S

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:51.575
A LONG WAITING LIST. I DON'T

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.343
KNOW WHEN I'LL BE ABLE TO COME

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:56.980
OFF OF IT. IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:58.648
THAT YOU KNOW, THIS TYPE OF

00:51:58.715 --> 00:51:59.683
CHILD CARE IS CONSIDERED WORSE

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:02.219
BY SO MANY PEOPLE. IF YOU'RE

00:52:02.285 --> 00:52:05.922
WEALTHY, IT'S OKAY TO LEAVE THE

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:09.426
KIDS WITH A NANNY. BUT WITH

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:12.629
PEOPLE LIKE US, YOU KNOW,

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:14.564
WITHOUT A LOT OF MONEY, WE

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.466
DON'T GET TO CHOOSE THE CARE WE

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:20.237
FEEL IS BEST FOR OUR KIDS. I DO

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.905
ENJOY THE TIME I GET TO SPEND

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:23.573
WITH MY DAUGHTER, AND I'M

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.408
GRATEFUL FOR THE MEMORIES THAT

00:52:25.475 --> 00:52:28.678
WE MADE SINCE SHE WAS BORN. MY

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:30.447
DAUGHTER LOVES TO COOK, SO, YOU

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:33.216
KNOW, I WE DO COOKING CLASSES

00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:35.852
TOGETHER. WE GO TO THE

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:37.787
BOTANICAL GARDEN, WE PLAY IN

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:39.956
THE MUD KITCHENS. SHE LIKES TO

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:43.660
GET HER HANDS DIRTY. WE WE

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:45.462
FIGHT CATERPILLARS AND WE RAISE

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:49.833
THEM AND AND RAISE THEM IN OUR

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:50.534
HOME. WE JUST RELEASED SOME

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.368
BUTTERFLIES. AFTER WATCHING

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:53.470
THEM GO INTO COCOONS. I REALLY

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:56.106
DO CHERISH THESE MEMORIES WITH

00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:57.541
MY DAUGHTER, BUT AT THE SAME

00:52:57.607 --> 00:53:01.578
TIME, IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:04.581
FINANCIALLY. I WAS A NURSE

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:06.383
BEFORE MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN,

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:08.552
AND I THOUGHT I WOULD AT LEAST

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.520
HAVE THE OPTION TO GO BACK TO

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:13.557
WORK, BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:15.458
IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE I

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:18.261
LAST WORK. IT'S HARD TO SURVIVE

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:20.997
ON JUST ONE INCOME IN SAN

00:53:21.064 --> 00:53:23.600
FRANCISCO. MY FAMILY HAS LOST

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:25.368
OUT ON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:28.171
DOLLARS THAT I COULD HAVE MADE

00:53:28.238 --> 00:53:28.772
BY WORKING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:32.242
HAVE CHILDCARE. I ALSO WORRY

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:34.511
ABOUT GETTING A JOB BECAUSE WHO

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:37.547
WOULD HIRE ME AFTER SO MANY

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:39.549
YEARS OUT OF PRACTICE? I FEEL

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:42.953
LIKE I LOST MY NURSING SKILLS

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:44.788
AND I. I JUST CANNOT PICK UP

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:47.457
WHERE I LEFT OFF. IN SOME WAYS,

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:48.692
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE TO START

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.727
MY CAREER OVER AGAIN JUST

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:54.297
BECAUSE I HAD A CHILD. THESE

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:56.399
FIRST FIVE YEARS ARE SO

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.234
CRITICAL IN A CHILD LIFE.

00:53:58.301 --> 00:54:00.503
AROUND 90% OF A CHILD BRAIN

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.106
DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS BY THE AGE

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:06.476
OF FIVE. SO LIKE I SAID, I LOVE

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:07.777
BEING ABLE TO BE THERE WITH MY

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:10.480
DAUGHTER. BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:12.282
FRUSTRATING TO NOT HAVE

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:14.584
CHILDCARE. I HOPE THAT THIS

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:16.853
COMMITTEE REALLY BRINGS SOME

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.487
SOLUTION FOR CHILDCARE

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:18.555
AFFORDABILITY FOR FAMILIES LIKE

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:21.725
MY. THERE ARE THOUSANDS, IF NOT

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.426
MILLIONS OF FAMILIES THAT NOW

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:24.761
STAY WITH A SIMILAR STORY ABOUT

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:26.963
NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.764
CHILDCARE AND SACRIFICING THEIR

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:31.835
CAREERS TO MAKE IT WORK. WE

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:32.669
DESERVE TO HAVE A CHILDCARE

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:34.871
SYSTEM THAT INVESTS IN US AND

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.506
OUR KIDS, THAT ALLOW US TO

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:37.807
CHOOSE THE CHILDCARE THAT WE

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:39.709
KNOW IS RIGHT FOR OUR FAMILIES

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.611
AND THAT PAYS OUR CHILDCARE

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:43.546
PROVIDERS WHAT THEY DESERVE.

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:46.383
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:49.352
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:51.655
AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS ANITA

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.690
VIZZINI AND I AM A LARGE

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:54.958
LICENSED CHILD CARE PROVIDER

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:57.227
OUT OF TUOLUMNE COUNTY. SO A

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:59.729
RURAL COUNTY. I'M A VERY PROUD

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.798
MEMBER OF CPU AND THE

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:02.499
BARGAINING TEAM. THROUGHOUT

00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:04.534
BARGAINING, WE CONTINUE TO TALK

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.870
ABOUT THE TRUE COST OF CARE,

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:07.904
THE ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY.

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:10.373
BUT I WANT TO OPEN YOUR GUYS'S

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.375
EYES, LIKE REALLY OPEN YOUR

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:13.977
EYES TO WHAT THAT MEANS FOR

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:15.378
PROVIDERS. I WOULD LIKE TO I

00:55:15.445 --> 00:55:17.480
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE JUST A FEW

00:55:17.547 --> 00:55:18.715
MINUTES OF YOUR TIME AND GIVE

00:55:18.782 --> 00:55:20.383
YOU A BREAKDOWN OF MY ACTUAL

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.452
COST OF CARE, HOW LITTLE I GET

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:25.321
PAID, AND HOW I MANAGE TO GAP

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:27.857
BETWEEN THE TWO DURING THE

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:29.292
SUMMER MONTHS. I HAVE 14

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:31.394
CHILDREN IN CARE. HOLY SNOT.

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:34.431
RIGHT? 14 KIDS IN CARE THAT USE

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:36.466
STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. ONCE

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:38.401
SCHOOL STARTS BACK UP, WHICH

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:40.870
FOR OUR COUNTY IT STARTED BACK

00:55:40.937 --> 00:55:42.605
YESTERDAY. I LOSE TWO OF THOSE

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:44.974
KIDS COMPLETELY AND THREE WILL

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:47.077
BECOME AFTER SCHOOL KIDS ONLY,

00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:49.446
WHICH WILL LOWER MY MONTHLY MY

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:51.247
MONTHLY INCOME DRASTICALLY.

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:53.950
AFTER SCHOOL CARE IS CONSIDERED

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.585
PART TIME CARE AND THE RATES

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:59.155
ARE MINIMAL. I WILL LOSE

00:55:59.222 --> 00:56:02.425
$791.82 PER FULL TIME CHILD

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:04.194
THAT IS ENTERING THE UPK SYSTEM,

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.629
AND WILL NOT BE ATTENDING MY

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:08.665
CHILD CARE AFTER SCHOOL, AND I

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:12.869
WILL LOSE ANOTHER $155.26 A

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.571
MONTH PER SCHOOL AGE CHILD THAT

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:17.273
WILL BE ATTENDING CHILD CARE AS

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.776
THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM.

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:24.481
THAT TOTAL IS $2,049.42 A MONTH

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.182
THAT I WILL BE LOSING STARTING

00:56:26.249 --> 00:56:28.618
SEPTEMBER. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:31.287
TO BREAK IT DOWN. I'M GOING TO

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.757
GET REAL. I'M GOING TO GET REAL,

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:34.758
REAL AND TELL YOU GUYS EXACTLY

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:36.426
WHAT MY COSTS ARE EVERY MONTH

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:37.594
AND EXACTLY WHAT I MADE OVER

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.330
THE SUMMER MONTHS. SO THIS

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:41.531
MONTH, I RECEIVED PAYMENT FOR

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:44.234
THE WORK I DID IN JULY. MY

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:50.240
CHECK WAS $12,276.42 FOR 14

00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:53.243
FULL TIME CHILDREN IN MY CARE.

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:56.846
MY MONTHLY EXPENSES. SO I

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:58.748
GROUPED THEM. OKAY, BUT I DID A

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:00.350
BREAKDOWN. SO YOU GUYS, I'LL BE

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:02.385
HAPPY TO SHARE THE BREAKDOWN

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:06.156
WITH YOU LATER. HOUSING $2,701.

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:11.461
UTILITIES $1,462. GROCERIES.

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:15.532
AVERAGES $2,600 A MONTH.

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:19.736
TRANSPORTATION $1,280. AN

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:20.370

A WEEK, $2,800. BUSINESS

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:28.645
EXPENSES $1,239. THIS ALL ADDS

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:33.583
UP TO $12,082 PER MONTH. SO I

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:36.386
CAME OUT AHEAD THIS MONTH BY

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:38.521
$194, WHICH MEANS I CAN USE

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:39.455
THAT MONEY TOWARDS A FIELD TRIP

00:57:39.522 --> 00:57:42.559
OR TOWARDS CONFERENCES THAT I

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:43.827
WANT TO ATTEND TO STRENGTHEN MY

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.728
CHILD CARE, KNOWLEDGE AND MY

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:47.664
BUSINESS. NOW MY FOOD BILL WILL

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.599
CHANGE. IT GOES DOWN ABOUT $700

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.568
A MONTH DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR,

00:57:51.634 --> 00:57:55.705
BUT AGAIN, MY INCOME DROPS BY

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:59.843
2000 TO MAKE UP THE INCOME THAT

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:01.611
I'M LOSING. I WORK MOST

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:03.346
WEEKENDS. I TEACH CPR CLASSES

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:04.647
TO OTHER CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:07.750
IN MY COUNTY, TO BUSINESSES AND

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:10.153
TO TO THE COMMUNITY, AND I

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.422
TEACH CLASSES FOR OUR CPU

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:14.390
TRAINING FUND. THIS ALLOWS ME

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:16.559
TO COVER THE GAP DURING THE

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.561
SCHOOL YEAR AND TO BUY ITEMS

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:19.562
THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED, LIKE

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:21.898
HIGHCHAIRS AND PLAYPENS. AS YOU

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.700
CAN SEE, I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:26.436
EXTRA TO PUT INTO SAVINGS FOR

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:27.971
EMERGENCIES. GOD FORBID

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:28.471
SOMETHING BREAKS DOWN,

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:30.406
SOMETHING MAJOR THAT I HAVE TO

00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:32.742
PAY FOR, OR I HAVE A FAMILY

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:33.476
EMERGENCY AND I HAVE TO TAKE

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:36.079
SOME TIME OFF. I DON'T HAVE THE

00:58:36.145 --> 00:58:37.747
MONEY FOR THAT. THROUGH

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:38.915
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, WE

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:41.451
SECURED A 1.3% COLA THAT WILL

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:44.454
BE ADDED TO OUR COST OF CARE

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.623
PLUS PAYMENT. THAT COMES OUT TO

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:48.892
AN EXTRA $12 PER CHILD PER

00:58:48.958 --> 00:58:51.394
MONTH. SO IF YOU HAVE 14

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:53.463
CHILDREN ON SUBSIDIZED CARE,

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:56.332
THAT MEANS A WHOLE EXTRA $168 A

00:58:56.399 --> 00:59:02.672
MONTH. LOTS. WHILE WE GREATLY

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:04.440
APPRECIATE THIS ADDITIONAL PAY,

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:06.442
IT DOES NOT COVER WHAT WE

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:08.578
ACTUALLY NEED OR WHAT WE

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:09.712
DESERVE. I AM BLESSED THAT THE

00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:11.281
UNION HAS SECURED THE HEALTH

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:13.316
CARE BENEFITS FOR ANOTHER THREE

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:15.385
YEARS. THAT HELPS ME PAY FOR

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:16.386
ALL MY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:18.421
AND MEDICATION THAT I NEED TO

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:20.523
TAKE DAILY AS A DIABETIC,

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.326
SAVING ME AROUND $600 A MONTH.

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.528
WITHOUT THAT FUND, I WOULD HAVE

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:27.263
TO PAY ALL THAT MEDICATION OUT

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:28.598
OF POCKET, AND MY BOTTOM LINE

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:31.267
WOULD BE EVEN HARDER TO MEET.

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:33.469
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:34.637
CALIFORNIA ARE LUCKY TO HAVE

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.406
SUCH STRONG ADVOCATES ON OUR

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.408
SIDE, LIKE MEMBERS OF THE

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:40.476
SELECT COMMITTEE, AND WE VALUE

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:41.644
AND GREATLY APPRECIATE ALL THE

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:43.546
WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING ON OUR

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:45.481
BEHALF. WE HOPE THAT BY WORKING

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:47.850
TOGETHER, WE CAN GET TO THE

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:49.319
TRUE COST OF CARE IN THE NEAR

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:50.887
FUTURE. THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:53.323
TIME AND YOUR SUPPORT. THANK

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:54.490
YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. WE

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:56.926
APPRECIATE YOU KICKING THIS OFF

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:58.227
TO BRING THIS REALITY RIGHT TO

00:59:58.294 --> 00:59:59.662
OUR FACE. WE WOULD APPRECIATE

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.297
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE TO SHARE

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:03.499
YOUR NUMBERS AS WELL, IF YOU

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:04.500
DON'T MIND. ABSOLUTELY. AND WE

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.302
HAVE TWO PEOPLE BEHIND YOU,

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:07.403
SALIMA AND SHANNON. THAT WILL

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.505
BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THAT.

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:10.773
OKAY? OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD. THANK

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.375

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:13.609
JUST WANT TO WELCOME ASSEMBLY

CAN DO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:25.021
QUALITY, AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE

01:00:25.088 --> 01:00:26.656
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.958
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:30.226
FAMILIES TO THRIVE. FOR

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.462
CHILDREN TO GET THAT THAT GOOD

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.097
FOUNDATION, FOR THEM TO THRIVE

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:35.865
IN THEIR LIVES. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.433
I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THESE

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.801
ISSUES BACK WHEN I HAD CHILDREN.

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:42.605
AND THEY ARE 27 AND 30 NOW. AND

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:43.706

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:50.747
LISTENING, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.515
PEOPLE ACTING. AND I DO BELIEVE

PRIORITY FOR US. I BELIEVE WE

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.232
ROUND, BUT WE LIKE TO REMIND

ADVOCATES AND FROM PROVIDERS

01:02:58.741 --> 01:02:59.775
LIKE THOSE WE'VE ALREADY HEARD

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:05.281
AND IT REMINDS US HOW MUCH WORK

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:06.649
WE STILL HAVE TO DO TO SUPPORT

REMARKS THAT THE REALITY IS

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.525
THAT THE DEMAND FOR AFFORDABLE,

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:17.527
HIGH QUALITY CHILD CARE

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:19.996
SURPASSES THE AVAILABLE

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.597
RESOURCES. NEARLY HALF OF

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:23.666
PARENTS WHO COULDN'T FIND CHILD

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:24.600
CARE CITE AFFORDABILITY AS THE

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.736
TOP REASON. AND I KNOW THAT'S

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:28.538
WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. AT THE

SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN RECENT

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.715
YEARS. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.350
TOGETHER, WE HAVE NEARLY

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:42.585
DOUBLED THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:43.753

2019 20 TO 6.4 BILLION TOTAL

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.561

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.763
THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CHILDREN

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:54.697

TO MORE THAN 378,000 IN 2425.

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:05.474
WE'VE NEGOTIATED OUR FIRST AND

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:06.742
SUBSEQUENT MOU BETWEEN THE

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:08.277

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.655
INCLUDES ADDITIONAL PROGRESS

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:21.591
TOWARD IMPLEMENTING AN

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:22.525
ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY FOR HOW

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:25.361
WE SET RATES AND A SINGLE RATE

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:26.562
STRUCTURE. AND IT BUILDS ON

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:28.397
COMMITMENTS WE'VE MADE TO

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:30.199
PROVIDING HEALTH CARE BENEFITS,

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.734
RETIREMENT AND PROFESSIONAL

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.936
TRAINING. IT ALSO INCLUDES A

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:34.537
COST OF LIVING, ADJUSTMENT TO

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.906
THE COST OF CARE, PLUS RATE

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.674
PAYMENTS, AND A ONE TIME

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:39.775
STABILIZATION PAYMENT TO BE

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:41.577
ISSUED BY JANUARY 1ST, 2026.

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:44.380
THAT AGREEMENT IS TENTATIVE AND

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:46.148
PENDING FORMAL RATIFICATION BY

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:47.750
BOTH PARTIES. WE'VE ALSO TAKEN

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.452
SOME INITIAL STEPS TO UNIFY OUR

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.554
REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURES,

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:52.755
WHICH WERE HISTORICALLY DIVIDED

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.490
BETWEEN THE WAY THAT WE MANAGE

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:55.725
THEM ON THE VOUCHER SIDE,

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:56.926
THROUGH THE REGIONAL MARKET

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.361
SURVEYS AND THE STANDARD

01:04:58.427 --> 01:04:59.495
REIMBURSEMENT RATE, WHICH WAS

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.197
APPLICABLE TO DIRECT CONTRACTED

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:03.399
PROGRAMS. AND WE'VE TAKEN SOME

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.567
INITIAL STEPS RECENTLY TOWARD

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.936
REFORMING THE STRUCTURE OF THE

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:07.503
CALWORKS CHILDCARE STAGES BY

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.472
LAUNCHING A CONSOLIDATION

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:10.573
WORKGROUP TO CLARIFY

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.407
RESPONSIBILITIES AND IDENTIFY

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:14.243
HOW TO ESTABLISH A MORE

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.645
COORDINATED SYSTEM AND MANAGE

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:19.949
THE CONTINUITY OF CARE. WE'RE

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:21.317
PROUD OF ALL THIS PROGRESS, AND

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:23.686
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.421
WORK THAT REMAINS TO BE DONE,

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:26.989
SO THAT THE SUPPLY OF

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:27.823
AFFORDABLE, QUALITY CHILDCARE

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.292
IS MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:30.559
PARENTS IN OUR STATE. THE

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.328
COMMITTEE DID ALSO ASK ME TO

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:34.430
TOUCH ON THE IMPACT OF H.R. ONE,

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.932
OR THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL, THE

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:37.600
RECONCILIATION BILL, AT THE

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:38.534
FEDERAL LEVEL. I WILL VERY

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.970
BRIEFLY JUST SAY THAT MOST OF

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.271
THE IMPACTS ON CHILD CARE

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:44.507
RELATED TO H.R. ONE ARE MORE

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:45.641
INDIRECT. THERE ARE NOT

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:46.475
PROVISIONS RELATED TO CHILD

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:48.611
CARE IN A WAY THAT THERE ARE

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.913
FOR MEDICAID OR THE SNAP

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.149
PROGRAM. THE CALFRESH PROGRAM

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:54.984
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT SAID,

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.787
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE BILL WILL

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:59.488
MAKE DEVASTATING CUTS TO THE

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:00.356
SAFETY NET AND THAT THOSE

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:01.590
MEDICAID AND SUPPLEMENTAL

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:03.559
NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.395
CUTS, AMONG OTHERS, WILL RESULT

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:07.630
IN REALLY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OF

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:09.231
BENEFITS FOR FAMILIES THAT

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.966
CREATE ADDITIONAL HARDSHIPS AND

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.501
IMPACTS TO HEALTH, WELL-BEING,

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:13.436
RATES OF POVERTY, RATES OF

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.538
CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT, AND

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.640
THAT THE BILL ALSO RESULTS IN

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:18.441
REALLY SIGNIFICANT COST SHIFTS

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:20.476
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:21.744
THE STATE THAT WILL DESTABILIZE

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.379
AND CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:26.349
STATE BUDGET. WE ARE WORKING TO

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:27.650
IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.618
THAT BILL TO THAT IMPACTS CDSS

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:31.320
PROGRAMS DIRECTLY, IN WHATEVER

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:32.488
WAYS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:34.357
MITIGATE HARM AND LOOK FORWARD

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.959
TO WORKING WITH YOU RELATED TO

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:37.493
THE IMPACTS TO THE STATE'S

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.228
BUDGET. SO IN CLOSING, I JUST

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:40.529
WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.565
ALL OF OUR WORK TOGETHER ON

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:43.566
THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. I KNOW

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.634
THAT NONE OF US CAN ADDRESS

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:46.369
THESE CHALLENGES ALONE. IT

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:47.803
TAKES PARTNERSHIP TO ACHIEVE

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:48.604
OUR VISION OF AFFORDABLE, HIGH

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:52.141
QUALITY CHILD CARE FOR ALL

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:52.775
CALIFORNIANS, AND WE LOOK

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:53.909
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.378
MAKE THAT VISION A REALITY.

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:57.747
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE

01:06:57.813 --> 01:07:01.117
THE COMMENTS. GREAT CHAIR AND

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:01.684
MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:03.419
NAME IS LAURA PRYOR, AND I'M

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.454
THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT THE

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.056
CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:08.557
CENTER. WE ARE A NONPARTISAN

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:10.559
RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS NONPROFIT

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.428
THAT USES OUR BUDGET EXPERTISE

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:14.463
TO ADVANCE PUBLIC POLICIES TO

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.032
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:17.733
CALIFORNIANS. WE APPRECIATE

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.802
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THIS

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.237
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AROUND

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.438
CHILDCARE ACCESS AND

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:24.707
AFFORDABILITY. THE MOST RECENT

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:26.342
FISCAL OUTLOOK FROM THE

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.676
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.044
IDENTIFIED CHILDCARE EXPANSION

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:31.680
AS ONE OF THE KEY DRIVERS OF

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:33.549
STATE SPENDING GROWTH. WHILE

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:34.450
THIS MAY LEAD SOME TO BELIEVE

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.852
THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:37.453
ADEQUATELY PRIORITIZING

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.588
CHILDCARE, MY REMARKS TODAY

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:41.857
EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS NOT THE

01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:43.392
CASE. I'LL DO SO BY ELABORATING

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:45.928
ON THE FOLLOWING THREE POINTS.

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.663
FIRST, THE COST OF CHILDCARE IS

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.766
TOO HIGH. SECOND, THE STATE HAS

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:51.534
NOT FUNDED THE SUPPLY OF

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.469
AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE ANYWHERE

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:56.539
CLOSE TO THE DEMAND. AND THIRD,

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:57.506
THE STATE CONTINUES TO PAY

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.442
CHILDCARE PROVIDERS LOW WAGES,

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:02.645
FURTHER STRAINING OUR PROGRAMS.

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.647
BEFORE DIVING INTO THESE THREE

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:06.549
POINTS, I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.984
IMPORTANT CONTEXT. WHEN THE

01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:10.920
STATE FACES A SHORTFALL, OUR

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:11.720
EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS,

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:14.223
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS OUR PROGRAMS,

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:17.793
ARE ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE CUT.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.228
FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA'S

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:21.397
SYSTEM WEATHERED SEVERE CUTS AS

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:23.265
A RESULT OF THE GREAT RECESSION,

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.301
SLASHING THOUSANDS OF

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:27.303
SUBSIDIZED SPACES AND WAGES FOR

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:29.338
PROVIDERS OVER THE PAST 16

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:31.574
YEARS. IN RESPONSE TO TIRELESS

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.809
ADVOCACY, STATE LEADERS HAVE

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:36.545
INCREMENTALLY RESTORED SPACES

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:37.780
AND APPROXIMATELY NOW THE

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:39.615
AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR CHILDCARE,

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:41.517
THE AMOUNT OF SPACES IS 50%

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:43.752
HIGHER THAN PRIOR TO THE GREAT

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.621
RECESSION. SO WHILE IT IS TRUE

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:47.289
THAT FUNDING FOR THE SYSTEM HAS

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.525
INCREASED, IT HAS NOT BEEN

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:51.193
ENOUGH TO UNDO THE NEGATIVE

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.729
CONSEQUENCES OF PAST DEEP CUTS

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.598
TO THESE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:57.399
VITAL SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.535
HELP PARENTS GO TO WORK.

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:00.736
FUNDING INCREASES HAVE NOT

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.338
EQUATED TO COMPREHENSIVE

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:03.739
IMPROVEMENTS. GIVEN THE THREE

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:05.541
REASONS THAT I MENTIONED, WHICH

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:08.644
I'LL NOW ELABORATE ON. FIRST,

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:10.613
THE COST OF CHILDCARE IS TOO

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:13.315
HIGH. SPECIFICALLY, OUR RECENT

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:14.416
ANALYSIS AT THE BUDGET CENTER

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:16.418
SHOWED THAT FOR A SINGLE MOTHER

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.153
WITH AN INFANT AND A SCHOOL

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.489
AGED CHILD, SHE WILL SPEND 62%

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:22.224
OF HER INCOME ON CHILDCARE

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:24.827
ALONE WITHOUT ACCESS TO A STATE

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.263
SUBSIDY. THIS ISSUE IS FURTHER

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:29.365
EXACERBATED FOR WOMEN OF COLOR

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:31.867
WHO CONTINUE TO FACE PERSISTENT

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.435
WAGE GAPS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.071
COST OF CARE FOR AN INFANT AND

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:38.841
SCHOOL AGED CHILD IS NEARLY 71%

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.110
OF THE MEDIAN SALARY FOR LATINX

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.412
SINGLE MOTHERS. GIVEN THESE

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.648
UNSUSTAINABLE COSTS, ACCESS TO

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.483
STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE IS

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:50.352
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL DUE TO THE

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:51.520
INCREDIBLE WORK FROM MANY OF

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.656
THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. FAMILY

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:55.324
FEES FOR STATE SUBSIDIZED

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:57.626
CHILDCARE WERE REFORMED IN 2023.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.395
THIS ELIMINATED FAMILY FEES,

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:01.564
MAKING CHILD CARE FREE FOR

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.499
FAMILIES BELOW 75% OF THE STATE

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:06.068
MEDIAN INCOME, AND CAPPED FEES

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.938
AT 1% FOR THOSE BETWEEN 75 AND

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:11.574
85% OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.442
HOWEVER, TO GET THIS LOW OR NO

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.544
COST CHILDCARE, THERE HAS TO BE

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:16.478
ROOM IN THE SYSTEM. WHICH

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.547
BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT.

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:20.583
THE DEMAND FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILD

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:22.685
CARE SPACES FAR EXCEEDS THE

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:25.621
SUPPLY. OUR ANALYSIS IN 2022

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.590
SHOWED THAT MAINLY DUE TO THE

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:30.359
LACK OF SUPPLY, ONLY 11% OF

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:32.561
CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR CHILDCARE

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:33.729
AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WERE

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:36.265
ACTUALLY ENROLLED A YEAR LATER,

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:39.201
IN 2023, THIS NUMBER DID GO UP

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.570
TO 14%. HOWEVER, WHILE THESE

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.138
NUMBERS ARE TRENDING IN THE

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:44.540
RIGHT DIRECTION, IT STILL MEANS

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:47.242
THAT ONLY 1 IN 7 CHILDREN

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:48.644
ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:49.778
CHILDCARE ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT.

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:51.614
THEREFORE, THE REALITY IS THAT

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.282
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:54.483
FAMILIES ARE STILL LEFT ON

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:56.151
WAITING LISTS, CONFRONTING THE

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:58.387
EXORBITANT COST OF CHILDCARE

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:00.789
AND FORCED TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:01.890
DECISIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.626
KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE FURTHER

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:06.028
WIDENS RACIAL INEQUITIES IN OUR

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.363
STATE. NAMELY, WE KNOW THAT

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.231
LATINX, NATIVE, AND BLACK

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:09.865
CHILDREN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.333
ELIGIBLE FOR STATE SUBSIDIZED

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.435
CHILDCARE, MEANING THAT WHEN

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:15.270
THE STATE UNDERFUNDS OUR SYSTEM,

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:16.905
THESE FAMILIES ARE HIT THE

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:18.707
HARDEST, PERPETUATING EXISTING

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:21.010
STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES IN OUR

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.612
STATE. WITH THE GAPS TO ACCESS

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.447
CLEARLY LAID OUT. LET'S NOT

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:26.582
FORGET THAT EVEN IF THE STATE

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:29.351
WERE TO FUND 100% OF THE UNMET

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.453
NEED FOR CHILDCARE, WE NEED A

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.321
WORKFORCE TO BE ABLE TO MEET

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.424
THAT NEED. THIS BRINGS ME TO MY

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:36.692
THIRD POINT. DESPITE BEING

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.360
ESSENTIAL, CHILDCARE HAS

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:40.396
REMAINED ONE OF THE LOWEST PAID

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.331
PROFESSIONS. IN FACT, ASIDE

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.432
FROM THE COST OF CARE

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:45.534
SUPPLEMENT, STATE LEADERS HAVE

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:46.335
ONLY UPDATED VOUCHER BASED

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.737
PAYMENT RATES FOR CHILDCARE

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:49.605
PROVIDERS THREE TIMES IN THE

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.374
PAST NINE YEARS. MORE

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.509
SPECIFICALLY, OUR RECENT

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:55.744
ANALYSIS OF THE BUDGET CENTER

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:58.147
SHOWED THE FOLLOWING

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:00.549
DISAPPOINTING TRENDS. FIRST,

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.551
INCREASES IN RATES REMAIN FAR

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:04.253
BELOW THE INCREASE IN THE

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:05.888
MINIMUM WAGE. SO BECAUSE

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:07.623
PROVIDERS HAVE TO PAY THEIR

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.324
STAFF A MINIMUM WAGE, THIS

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:11.326
MISMATCH FURTHER CUTS INTO

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.529
PROVIDERS PAY, MAKING IT EVEN

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:15.464
HARDER TO EXPAND ACCESS. IN

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:17.166
FACT, WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTAL

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:19.301
EVIDENCE THAT THIS LOW PAY HAS

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:20.969
RESULTED IN HIGHER CO-PAYS FOR

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.671
FAMILIES. DESPITE THE FAMILY

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:24.440
FEE REFORM THAT HAPPENED IN

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:27.242
2023. SECONDLY, DESPITE OFTEN

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:28.977
HAVING THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:30.646
AND WORKING WITH THE SAME AGE

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.347
GROUPS AS ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:34.883
SCHOOL TEACHERS, WAGES FOR

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.351
PROFESSIONALS ARE FAR FROM

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:38.053
PARITY WITH SCHOOL BASED

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.289
TEACHERS. SPECIFICALLY,

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:43.425
PROFESSIONALS MAKE ONLY 39% OF

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.660
THE KINDERGARTEN THROUGH EIGHTH

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.328
GRADE MEDIAN HOURLY WAGE. IF

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.564
TRENDS CONTINUE, IT WILL TAKE

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:52.067
NEARLY 60 YEARS FOR

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:52.701
PROFESSIONALS WAGES TO CATCH UP

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:54.970
TO THE MEDIAN WAGE OF ALL

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.638
WORKERS. MEDIAN HOURLY EARNINGS

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.373
FOR PROFESSIONALS ARE LESS THAN

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.809
PARKING ATTENDANTS. IF PAY

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.277
CONTINUES ON THIS TREND, WE

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:04.513
WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE VALUABLE,

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.714
SKILLED AND QUALIFIED PROVIDERS

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:08.283
TO OTHER SECTORS, FURTHER

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.451
EXACERBATING THE ACCESS AND

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:11.253
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES OUR STATE

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.355
CURRENTLY FACES. AND LET'S NOT

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:14.556
FORGET THAT THIS IS A PRIMARILY

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.792
WOMEN OF COLOR WORKFORCE.

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:18.026
PAYING THIS ESSENTIAL WORKFORCE

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:21.063
LOW WAGES IS THE DIRECT RESULT

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.364
OF RACIST AND SEXIST

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:24.900
STEREOTYPES THAT DEVALUE

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:25.501
CAREGIVING WORK AND EXACERBATE

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:28.604
THE GENDER WAGE GAP. IN SUMMARY,

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.305
DESPITE RECENT INCREASES IN

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:31.874
FUNDING FOR THE SYSTEM,

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.509
FAMILIES STILL CAN'T FIND

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:35.277
AFFORDABLE CARE AND THE SUPPLY

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:36.645
PROVIDERS IS AT RISK OF

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:37.846
DWINDLING, PERPETUATING RACIAL

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.348
AND GENDER INEQUITIES IN OUR

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:43.085
STATE. IF BUDGETS ARE

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.019
STATEMENTS AND VALUES OF OUR

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:48.290
PRIORITIES, THEN. AND WE VALUE

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:50.459
A CHILDCARE SYSTEM THAT IS

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.127
SUPPORTIVE AND EQUITABLE FOR

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:52.594
FAMILIES, CHILDREN AND

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:53.428
PROVIDERS, IT'S TIME FOR THE

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:55.430
STATE TO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES,

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:56.799
INCLUDING RAISING REVENUE

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:59.434
THROUGH REDUCING TAX BREAKS FOR

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:00.669
CORPORATIONS AND RAISING TAXES

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.271
ON THOSE WHO ARE GETTING A

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:04.873
WINDFALL OF TAX CUTS FROM THE

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:05.607
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IT IS

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:08.043
CRITICAL FOR STATE LEADERS TO

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.511
PRESENT A DIFFERENT VISION FOR

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:10.746
THIS STATE THAN THE ONE TRUMP

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:12.848
HAS LAID OUT BY NOT FULLY

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:14.850
FUNDING AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE.

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.685
THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:17.553
HURTING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:20.622
OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. THIS IS A

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:21.790
POLICY AREA WHERE CALIFORNIA IS

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:23.492
FALLING BEHIND, PRESENTING AN

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:25.360
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STATE TO

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:26.862
IMPROVE HOW WE VALUE OUR

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:27.563
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BY

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:29.331
EXPANDING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:31.500
CARE AND PAYING PROVIDERS A

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:33.402
FAIR AND JUST WAGE. THANK YOU,

01:14:33.468 --> 01:14:36.672
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.440
APPRECIATE THAT. I MUST SAY, I

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:40.609
HEAR DELAINE EASTIN IN THE

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:42.611
BACKGROUND TELLING ME THIS. SO

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:44.513
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.681
SHE'S HERE IN THE ROOM. SO BE

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.449
AWARE. OKAY. WE WILL GO AHEAD

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.685
AND HAVE YOU SPEAK. THANK YOU

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:53.388
VERY MUCH. ALEXA, DO I NEED TO

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.390
TURN THIS ON? NO. YOU'RE GOOD.

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:58.460
OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIR

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.295
CO-CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:02.431
SELECT COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:03.732
ALEXA FRANKENBERG. I'M THE

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:04.766
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CHILD

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.568
CARE PROVIDERS UNITED, A UNION

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:08.804
THAT REPRESENTS 70,000 FAMILY

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:11.173
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.908
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:13.475
IN ALL OF YOUR COMMUNITIES

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:16.445
THROUGHOUT THE STATE, INCLUDING.

01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:18.247
WE HAVE A GREAT LEADER UP IN

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:19.715
YOUR DISTRICT, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:22.818
HEDWIG ANITA, WHO YOU HEARD

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.519
FROM EARLIER, AS WELL AS MYRON,

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:26.555
WHO YOU WILL HEAR FROM, AND ALL

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.690
OF THE FOLKS IN YELLOW SHIRTS.

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:29.591
HERE ARE SOME OF THE MANY

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:31.460
PROVIDERS THAT I HAVE THE HONOR

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:32.461
OF WORKING WITH EVERY DAY. AND

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:34.496
ON BEHALF OF THEM, I WANT TO

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:36.098
THANK THE THIS COMMITTEE. I

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.666
WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY AT

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.501
LARGE FOR YOUR CONTINUED

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:40.569
PRIORITIZATION AND CHAMPIONING

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.371
OF THIS ISSUE. AND THERE IS

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:43.672
MORE WORK TO DO. AS EVERYONE

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:46.341
HAS SAID, I WILL TALK BRIEFLY

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.677
ABOUT OUR TO THAT DIRECTOR TOYA

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:50.245
MENTIONED, BUT THEN I WILL

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.214
MOSTLY FOCUS ON THE WORK WE

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.515
STILL HAVE AHEAD. SO WITHIN THE

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:54.816
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, CCPA

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:56.385
REACHED A TENTATIVE AGREEMENT

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.287
OR TO WITH THE STATE OF

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.355
CALIFORNIA THAT, UPON

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:01.890
RATIFICATION, WILL BE OUR

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:02.691
UNION'S THIRD CONTRACT WITH THE

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:05.961
STATE. THIS AGREEMENT, LIKE TWO

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:06.995
PRIOR CONTRACTS, MAKES

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:08.297
IMPROVEMENTS AND ADVANCES IN

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:10.966
IMPROVING PAY, BENEFITS AND

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:11.733
WORKING CONDITIONS FOR HOME

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.403
BASED CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHO

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:15.671
PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:17.339
SERVING FAMILIES LIKE NGUYEN

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.474
AND FAMILIES AROUND CALIFORNIA.

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:20.809
CHILDCARE INVESTMENT IS

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.711
ESSENTIAL BOTH IN STRONG

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.113
ECONOMIC TIMES AND LEAN TIMES,

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.715
AS INFLATION, TARIFF AND

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.417
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CUTBACKS, TO

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:30.052
NAME A FEW THINGS THAT FAMILIES

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:31.954
ARE FACING. SQUEEZE WORKING

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.556
FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS ALIKE.

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:37.826
RTA IS A COLLECTIVE VICTORY.

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:38.894
THIS TO SECURES PROVIDERS HARD

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.596
WON BENEFITS, INCREASES CURRENT

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:44.266
RATES, PROVIDES THE ONE TIME

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.501
STABLIZATION PAYMENTS AND OTHER

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.536
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:16:47.602 --> 01:16:49.304
THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED EARLIER.

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:51.606
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CELEBRATE OUR

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:53.342
WORK, BUT THERE IS MORE WORK

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:54.609
AHEAD, AND SO I WANT TO SPEND

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.678
MY TIME OUTLINING THAT WORK

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:58.280
BECAUSE AS EVERYONE HERE HAS

01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:00.282
SAID, THE STATUS QUO IS NOT

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.517
OKAY. AS YOU HEARD FROM LARA,

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:04.486
THE NEEDS ARE IMMENSE AND OUR

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.688
WORK CONTINUES. CENTURIES OF

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.557
UNJUST TREATMENT AND PAY CANNOT

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:10.659
BE UNDONE IN A FEW CONTRACTS OR

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.627
A FEW YEARS. CCPA PROVIDERS

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:14.629
STAND COMMITTED TO SECURING A

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:15.864
COST OF CARE STRUCTURE THAT

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:17.532
MEETS PROVIDERS NEEDS, ENABLING

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:20.002
THEM TO STAY OPEN TO SERVE

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:21.336
FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:23.939
AS YOU HEARD FROM ANITA, COST

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.374
OF CARE IS NOT A CONCEPT OR A

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.542
THEORY. IT IS A REALITY. IT IS

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:28.777
DOLLARS AND CENTS. AND SO WHILE

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:29.778
THE CONVERSATIONS CAN GET

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:31.580
COMPLICATED, THE IDEA IS SIMPLE

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.248
CONNECT CHILD CARE PROVIDER

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.118
RATES WITH THE COST OF

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.953
PROVIDING CHILD CARE FOR US.

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:38.520
THIS HAS SEVERAL PRIORITIES

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:41.590
THAT I WANT TO TOUCH ON BRIEFLY.

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:43.625
FIRST, PAY PROVIDERS A FAIR

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:45.594
WAGE. AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED,

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.763
PROVIDERS CANNOT AFFORD TO STAY

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:49.831
IN THIS INDUSTRY. IT IS A

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:51.366
REVOLVING DOOR. IF PROVIDERS

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:53.635
CAN CAN PAY THEMSELVES. AND AS

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:55.203
YOU HEARD, IT'S A BIG IF.

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:56.605
PROVIDERS EARN CURRENTLY AS

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:59.574
LITTLE AS $7 PER HOUR. SO THE

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:01.343
IMPORTANT WORK OF EDUCATING AND

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.578
CARING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:06.782
DEMANDS A FAIR PAY RATE, ONE

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:08.583
THAT IS FAR ABOVE WHERE IT IS

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:09.851
RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS CURRENTLY

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:12.454
LESS THAN HALF OF MINIMUM WAGE.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:13.789
SECOND, WE NEED RATES THAT

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.457
VALUE ALL THE HOURS WORKED. WE

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.359
NEED TO PAY FOR PREP TIME,

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:19.428
CLEAN UP TIME, AND ALL THE

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:20.629
HOURS WORKED THAT ARE ABOVE 40

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:23.465
HOURS A WEEK. THIRD, WE NEED

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.534
MEANINGFUL TIME OFF, AND WE

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.269
NEED TO REFORM SOME OF THE

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.437
ANTIQUATED RULES THAT ALLOW

01:18:28.503 --> 01:18:29.704
PROVIDERS TIME AWAY FROM THEIR

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:32.240
HOME. I WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.608
TOUCH ON A STORY THAT ACTUALLY

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:34.776
CAME UP FOR US THIS WEEKEND.

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:37.045
ONE OF OUR BARGAINING TEAM

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:39.781
MEMBERS, WHO WAS PH¢N PROVIDER,

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:42.417
SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED THIS PAST

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:43.585
WEEKEND. SHE WAS FORTUNATE

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:45.620
ENOUGH TO CATCH SOME PRE-HEART

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.389
ATTACK SYMPTOMS. SHE SPENT

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:48.657
SEVERAL DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL.

01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:50.258
SHE HAS BEEN RELEASED, WHICH WE

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:52.561
ARE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR, BUT FFM

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:54.229
PROVIDERS HAVE NO PAID TIME OFF.

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:56.598
AND SO EVEN THOUGH SHE NEEDS TO

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.467
REST TO TAKE CARE OF HER HEALTH,

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:00.602
SHE IS FACED WITH AN UNENVIABLE

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.537
CHOICE OF DO I REST AND TAKE

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:03.872
CARE OF MYSELF AND DON'T GET

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:05.640
PAID? OR DO I PUSH MYSELF EVEN

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:07.209
THOUGH I KNOW I SHOULDN'T

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:08.510
BECAUSE I NEED THIS MONEY TO

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.378
HELP SUPPORT MY FAMILY? THOSE

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.414
ARE NOT CHOICES THAT THE FOURTH

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:13.915
BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:15.617
SHOULD BE FORCING WOMEN LIKE

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:17.419
HER. AND THE STORY IS REPEATED

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.488
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:21.256
CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT TO DO

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:23.592
BETTER. FOURTH, WE NEED TO

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:25.193
IMPROVE SUPPORT FOR PROVIDERS

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.996
WHO ARE WORKING IN AREAS FACING

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:29.131
EMERGENCIES OR DISASTERS. THIS

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:31.666
IS NOT JUST A RURAL AREA. THIS

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:32.567
IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:34.469
IMPACTS ALL OF US IN THE STATE.

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:36.471
WE NEED TO. PROVIDERS IN

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:38.607
PARTICULAR, PAY A REALLY

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:39.474
IMPORTANT ROLE IN SUPPORTING

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:40.942
FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER DISASTER

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:43.612
WORKERS, AND IT'S REALLY

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:44.479
CRITICAL TO HAVE THE STABILITY

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.615
THAT PROVIDERS NEED TO BE ABLE

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:47.682
TO PROVIDE STABILITY TO THOSE

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:49.351
FAMILIES WHO ARE PLAYING

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:50.986
IMPORTANT ROLES IN OUR

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:51.920
DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA. FIFTH,

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:53.455
WE'VE GOT TO STABILIZE

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:55.590
PROVIDERS WHO ARE FACING THE

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.659
LOSS OF FOUR YEAR OLDS TO TICK,

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.494
AS YOU HEARD EARLIER, AND FIND

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:00.896
WAYS TO BETTER INTEGRATE FAMILY

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.898
CHILD CARE INTO THE MIXED

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:03.431
DELIVERY SYSTEM. HERE IN

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:04.633
CALIFORNIA. THEY PLAY A

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:06.334
CRITICAL ROLE, AND IT ENABLES

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:09.538
TRUE PARENTAL CHOICE TO ALLOW

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.273
PARENTS OF FOUR YEAR OLDS AND

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:12.474
PARENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:15.143
CALIFORNIA TO REALLY CHOOSE THE

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.511
PROVIDERS THAT THEY THINK BEST

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:17.879
MEET THEIR FAMILY'S NEEDS. AS

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:19.648
YOU HEARD FROM QUINN EARLIER.

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:21.349
FINALLY, WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:22.684
TO VALUE CARE THAT MEETS

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.286
FAMILY'S NEEDS, SUCH AS

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:26.855
INCENTIVIZING HARD TO HARD TO

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.290
FIND CARE FOR INFANTS, ENSURING

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:29.958
CARE DURING NONTRADITIONAL

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:32.594
HOURS, AND AND ADEQUATELY

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:33.261
PAYING FOR TRANSPORTATION,

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.629
INCLUDING THE STAFF AND OTHER

01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:36.932
THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED TO

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:37.465
PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:39.467
SCHOOLS, TO APPOINTMENTS, AND

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:41.570
OTHER THINGS THAT CHILDREN NEED.

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:43.305
THIS MAY SOUND LIKE A LONG LIST,

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:44.539
BUT PROVIDERS WORK HAS BEEN

01:20:44.606 --> 01:20:46.575
UNDERVALUED FOR SO LONG. IT IS

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.977
TIME THAT WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:49.878
THE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:52.347
THAT THIS BRINGS. PROVIDER LOW

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:54.482
PAY CREATES A REVOLVING DOOR OF

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.684
PROVIDERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.820
STAY OPEN. DATA SHOW DATA FROM

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:00.255
THE STATE SHOW THAT ONE

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:02.457
PROVIDER EACH HOUR CLOSES,

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.326
WHICH IMPACTS, ON AVERAGE, FOUR

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:06.494
CHILDREN PER HOUR. IT'S

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.830
CRITICAL WE ESTABLISH A

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:09.598
STRUCTURE THAT VALUES THE

01:21:09.664 --> 01:21:10.332
CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDERS MADE,

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:11.600
INCLUDING ALL OF THE UNSEEN

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.435
WORK THEY DO, AND THEN THE

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:14.803
LEGISLATURE CAN BEGIN THE

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:16.938
IMPORTANT WORK OF DETERMINING

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:18.006
HOW TO PHASE THIS IN WITH

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:20.542
EXISTING RESOURCES. I WANT TO

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:23.345
BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME DATA THAT

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:25.714
RECENTLY THE STATE SUBMITTED TO

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.616
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, JUST TO

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:28.617
HIGHLIGHT WHAT I THINK EVERYONE

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:31.353
IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT THE

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:34.089
CURRENT SYSTEM IS BROKEN FOR

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:35.223
PAYING CHILD CARE PROVIDERS.

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:36.391
DATA SHOW THAT FAMILY CHILD

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:38.460
CARE PROVIDERS SUFFER THE MOST.

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:40.195
WE WERE GLAD TO SEE IN THE

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:41.796
STATE'S REPORT TO THE FEDERAL

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:42.631
GOVERNMENT THAT THEY

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:44.232
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, AND I QUOTE,

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:45.500
THE GAP BETWEEN SUBSIDY RATES

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:48.403
AND THE FULL COST OF CARE

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:49.371
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:51.640
FAMILY CHILD CARE. SO WHAT THAT

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:53.308
MEANS IS FOR A FAMILY CHILD

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:54.843
CARE PROVIDER CARING FOR AN

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.711
INFANT IN LOS ANGELES, THEIR

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:57.779
RATE ONLY COVERS 30% OF THE

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:00.415
COST OF CARE VERSUS 51% FOR A

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:03.351
CENTER. WE MUST DO BETTER FOR

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.220
EVERYONE, AND IT'S PARTICULARLY

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:05.820
CRITICAL TO BEGIN INVESTMENT

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:08.156
WHERE THE GAP IS GREATEST.

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:09.591
FAMILY CHILD CARE. IN CLOSING,

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.593
WE BELIEVE THIS COMMITTEE HAS

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.427
AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY TO

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:14.796
KEEP THE SPOTLIGHT ON HOW WE'VE

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:15.430
GOT TO MOVE TO CHILDCARE.

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:16.431
REIMBURSEMENT BASED ON THE COST

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:18.700
OF CARE IS PART OF THE SOLUTION

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.568
FOR FAMILIES IN THIS STATE.

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.470
FAIR PAY, WHICH IS ADEQUATE,

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:24.606
TIMELY AND RELIABLE, WILL

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.775
ENSURE PROVIDERS CAN STAY OPEN

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.576
AND ALSO ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.312
ENTER THE FIELD AS ITS

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:32.447
WORKFORCE AGES. PROVIDERS NEED

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:33.715
TO NOT JUST CONTINUE TO TREAD

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:35.517
WATER AS THEY DO NOW, BUT THEY

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:37.585
NEED TO THRIVE. WHICH COST OF

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:39.354
CARE WILL ENABLE THEM TO DO? WE

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:40.655
LOOK FORWARD TO UPDATING THE

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.490
COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:43.491
MORE BROADLY ON THE PROGRESS

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:44.626
AND OUR SOON TO FORM JOINT

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:45.894
LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE WITH

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.395
THE STATE TO RECOMMEND A RATE

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:49.331
STRUCTURE AND AMOUNTS FOR BASED

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:51.333
AND ENHANCED RATES, INCLUDING

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:52.467
FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS, BY

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.369
NOVEMBER 30TH. THIS WILL EQUIP

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:56.571
YOU ALL IN YOUR 2026 BUDGETING

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.506
AND INVESTMENTS. WE ARE CLEAR

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:00.275
EYED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:02.344
CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE.

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.045
INDEED, PROVIDERS EXISTENCE, AS

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:05.313
YOU HEARD FROM ANITA, HAS BEEN

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.648
STRETCHING TOO FEW DOLLARS AS

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:08.616
FAR AS POSSIBLE TO MEET THE

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:09.918
NEEDS OF FAMILIES THEY SERVE

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.453
AND THEIR OWN FAMILIES. YET

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:13.521
THIS WORK IS TOO IMPORTANT TO

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:14.723
DELAY ANY LONGER. CALIFORNIA

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:17.726
MUST DO BETTER. THANK YOU.

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:20.362
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.497
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. BEFORE I GO

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:24.232
ANY FURTHER, I HAVE ASSEMBLY

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.468

TO QUESTIONS. DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:36.544
QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN BRING. GO

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.346
AHEAD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NGUYEN

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:40.582
YES, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. YOU

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:42.450
KNOW THE FORMER TWO THAT SPOKE

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:45.453
AS WELL AS YOU THREE UP HERE

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.858
MANY MOONS AGO, I BEFORE I HAD

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:52.293
KIDS AND WAS MARRIED, I DID THE

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.529
FOSTER ADOPTION PROGRAM AND I

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:56.398
TOOK IN A COUPLE BABIES. AND AT

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:59.000
THE TIME I WAS A SINGLE INCOME

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:00.735
PERSON AND TOOK IN THE BABIES,

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:02.504
BUT I WAS WORKING AT THE SAME

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.506
TIME, AND SO I WAS ABLE TO

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:05.774
ENROLL IN BEANSTALK OR CHILD

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.911
ACTION AND WAS ABLE TO HAVE THE

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:12.814
CHILD BE DROPPED OFF AT A HOME

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.016
BASED CHILD CARE. AND SHE WAS

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:17.419
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. THE CHILD

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:18.787
LEARNED SPANISH, SHE WAS GREAT.

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:20.455
AND IT WAS THEN THIS IS

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.524
PROBABLY OVER 20 YEARS AGO THAT

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:24.359
SHE EDUCATED ME ON WHAT SHE WAS

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:26.861
PAID, AND HOW IT WASN'T ENOUGH

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:28.396
FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ENDS

01:24:28.463 --> 01:24:31.499
MEET. AS A MATTER OF FACT,

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.268
THERE WAS SOME TIME WHERE I WAS

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:34.602
ABLE TO TAKE THE CHILD AND GO

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:36.471
ON VACATION, AND SHE SHARED

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:37.372
WITH ME THAT DURING THAT TIME

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:39.507
SHE WOULD NOT BE PAID AT ALL,

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:41.543
AND THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:42.877
ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:44.579
THE MORTGAGE PAY FOR ALL OF THE

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.948
THINGS THAT SHE HAS TO CONTINUE

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:47.849
TO KEEP HER HOME BASED CHILD

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.585
CARE CENTER GOING. AND SO I, I

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:52.520
PAID OUT OF CASH. SHE NEARLY

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:53.555
CRIED BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.256
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:57.459
BUT THIS WAS 20 YEARS AGO AND

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:59.727
OVER 20 YEARS AGO, ACTUALLY.

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:01.463
AND SO I'M I'M SEEING NOW

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.598
BECAUSE I'VE HAD MANY HOME

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:04.833
BASED CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:06.468
REACH OUT TO ME AND SAYS, YOU

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.970
NEED TO COME AND HEAR WHAT WE

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.839
HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND SEE WHAT

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.507
WE DO. AND I'VE PROBABLY

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:15.410
VISITED EIGHT NOW, HOME BASED

01:25:15.477 --> 01:25:17.045
IN MY DISTRICT, AND THEY'VE ALL

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:18.313
SAID THE EXACT SAME THING. AS A

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:21.149
MATTER OF FACT, ONE PROVIDER

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:22.750
TOLD ME THAT SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:25:22.817 --> 01:25:24.452
ANITA SAID, I MEAN, IT SOUNDS

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:26.387
LIKE HER STAFF MAKES MORE THAN

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.389
SHE DOES, THAT THEY MAKE SO

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:31.559
LITTLE THAT THEY'RE ON

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:33.328
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:35.663
AND I'M THINKING, WOW, YOU YOU

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:38.600
RUN THE BUSINESS AND YOU DON'T

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.368
GET ANY TIME OFF AND VERY

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:42.470
SIMILAR. SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:43.705
HER HUSBAND WAS SICK AND, YOU

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:45.406
KNOW, THEY'RE ON MEDI-CAL AND

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:47.475
HER KIDS GET FREE, YOU KNOW,

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:48.776
LUNCH. THIS IS BEFORE IT WAS

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:51.212
ALL, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING WAS

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.714
FREE. BUT BUT SHE LOVES THE

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.415
WORK. AND SHE KNOWS THAT IF SHE

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:56.651
DOESN'T DO THIS, ALL OF THE

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:58.353
OTHER FAMILIES THAT RELY ON HER

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.555
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE CHILD

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.257
CARE SO THAT THEY CAN GO TO

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:03.558
WORK WOULD ALSO SUFFER BECAUSE

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:05.960
THEY CAN'T FIND CHILD CARE THAT

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:06.528
IS AFFORDABLE FOR THEM. BUT

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:09.297
THIS IS ON THE COST OF ON OF

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.733
HER, OF THEM, OF THE HOME BASED

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:13.067
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AND SO

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:15.603
I'M WONDERING IF THIS WAS AN

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.505
ISSUE 20 PLUS YEARS AGO, WHY IS

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:19.641
IT STILL AN ISSUE NOW? AND I

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:21.376
WILL NOTE THIS I SERVE ON SIX

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:24.178
OTHER SELECT COMMITTEES, AND

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:25.346
THIS BY FAR OUTNUMBERS THE

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:26.948
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ATTEND

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.216
THE SELECT COMMITTEES OF ALL

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.051
THE SELECT COMMITTEES I SIT ON.

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:32.453
SO THIS THIS YES, IS AN

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.722
IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR US TO

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.424
CONTINUE TO HAVE AND TO

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:37.659
CONTINUE TO DISCUSS. BUT THE

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.294
QUESTION IS, YOU KNOW, IF THIS

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.595
WAS OVER 20 YEARS AGO AND THIS

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:42.730
WAS AN ISSUE, WHY IS IT STILL

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:44.699
AN ISSUE NOW? AND HOW COME WE

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:45.833
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.102
THIS OUT? AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:49.037
IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE.

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:51.272
ANYBODY WANT TO TAKE A STAB AT

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:54.309
THAT ONE? SPEAK TO WHAT I A FEW

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.511
REMARKS THAT I MADE ABOUT THE

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:58.713
GREAT RECESSION. SO 20 YEARS

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.450
AGO 2005 GREAT RECESSION 2012

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:05.920
WAS WHEN FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:07.455
DIPPED AT ITS LOWEST. SO THINGS

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:10.325
GOT WORSE BEFORE THE FUNDING

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:12.994
ACTUALLY INCREASED. AND AS

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:15.263
MENTIONED, THAT DRAMATIC

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:16.898
DECREASE IN FUNDING FOR SPACES

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.633
AND WAGES HAD LONG LASTING

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.468
IMPACTS THAT ONLY EXACERBATED

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:22.770
THE EXISTING ISSUES. SO THAT'S

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.606
DEFINITELY ONE PIECE OF THE

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:26.641
PUZZLE. I MEAN, THERE HASN'T

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:28.343
BEEN A LACK OF ATTENTION TO IT.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.979
AND I AGREE, THIS IS AN AMAZING

01:27:31.045 --> 01:27:32.614
CROWD AND WE HAVE BEEN IN

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.916
SACRAMENTO WITH CCPA SO MANY

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:36.284
TIMES. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:38.486
START PAYING TAXES HERE, AS ARE

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:41.589
MANY OF OUR MEMBERS. BUT YOU

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:43.358
KNOW, THIS TAKES REAL MONEY TO

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.659
FIX. AND I WANTED TO BE CLEAR

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:47.662
ABOUT THAT. AND WE ARE VERY

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:48.696
PROUD OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:50.431
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO NEGOTIATE,

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:52.367
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:53.635
FORTHCOMING THROUGH THE

01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:54.802
LEADERSHIP OF THE WOMEN'S

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:57.405
CAUCUS AND OTHERS. BUT THIS IS

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:58.940
NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT GOT

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:00.375
CREATED OVERNIGHT. AND SO WE

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.877
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO NEED

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:06.347
BOLD LEADERSHIP TO INVEST EVEN

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:08.883
WHEN TIMES ARE BAD. IF WE ARE

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.418
GOING TO REALLY BREAK THIS

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:12.553
TREND THAT YOU ARE RAISING,

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.288
THAT HAS I HAVE BEEN IN THIS

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:16.491
WORK FOR 20 YEARS, WHICH I

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:17.458
DON'T ALWAYS LOVE TO ADMIT, BUT

01:28:17.525 --> 01:28:19.527
IT HAS BEEN THE SAME STORY. AND

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:21.863
WHILE THERE'S BEEN GREAT

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:22.296
PROGRESS UNDER THIS

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:23.631
ADMINISTRATION, WITH THIS

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:25.433
LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP, THERE'S

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.501
BEEN A LOT OF YEARS THAT WE'RE

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.403
DIGGING OUT FROM IN DECADES

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:29.637
BEFORE THAT. AND SO WE'VE GOT

01:28:29.704 --> 01:28:31.606
TO CONTINUE TO INVEST, NO

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:32.507
MATTER THE HEADWINDS THAT ARE

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:35.009
AGAINST US RIGHT NOW. I'M GOING

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:36.844
TO PLUS ONE TO ALL OF THOSE

01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:38.579
REMARKS. AND I GUESS THE THINGS

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:41.349
THAT I WOULD ADD, FIRST OF ALL,

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.717
I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:44.819
I THINK IT IS A ECONOMISTS

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.320
OFTEN REFER TO THIS AS A BROKEN

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:47.588
MARKET MORE BROADLY. SO I DON'T

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:49.190
THINK THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:50.758
UNIQUE TO THE SUBSIDY SYSTEM,

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:51.592
BUT ARE RATHER LARGER PROBLEMS

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.461
IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY AND FOR

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.363
THE ENTIRETY OF THE CHILD CARE

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:56.798
FIELD. SO I THINK THAT'S WORTH

01:28:56.864 --> 01:28:58.566
ACKNOWLEDGING. AND THEN I ALSO

01:28:58.633 --> 01:28:59.233
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.501
MILESTONE OF HAVING ACHIEVED

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:01.669
THE ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:03.237
FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:04.472
FOLLOWING IN DETAIL. I'LL JUST

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:06.541
SAY IN SIMPLE TERMS THAT THE

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:08.710
WAY THAT WE SET RATES FOR CHILD

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.778
CARE WITHIN THE SUBSIDY SYSTEM

01:29:10.845 --> 01:29:11.713
FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:12.914
IN PARTICULAR, HAS HISTORICALLY

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.616
BEEN BASED ON PAYING A PORTION

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.685
OF WHAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR.

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:19.520
WE SURVEY PROVIDERS, WHAT DO

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:21.255
YOU CHARGE? AND THEN WE PAY A

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:23.491
PORTION OF THE MARKET RATE.

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.727
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:28.463
HAVE HAD A STUDY AND TAKEN THE

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:29.864
OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE WHAT'S

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:30.331
CALLED AN ALTERNATIVE

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:32.400
METHODOLOGY, WHICH IS ACTUALLY

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:33.701
TRYING TO ADDRESS WHAT IS THE

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:35.603
COST OF THE CARE THAT'S BEING

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:37.638
PROVIDED, NOT WHAT IS WHAT IS

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:38.906
THE MARKET BEAR, BUT WHAT IS

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:40.908
THE ACTUAL COST. AND WHEN WE

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.310
NOW SET RATES AND AND TELL THE

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.344
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHAT

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:45.346
PROPORTION OF THE COSTS WE ARE

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:46.547
ARE COVERING WITH OUR SUBSIDY

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.149
RATES, IT IS BENCHMARKED

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:48.816
AGAINST THAT ALTERNATIVE

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:51.586
METHODOLOGY, COST OF CARE. SO

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:53.387
WHILE THAT DOESN'T IN AND OF

01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:55.523
ITSELF SOLVE ANYTHING ABOUT THE

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.758
GAP, WE'VE MADE INVESTMENTS

01:29:56.824 --> 01:29:58.526
THAT ARE WORKING ON THAT GAP,

01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:00.328
IT DOES AT LEAST PROVIDE US

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:02.497
VISIBILITY TO HAVE A MORE

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:03.464
MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION THAN

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.299
WE'VE REALLY EVER BEEN ABLE TO

01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:06.667
HAVE BEFORE. ABOUT HOW TO

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:08.436
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. CAN I

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:09.771
ALSO ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION?

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:11.305
THE COST OF CARE IS IT? IT

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:12.707
VARIES, I'M ASSUMING, DEPENDING

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.375
WHETHER YOU'RE IN SACRAMENTO OR

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:17.512
LA OR WHATNOT. AND THEN DOES

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:19.747
THAT COST OF CARE? ALSO TAKE A

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:20.481
LOOK AT THE CURRICULUM OR EACH

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:22.550
CENTER. LIKE HOW DO YOU OR IS

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:24.552
IT JUST A IS IT JUST EQUAL ALL

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.120
ACROSS THE BOARD? BECAUSE EVERY

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:27.488
CENTER IS DIFFERENT, RIGHT?

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:28.356
EVERY HOME BASED CENTER OFFERS

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:29.791
DIFFERENT THINGS OR DOES

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:33.194
DIFFERENT THINGS OR AND THEN IF

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.529
YOU ARE PROVIDING CARE TO A

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.631
CHILD WHO IS GLUTEN FREE, WHO'S

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:37.398
ALLERGIC TO PEANUT, WHO'S I

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:38.633
MEAN, YOU'RE TALKING YOU'RE

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:40.601
GOING TO HAVE TO BUY CERTAIN

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:41.736
SPECIFIC THINGS FOR THIS CHILD,

01:30:41.803 --> 01:30:44.071
WHICH CAN COST MORE MONEY. SO

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:45.573
DO WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.541
THAT AS WELL TOO? I DON'T KNOW

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:48.376
THAT WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

01:30:48.442 --> 01:30:50.244
EVERY FACTOR YOU JUST DESCRIBED,

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.279
BUT I WILL SAY THERE ARE A LOT

01:30:51.345 --> 01:30:53.447
OF FACTORS. SO WHAT WE HAVE ARE

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:54.682
ACTUAL FACTORS AND THEN

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:56.284
SELECTION POINTS WITHIN THEM,

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:57.585
WHICH IS LIKE THE SALARY AND

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:58.853
THEN A SELECTION POINT TO

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.655
IDENTIFY WHAT CONSTITUTES A

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:02.456
LIVING WAGE THAT IS BROKEN DOWN

01:31:02.523 --> 01:31:03.658
REGIONALLY, AND IT'S BROKEN

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.259
DOWN ON A PER CHILD BASIS, AND

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:06.527
DOES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A NUMBER

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:07.662
OF FACTORS THAT YOU'RE

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.664
DESCRIBING. SO IT IS THERE IS

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.465
GREAT VARIATION THAT IS

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:13.267
ACCOUNTED FOR. WHAT ULTIMATELY

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:15.536
WILL HAPPEN IS THAT WE WILL USE

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.572
THAT COST OF CARE TO THEN SET

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:18.539
RATES. AND THOSE RATES MAY BE

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:19.574
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.976
DESCRIBED IN THE COST OF CARE.

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:24.478
SO IT'S IT'S A ONE METHOD OF

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:25.713
MEASURING, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.515
A NUMBER OF THOSE FACTORS. WHAT

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.750
IS THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE.

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:31.385
AND THEN SEPARATELY WE WILL

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:32.820
HAVE A CONVERSATION SAYING IN

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.589
LIGHT OF THAT, HOW DO WE WANT

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:36.357
TO PAY RATES? BUT I DO THINK

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:37.558
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:38.626
DIRECTOR LIFTED UP IS THOSE

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.728
VARIABLES. RIGHT. AND SO, FOR

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:42.530
EXAMPLE, WHAT IS THE FOOD

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:43.731
VARIABLE? I'M NOT SURE THERE'S

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:45.333
A FOOD, BUT IF THERE IS LIKE

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:46.534
THERE'S A LOT OF SURVEYING

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:48.536
THAT'S DONE. BUT THEN THERE ARE

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:49.437
ALSO CHOICES TO MAKE, RIGHT.

01:31:49.503 --> 01:31:52.473
LIKE ARE WE GOING TO CHOOSE A

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.208
VARIABLE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR SOME

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:56.444
OF THOSE COMPLEXITIES THAT

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:58.212
CHILDREN HAVE? SAME THING WHEN

01:31:58.279 --> 01:32:00.448
IT COMES TO SALARY, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:02.950
ARE WE GOING TO CHOOSE A

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:04.819
VARIABLE THAT IS REFLECTS THE

01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:07.521
CURRENT MARKET ABOUT $20 AN

01:32:07.588 --> 01:32:10.458
HOUR OR $22 AN HOUR? OR ARE WE

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:12.193
GOING TO LOOK AT A LIVING WAGE

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.461
SALARY THAT WILL ALLOW A

01:32:13.527 --> 01:32:15.563
PROVIDER TO SUPPORT HER AND HER

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:17.632
FAMILY, OR ARE WE GOING TO LOOK

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:18.499
SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN? AND SO

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:19.700
THERE ARE CHOICES THAT NEED TO

01:32:19.767 --> 01:32:21.402
BE MADE THAT REFLECT NOT JUST

01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:23.371
ALL THE DATA THAT'S BEEN

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:24.605
COLLECTED THROUGH WHAT JEN IS

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:27.341
DESCRIBING, BUT ALSO REFLECT

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:29.410
WHAT PEOPLE'S LIVED EXPERIENCES

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:31.712
AND WHAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.614
TO THRIVE. OKAY,

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:34.916
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS.

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:37.485
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S COLLINS, THANK

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:39.453
YOU. I JUST WANTED TO PIGGYBACK

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.789
OFF FROM WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IS

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:42.890
TALKING ABOUT. SO YOU'RE

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.959
TALKING ABOUT THE VARIATIONS,

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:45.559
WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING AND,

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:47.361
AND HOW THAT'S DEALING WITH THE

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.163
ACTUAL COST OF CARE. AND THEN

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.498
RATES ARE SET. SO HOW ARE WE

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:52.600
UTILIZING THE SLIDING SCALE? I

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:54.335
MEAN, ARE WE ARE WE DOING THAT

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:55.469
BECAUSE I'M ASKING THIS

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:57.004
QUESTION BECAUSE IF I GO BACK

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:58.406
SOME YEARS AGO, THIS WAS WHEN

01:32:58.472 --> 01:33:00.775
OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, SHIRLEY

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:01.776
WEBER, WAS IN OFFICE AND WE

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:02.677
WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:04.879
ABOUT THE CHILD CARE AND

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:05.579
MILITARY FAMILIES AND ALL OF

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:06.514
THAT STUFF. AND I REMEMBER

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:07.581
WORKING WITH EDUCATIONAL

01:33:07.648 --> 01:33:08.616
ENRICHMENT SYSTEMS AND WORKING

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:10.518
ON A SLIDING SCALE THAT WAS

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:11.619
THAT WAS GOING TO BE UTILIZED.

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:13.654
SO HAVE ANYONE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:14.822
SLIDING SCALE TO ASSIST

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:17.425
FAMILIES WITH WITH THEM BEING

01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:18.659
ELIGIBLE? THAT'S JUST PART ONE.

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:21.495
I HAVE ANOTHER PART. SO I'M NOT

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:23.297
EXACTLY SURE BY SLIDING SCALE,

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:24.498
IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:25.766
FAMILY FEES THAT FAMILIES PAY

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:28.669
OR IF YOU. YEAH. OKAY. SO IN 23,

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:29.770
24, THE GOVERNOR AND THE

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:31.505
LEGISLATURE INVESTED A LITTLE

01:33:31.572 --> 01:33:32.673
OVER $50 MILLION TO ADDRESS

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:33.941
FAMILY FEES AND MAKE SOME

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.476
REALLY SIGNIFICANT REFORMS. SO

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:37.445
AS IT IS NOW UNDER THE FAMILY

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:39.814
FEE SCHEDULE, THE FEES ARE

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.015
LIMITED TO 1% OF FAMILIES

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:43.417
MONTHLY INCOME, AND THERE'S NO

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:44.719
FEE ASSESSMENT FOR FAMILIES

01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:46.787
WHOSE INCOMES ARE BELOW 75% OF

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:48.789
THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME. SO WE

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.958
HAVE MADE HUGE STRIDES IN THAT

01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:51.859
CONVERSATION IN THE LAST COUPLE

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:55.529
OF YEARS. SO EVEN THOUGH WE'VE

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:57.398
MADE SOME STRIDES, THERE ARE A

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.100
LOT OF FAMILIES WHO STILL THEY

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:00.267
DON'T QUALIFY, QUALIFY FOR

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:02.470
SUBSIDIZED CARE, BUT ALSO

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:03.671
BECAUSE THEY MAKE TOO MUCH. BUT

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:05.773
THEN SOME OF THEM, THEY MAKE

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.241
TOO LITTLE TO AFFORD THE

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:08.009
UNSUBSIDIZED CARE. THERE IS

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:09.510
DEFINITELY AN ISSUE WITH THE

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:11.012
FAMILIES WHO ARE STILL

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:12.713
STRUGGLING TO AFFORD CHILD CARE,

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.281
BUT DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:15.783
SUBSIDY BECAUSE CHILD CARE IS

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.952
SO EXPENSIVE AND LIVING IN

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:19.387
CALIFORNIA IS SO EXPENSIVE. SO

01:34:19.453 --> 01:34:20.721
DEFINITELY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:23.257
THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE THAT

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:24.892
EVEN AMONG THOSE WHO QUALIFY,

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:27.628
WE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT SLOTS.

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:28.462
IT'S A CAPPED PROGRAM. THE

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:29.597
SUBSIDY PROGRAMS ARE CAPPED,

01:34:29.663 --> 01:34:31.966
AND SO WE ARE ABLE TO SERVE

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:33.367
THOSE WE HAVE FUNDING FOR. WE

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.435
HAVE MASSIVELY EXPANDED THE

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:35.703
NUMBER OF SUBSIDIES IN RECENT

01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:37.638
YEARS, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEET

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:39.707
THE FULL NEED. SO I ACKNOWLEDGE

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.342
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS IS AN

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:43.511
ISSUE. SO THEN WHAT HELP, IF

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:44.612
ANY, IS AVAILABLE TO THESE

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:46.614
MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES? I'M

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:47.748
ASKING THAT BECAUSE I FELL IN

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:49.517
THAT CATEGORY. I MEAN LUCKILY

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:52.820
HE'S HE'S 15 NOW. BUT BUT AT

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:54.522
THAT TIME AND THIS IS WHERE AND

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.891
PART OF THE REASON WHY WE ENDED

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:57.892
UP DOING DOING THE LEGISLATION

01:34:57.958 --> 01:34:59.393
WORK THAT WE DID THEN IS

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.429
BECAUSE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE. SO

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.297
WHETHER IT WAS $50 OVER OR WAS

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:04.598
$100 OVER, I JUST I DIDN'T

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:06.500
QUALIFY. LUCKILY I DID FIND

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:08.269
SOMETHING, BUT I WOULD HAVE

01:35:08.335 --> 01:35:10.237
LIKED TO HAD SOME OTHER OPTIONS,

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:12.339
YOU KNOW, MADE AVAILABLE TO ME

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:14.408
BECAUSE I WAS A PART OF THAT

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:16.277
MIDDLE INCOME FAMILY. SO IF

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:16.744
THERE'S ANY HELP, ANY

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:18.446
SUGGESTIONS? YEAH, IT'S A VERY

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:20.548
REAL ISSUE AND ONE THAT I THINK

01:35:20.614 --> 01:35:21.449
WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO ALL TALK

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:23.584
ABOUT AND WORK TO ADDRESS.

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:25.186
THERE ARE SOME RESOURCES IN

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:26.554
TERMS OF JUST NAVIGATION AND

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.721
RESOURCES FOR IDENTIFYING, LIKE

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:29.190
RESOURCE AND REFERRAL TO

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:31.358
FIGURING OUT WHO SERVES AND

01:35:31.425 --> 01:35:32.626
WHERE THEIR SPACES THAT ARE

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:35.763
AVAILABLE. WE HAVE A WEBSITE

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:36.464
THAT ALSO OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:37.665
FOR FAMILIES TO LOCATE

01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:39.433
CHILDCARE AND BE ABLE TO SORT

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.935
OF SEARCH THROUGH AND FIGURE

01:35:41.001 --> 01:35:42.470
OUT WHAT IS THE CHILDCARE THAT

01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:43.370
MIGHT BE AVAILABLE THAT COULD

01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:45.406
MATCH THEIR NEEDS. BUT AGAIN,

01:35:45.473 --> 01:35:46.507
THOSE AFFORDABILITY ISSUES ARE

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:47.741
REAL AND WILL STILL BE THERE

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:49.276
EVEN ONCE YOU FIND A PROVIDER

01:35:49.343 --> 01:35:52.279
WHO MAY MAY ACCEPT THAT CHILD.

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:54.515
AND IF I COULD JUST ADD, IF A

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:55.850
PROVIDER DOES ACCEPT THAT CHILD,

01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:57.718
BUT THE PARENT ISN'T ABLE TO

01:35:57.785 --> 01:35:59.620
PAY AS MUCH AS A SUBSIDY WOULD,

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:00.421
THEN THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:03.390
ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT FURTHER

01:36:03.457 --> 01:36:04.658
ERODES THE PROVIDERS ABILITY TO

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:06.527
CARE FOR EVERYONE. RIGHT? SO

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:08.562
THIS ISN'T JUST, YOU KNOW,

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:09.330
MIDDLE INCOME PROBLEM. IT'S

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:10.931
ALSO THEN IMPACTS SUBSIDY

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:12.333
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SO IT'S

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:13.567
THE WHOLE SYSTEM NEEDS

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.402
INVESTMENT. BUT I JUST WANT TO

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:17.671
SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THESE

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:18.239
THINGS AREN'T HAPPENING IN

01:36:18.305 --> 01:36:19.874
ISOLATION, AND PARTICULARLY

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:22.042
WHEN THERE ARE LIMITED SUBSIDY

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:24.445
DOLLARS. ALSO, IT DOESN'T GIVE

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:26.480
FOLKS A LOT OF ROOM TO BE ABLE

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:27.882
TO SUPPORT THOSE FAMILIES AS

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:29.350
THEY MIGHT WANT TO. THEY CAN'T

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:31.085
PAY THE FULL PRICE. THANK YOU.

01:36:31.152 --> 01:36:32.920
I THINK MY ONE OF MY LAST

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:34.455
POINTS FOR RIGHT NOW IS WHEN

01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:35.789
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.258
THE AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE SLOTS,

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:39.426
AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE DONE

01:36:39.493 --> 01:36:40.628
THAT OVER THE YEARS AND SO

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:42.296
FORTH. I STILL FIND THAT THERE

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:43.531
IS AN ACTUAL DISCONNECT IN A

01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:45.466
SENSE OF OF HOW PEOPLE ARE

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:47.334
BEING INFORMED OF THEIR

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:48.602
ELIGIBILITY TO EVEN GET INTO

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.504
THOSE SLOTS, BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.506
SO MANY TIMES WHERE FOLKS HAVE

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:54.642
COME TO ME, OR EVEN WHEN I WAS

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:55.376
WORKING, YOU KNOW, IN OTHER

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:56.577
DEPARTMENTS AND SO FORTH, WITH

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:58.546
THEM SAYING, OH, I DIDN'T EVEN

01:36:58.612 --> 01:37:00.681
KNOW, YOU KNOW. OR DO I HAVE TO

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.750
APPLY? DO I HAVE TO QUALIFY? DO

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:03.751
I THIS, DO I THAT? SO I'M

01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:05.286
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND CAN YOU

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:06.453
HELP ME UNDERSTAND MY

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.821
COLLEAGUES EVEN FURTHER ON WHY

01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:08.322
THIS IS OCCURRING, THAT

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:09.456
FAMILIES THAT ARE IN NEED CAN'T

01:37:09.523 --> 01:37:11.458
FIND IT, OR THEY'RE NOT WELL

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:12.726
AWARE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:37:12.793 --> 01:37:14.395
EVEN COME INTO THESE, THESE

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:16.397
CHILDCARE SLOTS. BUT ALSO JUST

01:37:16.463 --> 01:37:18.399
WHY IS THERE SUCH A DISCONNECT

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:21.068
IN THIS PART OF IT, OF

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:25.439
ADDRESSING IT? I GUESS WHAT I

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:27.007
WOULD SAY IS THERE IS A COUPLE

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:28.342
OF DIFFERENT TRACKS HERE. SO

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:30.477
WITHIN THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:31.645
THAT IS FALLS UNDER THE

01:37:31.712 --> 01:37:32.413
CALWORKS PROGRAM. SO THE

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:33.714
WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM, CHILD

01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:35.649
CARE IS AN ENTITLEMENT. AND SO

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.851
THE THE GOAL THERE IS THAT THE

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:39.920
CHILD THAT THE WORKER WHO IS

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:40.621
ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THAT

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:41.522
FAMILY ON THEIR CASE PLAN AND

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:43.557
ON THEIR WELFARE TO WORK PLAN,

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:44.758
IS, IS HAVING THOSE

01:37:44.825 --> 01:37:45.326
CONVERSATIONS AND MAKE SURE

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:47.461
THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THAT

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:48.696
ENTITLEMENT. WE DO HEAR FROM

01:37:48.762 --> 01:37:50.698
MANY FAMILIES THAT SAME CONCERN,

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:52.700
THAT THEY ARE INUNDATED WITH A

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.268
LOT OF INFORMATION AS THEY COME

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:55.903
IN THE DOOR. AND THE PROGRAM IS

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:58.405
COMPLEX. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:00.407
OFTEN FOUND THAT IT TAKES

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:01.976
MULTIPLE TIMES AND MULTIPLE

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.577
WAYS OF EXPLAINING AND MULTIPLE

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:06.413
MESSENGERS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.082
IS CLEAR, AND THAT THAT

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:08.616
INFORMATION IS HIGHLIGHTED

01:38:08.682 --> 01:38:10.417
WITHIN THE MIX OF ALL THE

01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:12.219
THINGS THAT ARE COMING AT A

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:13.854
FAMILY. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME

01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:15.456
OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE

01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:17.391
WORK ON WITH THE COUNTIES, ON

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:19.393
THE COMMUNITY BASED SIDE FOR

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.628
THE SUBSIDY SLOTS, FOR THOSE

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:21.495
WHO ARE NOT ENROLLED IN

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:22.529
CALWORKS. AGAIN, IT'S NOT AN

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:24.598
ENTITLEMENT, BUT THERE ARE THE

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:25.499
SLOTS AND AND WAITING LISTS FOR

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:27.901
THOSE WHO MAY NOT CURRENTLY

01:38:27.968 --> 01:38:29.503
HAVE A SLOT BUT DO QUALIFY. AND

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:31.338
I THINK IN A VERY SIMILAR VEIN,

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.740
WE HAVE CONTRACTORS THAT THE

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:33.741
RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:35.342
WHO ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE THAT

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:36.543
INFORMATION, AND WE TRY TO

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:38.512
PROVIDE IT PUBLICLY ON OUR

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:39.780
WEBSITE, BUT WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:41.081
TO THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.683
WE IMPROVE THE FLOW OF THAT

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.585
INFORMATION AND MAKE IT MORE

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:45.486
ACCESSIBLE FOR FAMILIES. IT IS

01:38:45.552 --> 01:38:47.621
A HARD THING TO NAVIGATE, AND

01:38:47.688 --> 01:38:49.790
WE KNOW THAT IN OUR OUR TOTALLY

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:50.724
OPEN TO THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:53.394
HOW TO CONTINUE IMPROVING. I

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:54.728
DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR PARENT

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:56.263
VOICES, BUT I WOULD JUST SAY

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:57.931
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'VE

01:38:57.998 --> 01:38:59.400
LIFTED UP MANY TIMES IS THE

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:00.868
SYSTEM WASN'T NECESSARILY

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:01.402
DESIGNED WITH PARENTS AND

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:03.337
PROVIDERS AT THE TABLE, AND SO

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:05.039
THAT HAS LED TO A SYSTEM THAT

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:06.340
DOESN'T ALWAYS REFLECT, YOU

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:08.809
KNOW, SOME OF THE MOST

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:10.244
STREAMLINED WAYS TO GET ACCESS

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:11.278
TO INFORMATION AND RESOURCES

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:12.513
THAT THEY COULD NEED. THANK YOU.

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:14.148
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY

01:39:14.214 --> 01:39:16.450
MEMBER, PATRICK, THANK YOU GUYS

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:19.219
FOR BEING HERE AND ALL OF YOUR

01:39:19.286 --> 01:39:22.022
INFORMATION. I HAD A COUPLE

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:24.325
QUESTIONS AND I GUESS A COMMENT.

01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:25.959
I WAS ALSO IN THAT MIDDLE

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:27.594
SECTION AND WAS BLESSED TO BE

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.463
ABLE TO STAY HOME FOR TEN YEARS.

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:31.765
AND I WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.734
ON AISHA. WE DIDN'T TALK AFTER,

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:35.836
BUT YOU WILL COMPLETELY GET

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:36.637
HIRED ANYWHERE YOU GO BECAUSE

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:39.673
IT'S STAY AT HOME. MOMS ARE THE

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:40.641
THE ULTIMATE MULTITASKERS AND

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:43.377
SOME OF THE BEST EMPLOYEES AND

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:44.611
COWORKERS I'VE EVER WORKED WITH.

01:39:44.678 --> 01:39:46.847
SO YOU YOU WILL YOU'LL JUST BE

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:48.482
A A LITTLE BIT BEHIND AND A

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:50.517
LITTLE A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:51.819
THE REST OF THEM. I'M STILL

01:39:51.885 --> 01:39:53.354
PLAYING CATCH UP, BUT IT'S

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:56.290
WORKING. BUT THAT THAT MIDDLE

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:58.559
INCOME IS WHERE I THINK A LOT

01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:00.260
OF OUR, MY CONSTITUENTS ARE

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:03.530
STRUGGLING AND WE HAVE JUST A

01:40:03.597 --> 01:40:04.331
NOT ENOUGH SLOTS. SO MY

01:40:04.398 --> 01:40:05.599
QUESTION IS MOSTLY ABOUT THE

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:07.668
SLOTS THAT WERE PROMISED TO

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:09.636
HAPPEN IN THE STATE AND WHY

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:10.404
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING, AND KIND

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:12.740
OF WHERE WE'RE AT THERE AND

01:40:12.806 --> 01:40:14.308
WHEN WE WILL BE OPENING THOSE

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.410
SLOTS UP. YEAH. THANK YOU SO

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:18.479
MUCH. SO WE HAVE DRAMATICALLY

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:19.513
INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:20.714
CHILDREN SERVED THROUGH THE

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:23.384
SUBSIDY SYSTEM. SO IT WAS

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:25.753
294,000 IN 2019 AS I MENTIONED,

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:28.288
AND IS NOW 378,000IN 2024. SO

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:30.023
WE'VE MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS.

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.725
WHAT I WILL ALSO SAY, THOUGH,

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:35.529
IS THAT IT HAS BEEN FASTER TO

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:36.363
BRING THOSE ADDITIONAL SLOTS

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:38.499
ONLINE TO BEING FILLED ON THE

01:40:38.565 --> 01:40:40.768
VOUCHER SIDE THAN IT HAS BEEN

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:43.570
ON THE CENTER BASED SIDE, AND

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:45.506
THAT IS IN PART WHAT IT TAKES

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:46.540
FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THE THE

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:48.575
THINGS THAT IT TAKES TO OPEN A

01:40:48.642 --> 01:40:49.843
CLASSROOM THAT ARE, THAT TAKE

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.512
ADDITIONAL TIME. AND SO THAT

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:53.814
HAS BEEN A PROCESS. WE'VE ALSO

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.983
MADE SOME PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:57.184
ALONG THE WAY. THIS ALL

01:40:57.251 --> 01:40:58.852
HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME THAT

01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:00.754
WE WERE TRANSFERRING PROGRAMS

01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:02.222
FROM CDE TO CDSS. WE HAD ALL

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:04.625
THE MONEY COMING IN RELATED TO

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.527
THE PANDEMIC. THERE WAS A LOT

01:41:06.593 --> 01:41:07.461
GOING ON AND THE PANDEMIC

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:10.464
ITSELF. AND SO ADMITTEDLY,

01:41:10.531 --> 01:41:11.398
THERE WERE SOME PROCESSES THAT

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.367
WE NEEDED TO STREAMLINE ABOUT

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:15.536
HOW WE PUT OUT THE RFP, HOW WE

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:16.703
WORKED WITH OUR CONTRACTORS TO

01:41:16.770 --> 01:41:18.405
MAKE THAT MORE EFFICIENT IN

01:41:18.472 --> 01:41:20.207
TERMS OF DOING THE EXPANSION.

01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:22.376
AND WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:23.544
IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT REGARD. SO,

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:25.245
FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE WHO HAVE

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:26.413
ALREADY BEEN CONTRACTORS CAN GO

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.548
THROUGH A MORE STREAMLINED

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:29.249
PROCESS THAN THOSE WHO ARE

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:30.617
NEWLY COMING IN. SO THOSE

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:31.385
IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN HELPFUL.

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:32.820
THERE IS A CONTINUED COMMITMENT

01:41:32.886 --> 01:41:34.388
TO THE REST OF THE SLOTS. WE

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:36.423
HAD PAUSED THEM DUE TO THE

01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:37.624
STATE'S FISCAL SITUATION AND

01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:39.293
THE TIME THAT IT'S TAKING THOSE

01:41:39.359 --> 01:41:40.627
CENTER BASED CONTRACTORS TO

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:43.564
COME ONLINE FOR A YEAR OR TWO.

01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:45.499
BUT WE THE AGREEMENT WAS THAT

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:47.634
THEY WOULD CONTINUE IN THE OUT

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.403
YEARS. SO THE TIME FRAME GOT

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:50.737
ELONGATED, BUT THE TOTAL NUMBER

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:52.873
OF SLOT COMMITMENTS DIDN'T

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:56.577
CHANGE. SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:58.278
POPULATION GROWTH OR NEED

01:41:58.345 --> 01:41:59.646
BECAUSE JUST THE ECONOMY AS

01:41:59.713 --> 01:42:01.248
WELL, LIKE ONE INCOME

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:03.350
HOUSEHOLDS ARE HARD TO COME BY

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:05.385
NOW. SO I THINK THE NEED HAS

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:07.988
GROWN, BUT OUR OUR NUMBER OF

01:42:08.055 --> 01:42:09.556
SLOTS HAS NOT CAUGHT UP WITH

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:11.291
THAT. SO THAT REALLY CONCERNS

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:14.228
ME. WHAT AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:16.897
CAN WE DO TO HELP MAKE THAT

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:20.400
HAPPEN FASTER? I MEAN, YEAH,

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:21.568
BESIDES MONEY, IT'S ALWAYS

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.437
MONEY, RIGHT? IS THERE ANYTHING

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:24.505
OTHER THAN MONEY? LIKE, SINCE

01:42:24.571 --> 01:42:28.208
WE'RE, YOU KNOW, ALSO BROKE. I

01:42:28.275 --> 01:42:30.377
THINK. I MEAN, FROM WHAT THE

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:31.545
DIRECTOR IS LIFTING UP, SEEMS

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:32.513
LIKE MONEY ON THE VOUCHER SIDE

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:34.648
WOULD BE THE MOST EXPEDIENT.

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:37.751
OKAY, OKAY. THANK YOU. I WANT

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:39.853
TO THANK THANK YOU ALL FOR

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.722
BEING HERE TODAY. I HAVE TWO

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:43.357
THINGS. TWO COMMENTS I JUST

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:45.626
WANT TO MAKE IS THAT YOU TALKED

01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:47.327
ABOUT BRIEFLY ABOUT THE

01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:49.463
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY.

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:52.332
DO WE HAVE A TIMELINE FOR THAT

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:53.734
PROCESS, AND CAN WE MAKE SURE

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.302
THAT WE HAVE PROVIDERS,

01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:56.737
CHILDCARE PROVIDERS AND

01:42:56.803 --> 01:42:57.871
ADVOCATES TO BE INCLUDED IN

LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE IN

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:10.450
SETTING NEW RATES SO WE CAN

01:43:10.517 --> 01:43:11.718
TALK ABOUT THIS OFFLINE, BUT

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:13.253
THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.556
I THINK THE ALTERNATIVE METHOD,

01:43:15.622 --> 01:43:18.325
WE GOT TO NAIL THAT THING DOWN.

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:20.827

WELL GOOD AFTERNOON, ASHLEY

01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:06.500
HOFFMAN, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:07.668
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

01:45:07.734 --> 01:45:09.269
TODAY, REALLY HONORED. OH,

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:10.437
THEY'RE JUST MOVING REALLY

01:45:10.504 --> 01:45:12.539
HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:15.108
TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS

01:45:15.175 --> 01:45:16.510
IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND I'M REALLY

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:18.478
HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW CAN

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:19.646
EMPLOYERS BE PART OF THE

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:21.548
SOLUTION TO IMPROVING ACCESS TO

01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:24.651
CHILD CARE? WE KNOW THAT ACCESS

01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:26.286
TO CHILD CARE BENEFITS BOTH

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:28.522
EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS. THE US

01:45:28.588 --> 01:45:29.890
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS A

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:31.358
FOUNDATION THAT HAS ACTUALLY

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:32.626
DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK AND

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:34.327
ONGOING WORK ABOUT THIS ISSUE,

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:36.930
BECAUSE OF THE GRAVITY OF THE

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:39.166
ISSUE NATIONWIDE, NOT ONLY IN

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:40.333
CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.602
REPORTS BY THE US CHAMBER, UP

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:44.304
TO 40% OF PARENTS HAVE REPORTED

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:45.539
THAT THEY OR SOMEONE ELSE IN

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:46.740
THEIR HOUSEHOLD HAS EITHER LEFT

01:45:46.807 --> 01:45:48.341
A JOB, DECLINED A JOB, OR

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:49.576
CHANGED JOBS BECAUSE OF

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:51.611
PROBLEMS WITH CHILDCARE. IN THE

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:53.480
LAST 12 MONTHS. OF THOSE WHO

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.649
HAVE LEFT THEIR JOB, UP TO 76%

01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:57.284
SAY THAT THEY'VE DONE SO WHEN

01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:58.518
THEIR CHILD WAS TWO OR YOUNGER.

01:45:58.585 --> 01:46:00.487
AND THE CHAMBER IS ACTUALLY IN

01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:01.722
THE PROCESS OF DOING A SERIES

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:02.489
OF REPORTS FOCUSING ON

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:03.590
DIFFERENT STATES. AND ALL OF

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:06.026
THOSE REPORTS ARE SHOWING THAT

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:06.660
STATES ACTUALLY USE HUNDREDS OF

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:07.661
LOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:09.563
DOLLARS TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:10.897
DUE TO WORKFORCE ISSUES

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:11.431
RESULTING FROM A LACK OF

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:12.666
CHILDCARE. AND THAT CHART OVER

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.501
THERE REALLY SHOWS JUST THE

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:15.869
GRAVITY OF THE ABSENTEE ISSUE

01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:17.604
THAT HAPPENS WHEN PARENTS MUST,

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:20.040
UNFORTUNATELY, BE ABSENT FROM

01:46:20.107 --> 01:46:20.640
WORK DUE TO CHILDCARE ISSUES.

01:46:20.707 --> 01:46:22.642
SO WE REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:24.277
TODAY IS WHAT KIND OF BENEFITS

01:46:24.344 --> 01:46:25.512
ARE EMPLOYERS OFFERING RIGHT

01:46:25.579 --> 01:46:27.247
NOW? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

01:46:27.314 --> 01:46:28.348
CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE IN

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:29.416
POTENTIALLY OFFERING MORE

01:46:29.483 --> 01:46:31.852
BENEFITS? AND THEN WHAT ARE

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:32.953
SOME MODELS OF POTENTIAL PUBLIC

01:46:33.019 --> 01:46:34.454
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'VE

01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:36.456
SEEN IN OTHER STATES, BUT THEN

01:46:36.523 --> 01:46:38.225
ALSO LOCALLY THAT THE

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:41.261
LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER? SO I

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:43.396
WAS VERY INTERESTED JUST TO

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:45.599
KNOW WHAT KIND OF BENEFITS DO

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:47.300
OUR MEMBERS OFFER. SO I SENT A

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:48.602
SURVEY OUT TO OUR MEMBERS. WE

01:46:48.668 --> 01:46:52.272
HAD ABOUT 225 WHO DID RESPOND.

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:53.507
I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THAT

01:46:53.573 --> 01:46:55.475
ACTUALLY, ABOUT HALF OF THOSE

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:55.942
RESPONDENTS WERE SMALL

01:46:56.009 --> 01:46:57.377
BUSINESSES. SO SMALL BUSINESSES

01:46:57.444 --> 01:46:59.379
WITH FEWER THAN 50 EMPLOYEES

01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:00.480
AND SOME OF THE RESPONDENTS

01:47:00.547 --> 01:47:01.615
THEMSELVES WERE ACTUALLY

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:04.184
CHILDCARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE OUR

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:06.386
MEMBERS. SO ABOUT 30% OF THE

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:07.687
RESPONDENTS DO OFFER SOME

01:47:07.754 --> 01:47:09.556
BENEFIT RELATED TO CHILDCARE.

01:47:09.623 --> 01:47:11.758
AND EXAMPLES OF THAT CAN

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:12.559
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE PTO OR

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.494
LEAVE SPECIFIC TO CHILD CARE.

01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:17.097
FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT FOR

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:18.331
DEPENDENT CARE. SOME DO OFFER

01:47:18.398 --> 01:47:21.768
ON SITE OR NEAR SITE CARE. SOME

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:23.670
EMPLOYERS RESPONDED THAT THEY

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:24.404
ACTUALLY ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:26.540
BRING CHILDREN INTO THE OFFICE.

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:28.408
SOME DO ONLY UP TO A CERTAIN

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:30.110
AGE, AND THEN OTHERS ALLOWED

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:31.711
FOR ALL CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO

01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:33.446
BE BROUGHT INTO THE OFFICE.

01:47:33.513 --> 01:47:34.614
SOME THAT WERE CHILDCARE

01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:35.682
PROVIDERS SAY THAT THEY OFFER

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:37.317
DISCOUNTS, OF COURSE, TO THEIR

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:38.518
OWN EMPLOYEES FOR USING THEIR

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:40.287
SERVICES. AND THEN A LOT OF

01:47:40.353 --> 01:47:41.721
PEOPLE RESPONDED THAT THEY ALSO

01:47:41.788 --> 01:47:43.690
OFFER FLEXIBILITY, YOU KNOW, TO

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:44.791
WORK AT HOME IF NECESSARY,

01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:46.493
WHICH CAN HELP ALLEVIATE. BUT I

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.228
THINK ONE OF THE REALLY BIG

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:49.496
TAKEAWAYS THAT I HAD FROM THE

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:51.431
SURVEY, WHICH I INTENTIONALLY

01:47:51.498 --> 01:47:52.732
LEFT OPEN JUST FOR PEOPLE TO

01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:54.267
WRITE IN COMMENTS BECAUSE I WAS

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:55.669
VERY CURIOUS FOR JUST ANECDOTAL

01:47:55.735 --> 01:47:57.637
RESPONSES FROM OUR MEMBERS, WAS

01:47:57.704 --> 01:47:59.272
THAT THERE'S REALLY NO ONE SIZE

01:47:59.339 --> 01:48:01.441
FITS ALL KIND OF BENEFIT. YOU

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:02.609
KNOW, EVERY WORKPLACE AND EVERY

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:04.711
REALLY SET OF EMPLOYEES HAVE

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:06.813
VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS. YOU KNOW,

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.281
SOME OF THE RESPONSES I GOT

01:48:08.348 --> 01:48:09.516
WERE, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY DO

01:48:09.583 --> 01:48:10.617
OFFER BENEFITS AND THEIR

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:12.185
EMPLOYEES LOVE IT. OTHERS WERE

01:48:12.252 --> 01:48:13.353
THAT, YOU KNOW, INSTEAD, OUR

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:14.554
EMPLOYEES HAVE SAID THAT THEY

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:15.789
WOULD PREFER, YOU KNOW, BETTER

01:48:15.856 --> 01:48:17.290
HEALTH CARE BENEFITS OR OTHER

01:48:17.357 --> 01:48:18.525
KINDS OF BENEFITS. SO REALLY

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:21.161
SHOWING THAT IT REALLY IS KIND

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:22.128
OF A WORKPLACE BY WORKPLACE

01:48:22.195 --> 01:48:26.399
SITUATION. OF THOSE THAT DO

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:28.568
OFFER BENEFIT, ABOUT 60% SAID

01:48:28.635 --> 01:48:30.871
THAT THEY DO BELIEVE THAT

01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:32.439
IMPROVES EMPLOYEE RETENTION. I

01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:33.540
DID INCLUDE A FEW QUOTES THAT

01:48:33.607 --> 01:48:35.342
WE GOT DIRECTLY, WHICH WAS THAT,

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:37.410
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE HAD REALLY

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:38.378
DIRECT FEEDBACK FROM EMPLOYEES

01:48:38.445 --> 01:48:40.347
THAT SHOW THAT THEIR CHILDCARE

01:48:40.413 --> 01:48:42.816
SUBSIDY HELPS, THAT THEY CAN

01:48:42.883 --> 01:48:44.184
WORK FULL TIME, AND ABSOLUTELY

01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:45.285
HELPS WITH RETENTION AND

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:47.454
EMPLOYEE LOYALTY OVER TIME. IT

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.722
IS A FREQUENT TOPIC OF

01:48:48.788 --> 01:48:52.425
DISCUSSION AMONG EMPLOYEES AND AND SOME

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:54.628
FOLKS SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, WE

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:55.495
STARTED OFFERING THIS DURING

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:57.530
NICK, OF COURSE, BECAUSE OF THE

01:48:57.597 --> 01:48:58.698
IMPACT THAT THAT HAD ON THE

01:48:58.765 --> 01:48:59.633
LABOR FORCE AND ON CHILDCARE

01:48:59.699 --> 01:49:01.568
PROVIDERS, AND THAT WE'VE

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:04.204
ACTUALLY CONTINUED THOSE

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:05.071
BENEFITS JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:08.308
SUCH A SUCCESS. AND THEN, OF

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:10.377
COURSE, THERE'S YOU KNOW, I

01:49:10.443 --> 01:49:11.478
ASKED ABOUT CHALLENGES TO

01:49:11.544 --> 01:49:12.646
PROVIDING BENEFITS. AND OF

01:49:12.712 --> 01:49:14.414
COURSE, COST COMES UP, RIGHT?

01:49:14.481 --> 01:49:16.850
ESPECIALLY FOR SOME SMALL

01:49:16.917 --> 01:49:17.484
BUSINESSES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:19.819
FOR THEM, RIGHT, TO KIND OF

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:21.021
AFFORD ABOVE AND BEYOND TO

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:23.356
PROVIDE SOME OF THESE. BUT

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:25.191
COSTS, YOU KNOW, ALSO CAME UP

01:49:25.258 --> 01:49:25.792
IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

01:49:25.859 --> 01:49:27.727
CONSIDERATIONS. SOME OF IT, YES,

01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:29.529
IS BUSINESS SIZE. BUT THEN

01:49:29.596 --> 01:49:31.731
OTHER THINGS WERE, YOU KNOW,

01:49:31.798 --> 01:49:32.632
FOR THOSE WHO WERE CONSIDERING

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:34.467
THINGS LIKE ON SITE OR NEAR

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:35.568
SITE CARE, YOU KNOW, IT'S

01:49:35.635 --> 01:49:36.569
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE COST

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.471
OF A NEW CHILDCARE FACILITY,

01:49:38.538 --> 01:49:40.206
ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM HHS,

01:49:40.273 --> 01:49:41.508
HAS ACTUALLY TRIPLED FROM WHAT

01:49:41.574 --> 01:49:43.576
IT WAS JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

01:49:43.643 --> 01:49:46.012
AND SO FOR THOSE LOOKING AT

01:49:46.079 --> 01:49:46.646
SOME OF THESE BIGGER SOLUTIONS,

01:49:46.713 --> 01:49:47.781
MAYBE IT'S PARTNERING WITH

01:49:47.847 --> 01:49:49.282
OTHER EMPLOYERS TO OFFER NEAR

01:49:49.349 --> 01:49:50.450
SITE CARE OR SOMETHING OF THAT

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:53.053
NATURE THAT JUST THE COST AND

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:53.720
THE REGULATION AND THE

01:49:53.787 --> 01:49:55.455
PERMITTING TO BUILD THESE KINDS

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:58.224
OF FACILITIES IS VERY DIFFICULT.

01:49:58.291 --> 01:49:59.960
AGAIN, YOU KNOW, REQUIRING

01:50:00.026 --> 01:50:01.428
CONSISTENT USE. AND ENROLLMENT

01:50:01.494 --> 01:50:02.696
WAS ANOTHER THEME THAT WE

01:50:02.762 --> 01:50:03.596
REALLY SAW FROM OUR MEMBERS

01:50:03.663 --> 01:50:06.766
THAT WE WERE TALKING TO, AGAIN,

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:08.335
SOME THAT USED TO OFFER THOSE

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:09.536
KIND OF BENEFITS. ONCE

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:11.137
EMPLOYEES WHO HAD UTILIZED

01:50:11.204 --> 01:50:11.705
THOSE BENEFITS, MAYBE THEIR

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:12.472
CHILDREN GREW OR THOSE

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:13.673
EMPLOYEES NO LONGER WORKED

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.608
THERE. THERE WAS A LOT OF EBB

01:50:15.675 --> 01:50:17.310
AND FLOW IN THE USE, ESPECIALLY

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:18.478
WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:20.080
OFFERING MAYBE SUBSIDIES OR

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:22.415
CONTRACTS OR CONSIDERATIONS FOR

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:25.785
OFF SITE CARE AND THEN WORKING

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:27.387
REMOTELY. RIGHT. OF COURSE,

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:28.521
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

01:50:28.588 --> 01:50:30.123
LIKE TO OFFER, ESPECIALLY TO

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:31.758
HELP WITH CHILDCARE, BUT THAT'S

01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:32.592
NOT NECESSARILY DOABLE, RIGHT?

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:34.294
FOR EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYER, FOR

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.428
AN EMPLOYER LIKE AGAR

01:50:35.495 --> 01:50:36.629
CONSTRUCTION, YOU'RE GOING

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:38.264
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:39.332
OFFER MAYBE REMOTE WORK THE

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:41.001
SAME THAT YOU COULD FOR SOMEONE

01:50:41.067 --> 01:50:42.502
WHO'S MORE IN AN OFFICE, AN

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:44.637
OFFICE JOB. SO THESE WERE JUST

01:50:44.704 --> 01:50:45.605
A COUPLE OF THE CHALLENGES I

01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:47.540
WANTED TO RAISE, JUST TO KIND

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:48.375
OF SHOW WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE

01:50:48.441 --> 01:50:49.609
THINKING THROUGH. I ALSO HAD A

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:51.611
LOT OF RESPONDENTS THAT SAID, I

01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:53.313
REALLY WISH I COULD OFFER THIS,

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:55.148
OR THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:55.715
STARTED TO OFFER IT BECAUSE

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:57.283
SOMEONE IN THEIR ORGANIZATION,

01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:59.486
WHETHER IT BE THE HR

01:50:59.552 --> 01:51:00.520
REPRESENTATIVE OR MAYBE THE

01:51:00.587 --> 01:51:01.488
LEADER OF THE THE COMPANY, YOU

01:51:01.554 --> 01:51:03.757
KNOW, THEY WERE A WORKING

01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:05.392
PARENT THEMSELVES. AND THIS HAS

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:06.826
ALL OF A SUDDEN KIND OF COME TO

01:51:06.893 --> 01:51:10.263
THE FOREFRONT. SO ONE OF THE

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.365
THE KIND OF THINGS TO FOR THE

01:51:12.432 --> 01:51:13.566
LEGISLATURE, I THINK, TO

01:51:13.633 --> 01:51:14.734
CONSIDER WOULD BE, YOU KNOW,

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:16.469
LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF A PUBLIC

01:51:16.536 --> 01:51:17.704
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, CALIFORNIA

01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:18.772
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

01:51:18.838 --> 01:51:19.572
MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:22.475
AND CARE DID INCLUDE IN THEIR

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:23.610
KNOWLEDGE BRIEF. YOU KNOW, THAT

01:51:23.676 --> 01:51:25.645
ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:27.647
TO HELP EXPAND ACCESS IS TO

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:28.915
ENCOURAGE PARTNERSHIPS AMONG

01:51:28.982 --> 01:51:30.383
LARGE AND SMALL EMPLOYERS,

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:31.484
GOVERNMENT, EDUCATIONAL

01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:32.752
INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS

01:51:32.819 --> 01:51:35.522
SUCH AS CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE,

01:51:35.588 --> 01:51:38.124
TO HELP BRING PARTIES TOGETHER

01:51:38.191 --> 01:51:40.026
ABOUT HOW CAN WE HELP ADDRESS

01:51:40.093 --> 01:51:43.696
THIS ISSUE. SO ACTUALLY,

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:45.565
EARLIER THIS YEAR HAD BEEN

01:51:45.632 --> 01:51:47.333
LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE JUST

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.601
SEPARATELY ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:51.404
WHAT DO OTHER STATES DO TO HELP

01:51:51.471 --> 01:51:53.573
TRY AND BRING EMPLOYERS INTO

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.808
SOME OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND

01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:56.509
THE ACCESSIBILITY OF CHILDCARE.

01:51:56.576 --> 01:51:58.611
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, MICHIGAN

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:00.280
STARTED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO,

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:01.614
A PILOT PROGRAM THAT HAS TURNED

01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:03.983
INTO A BROADER PROGRAM CALLED

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:05.452
TRICARE. SO THE THEORY HERE IS

01:52:05.518 --> 01:52:07.687
THAT THE EMPLOYER, THE EMPLOYEE

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:09.355
AND THE STATE SHARE THE COST OF

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:11.624
CHILDCARE. WHAT THEY DO IS THEY

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:13.560
CONTRACT WITH NONPROFITS THAT

01:52:13.626 --> 01:52:15.762
SERVE AS REGIONAL HUBS THAT

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:17.931
HELP CONNECT EMPLOYEES WITH

01:52:17.997 --> 01:52:18.731
PROVIDERS. SO EFFECTIVELY, THE

01:52:18.798 --> 01:52:20.500
EMPLOYER WILL PUT IN, YOU KNOW,

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:22.202
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY, THE

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:23.837
STATE WILL PUT IN A CERTAIN

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:25.472
AMOUNT OF MONEY, AND THEN THAT

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:26.606
NONPROFIT WILL WORK DIRECTLY

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:27.474
WITH THE EMPLOYEES TO HELP HELP

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:28.975
THEM CHOOSE THE PROVIDER THAT

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:30.743
THEY WISH, AND HELP CONNECT

01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:33.146
THEM AND PROVIDE THE PAYMENT

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:34.481
THEN TO THAT PROVIDER. I THINK

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:35.582
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GREAT

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:36.449
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS IT REALLY

01:52:36.516 --> 01:52:38.384
EMPHASIZES PARENT CHOICE, RIGHT?

01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:39.819
IT'S NOT UP TO THE EMPLOYER WHO

01:52:39.886 --> 01:52:41.421
THE PROVIDER IS. IT'S UP TO THE

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:42.522
EMPLOYEE THEMSELVES. AND THEY

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:44.824
DO ALSO CURB ELIGIBILITY BASED

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:46.659
ON INCOME. OF COURSE, I THINK

01:52:46.726 --> 01:52:48.595
ONE OF THE COMMON THEMES THAT

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:49.496
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER

01:52:49.562 --> 01:52:51.431
THIS YEAR, WHEN WE WERE TALKING

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:52.599
ABOUT THESE MODELS IS EXACTLY

01:52:52.665 --> 01:52:53.700
WHAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP, WHICH

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:55.835
IS HOW DO YOU REACH THAT MIDDLE

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:56.936
GROUP, YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU

01:52:57.003 --> 01:52:58.338
REACH THAT GROUP THAT MAY NOT

01:52:58.404 --> 01:52:59.572
QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN ASSISTANCE

01:52:59.639 --> 01:53:01.040
NOW, BUT ALSO DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:02.542
MEANS TO MAYBE AFFORD CHILDCARE,

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:04.377
GIVEN HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS.

01:53:04.444 --> 01:53:06.746
ANOTHER IS ACTUALLY KENTUCKY.

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:10.550
SO THE KENTUCKY REALLY WAS

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:11.484
INTERESTED IN THIS BECAUSE THEY

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:12.485
ACTUALLY HAD THE LOWEST

01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:14.420
WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION RATE IN

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:15.688
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, AND THEY

01:53:15.755 --> 01:53:17.757
FOUND THAT A LOT OF THAT WAS

01:53:17.824 --> 01:53:19.926
DUE TO CHILDCARE ISSUES. SO

01:53:19.993 --> 01:53:20.860
THEY DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE

01:53:20.927 --> 01:53:23.496
AN EMPLOYER WHO DECIDES TO THEY

01:53:23.563 --> 01:53:24.697
WANT TO CONTRIBUTE A CERTAIN

01:53:24.764 --> 01:53:26.533
AMOUNT TO CHILDCARE BASICALLY

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:28.468
APPLIES FOR SOME SORT OF MATCH

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:30.103
FROM THE STATE, AND THE STATE

01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:31.371
WILL THEN GRANT APPLICATIONS. A

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:32.605
PREFERENCE IS GIVEN TO SMALLER

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:34.574
BUSINESSES, BUT THEN ALSO AREAS

01:53:34.641 --> 01:53:35.408
THAT ARE CHILDCARE DESERTS, AND

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:40.446
THEY MATCH BETWEEN 50 AND 100%.

01:53:40.513 --> 01:53:42.815
AND SO BE ABLE AND THEN TO BE

01:53:42.882 --> 01:53:43.416
ABLE TO HELP THOSE EMPLOYEES,

01:53:43.483 --> 01:53:44.984
YOU KNOW, AND HELP INCREASE

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:46.452
THEIR WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:48.721
RATE. AND THEN FINALLY, YOU

01:53:48.788 --> 01:53:49.689
KNOW, A LOT OF STATES REALLY

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:51.224
ARE PUTTING TOGETHER KIND OF

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.926
WORKING GROUPS AND ROUNDTABLES,

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:53.393
INCLUDING THE BUSINESS

01:53:53.459 --> 01:53:54.627
COMMUNITY. I DID REALLY WANT TO

01:53:54.694 --> 01:53:56.529
HIGHLIGHT ONE OF MY MEMBER

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:57.363
CHAMBERS, WHICH IS THE SANTA

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:59.566
ROSA METRO CHAMBER. THEY ARE

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:01.367
DOING A LOT OF WORK IN THIS

01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:03.403
SPACE, ESPECIALLY PRE-PANDEMIC.

01:54:03.469 --> 01:54:05.905
THEY WERE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE

01:54:05.972 --> 01:54:06.506
FOR GETTING SOME CHANGES DONE

01:54:06.573 --> 01:54:09.242
TO SOME LOCAL REGULATIONS ABOUT

01:54:09.309 --> 01:54:10.510
HOW WHAT THE COST OF THESE

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:12.412
FACILITIES WOULD BE AND THE

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:13.680
REQUIREMENTS. THEY ALSO WERE

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:15.648
ABLE TO HELP PULL TOGETHER SOME

01:54:15.715 --> 01:54:16.516
EMPLOYERS TO BASICALLY GO IN

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:18.718
TOGETHER ON A FACILITY. I KNOW

01:54:18.785 --> 01:54:19.986
THEY'VE EXPERIENCED DELAYS DUE

01:54:20.053 --> 01:54:21.421
TO COVID BECAUSE OF THAT OR

01:54:21.487 --> 01:54:23.723
SORRY, BECAUSE OF COVID, BUT

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:26.159
YOU KNOW, JUST REALLY SHOWING

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:26.726
LIKE THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:28.361
WHAT A LOCAL CHAMBER CAN DO,

01:54:28.428 --> 01:54:30.396
ESPECIALLY ON THE LOCAL LEVEL,

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:31.598
HAPPY, VERY HAPPY TO CONNECT

01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:32.899
YOU WITH THEM. IF INTERESTED,

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:35.134
THEY ASKED ME TO TO SAY THAT

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:36.569
THEY'D BE VERY HAPPY TO CHAT

01:54:36.636 --> 01:54:37.637
WITH ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:39.572
WORK THEY'VE BEEN DOING. AND

01:54:39.639 --> 01:54:41.341
THEN FINALLY, I REALLY WANT TO

01:54:41.407 --> 01:54:42.475
ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE SAN DIEGO

01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:44.978
YMCA. THEY ARE A GROUP THAT

01:54:45.044 --> 01:54:45.878
WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS

01:54:45.945 --> 01:54:47.880
WITH. THEY ARE THE CHILDCARE

01:54:47.947 --> 01:54:48.581
RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCY

01:54:48.648 --> 01:54:50.750
FOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY, AND THEN

01:54:50.817 --> 01:54:52.385
PURELY USING FEDERAL AND SOME

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:53.653
STATE FUNDING. THEY WORK WITH

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.488
EMPLOYERS AT NO COST TO THE

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:58.992
EMPLOYER TO DO TWO THINGS ONE,

01:54:59.058 --> 01:54:59.525
ASSESS EMPLOYEES CHILDCARE

01:54:59.592 --> 01:55:00.560
NEEDS, WHICH CAN BE DONE

01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:01.828
THROUGH THINGS LIKE SURVEYING

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:03.563
AND DIRECT CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:05.331
EMPLOYEES. AND THEN THEY ALSO

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:06.599
HELP EMPLOYERS EXPLORE AND

01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:08.201
IMPLEMENT EMPLOYER FUNDED

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:10.703
CHILDCARE BENEFIT PROGRAMS. SO,

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:12.038
FOR EXAMPLE, IF EMPLOYERS ARE

01:55:12.105 --> 01:55:13.172
INTERESTED IN CONTRIBUTING TO

01:55:13.239 --> 01:55:14.507
THE COST OF CHILDCARE, THE

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:15.775
EMPLOYER WOULD PROVIDE A LUMP

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:17.910
SUM TO THE YMCA. AND THE YMCA

01:55:17.977 --> 01:55:19.479
THEN WORKS WITH THE EMPLOYEE

01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:20.680
AND THE PROVIDER DIRECTLY TO

01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:23.383
PAY FOR THAT COST. THE YMCA

01:55:23.449 --> 01:55:25.551
ALSO HELPS PROVIDERS WHO ARE

01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:26.352
THE SMALL BUSINESSES THEMSELVES,

01:55:26.419 --> 01:55:28.655
OF COURSE, TO START OR EXPAND

01:55:28.721 --> 01:55:30.657
THEIR BUSINESSES. AND SO I

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:32.492
THINK I JUST REALLY WANT TO END

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:33.760
BY SAYING, I ABSOLUTELY THINK

01:55:33.826 --> 01:55:35.128
THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR

01:55:35.194 --> 01:55:36.396
EMPLOYERS IN THIS CONVERSATION,

01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:37.630
AND THAT I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:39.599
CONSIDER US AS A PARTNER GOING

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:40.500
FORWARD AS WE ADDRESS THIS

01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:42.535
IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU.

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:43.736
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WILL

01:55:43.803 --> 01:55:45.838
WE BE ABLE TO GET A COPY OF

01:55:45.905 --> 01:55:47.040
YOUR SLIDES? THANK YOU VERY

01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:48.141
MUCH. WE APPRECIATE THAT

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:49.842
BECAUSE OUR HANDWRITING IS NOT

01:55:49.909 --> 01:55:52.612
THAT GOOD. YEAH. NO KIDDING. SO

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:53.446
WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING

01:55:53.513 --> 01:55:55.481
HERE. AND JUST A REAL QUICK I

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:56.683
JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:55:56.749 --> 01:55:57.517
WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:55:57.583 --> 01:55:59.752
STEPHANIE HERE AS WELL AS THE

01:55:59.819 --> 01:56:00.920
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD. AND I

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:03.256
INTRODUCE YOU TWICE BECAUSE I

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:03.823
LIKE HIM TWO TIMES MORE THAN

01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:07.927
THE REST OF THEM. I'M USED TO

01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:10.730
THAT. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON.

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:12.899
MY NAME IS SARAH BOWEN. I'M A

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:14.467
VICE PRESIDENT AT PBIS, THE

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:15.802
PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.370
CALIFORNIA, WHERE I DIRECT OUR

01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:18.738
ECONOMIC POLICY CENTER. THANK

01:56:18.805 --> 01:56:21.274
YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING MY

01:56:21.341 --> 01:56:23.076
TESTIMONY TODAY. I'D LIKE TO

01:56:23.142 --> 01:56:25.211
SHARE SOME FINDINGS FROM PBIS

01:56:25.278 --> 01:56:26.312
RESEARCH, SPECIFICALLY

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:27.547
PERTAINING TO THE ECONOMIC

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:28.748
IMPLICATIONS OF CHILDCARE COSTS

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.583
FOR FAMILIES AND WHAT THAT

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:32.852
MEANS FOR OUR WORKFORCE OVERALL

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:34.053
IN THE STATE. THE AVERAGE

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.489
CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLD SPENDS 73%

01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:38.691
OF THEIR INCOME ON JUST FOUR

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:39.826
MAJOR CATEGORIES FOOD, HOUSING,

01:56:39.892 --> 01:56:41.461
TRANSPORTATION, AND HEALTHCARE.

01:56:41.527 --> 01:56:43.296
SO, AS YOU KNOW, THAT LEAVES

01:56:43.363 --> 01:56:46.132
VERY LITTLE LEFT OVER FOR FOR

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:46.933
CARE RESPONSIBILITIES. AND

01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:48.000
WE'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:49.535
HEARING A LOT OF EXAMPLES AND

01:56:49.602 --> 01:56:50.803
STATISTICS ON HOW COSTLY THAT

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:53.940
IS. OUR STATEWIDE SURVEY. THE

01:56:54.006 --> 01:56:55.808
SURVEY FOUND THAT THOSE

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:57.343
EXPENSES, THE CHILDCARE

01:56:57.410 --> 01:56:58.678
EXPENSES, WEIGH VERY HEAVILY ON

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:02.382
THE MINDS OF PARENTS. SO 13% OF

01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:04.684
PARENTS IN OUR SURVEY RESPONDED

01:57:04.751 --> 01:57:05.952
THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT THE COST

01:57:06.018 --> 01:57:07.920
OF CHILDCARE EVERY DAY OR

01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:09.555
NEARLY EVERY DAY. AND THAT'S

01:57:09.622 --> 01:57:10.857
THAT'S PARENTS WITH SCHOOL AGED

01:57:10.923 --> 01:57:12.625
CHILDREN. I SUSPECT IT WOULD BE

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:14.327
HIGHER IF YOU JUST IF WE WERE

01:57:14.394 --> 01:57:16.429
ABLE TO NARROW IN ON PARENTS OF

01:57:16.496 --> 01:57:18.865
YOUNG CHILDREN. NONETHELESS,

01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:20.433
YOU KNOW, ELIGIBLE FAMILIES, AS

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.567
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING, CAN

01:57:21.634 --> 01:57:23.703
DEFRAY SOME OF THE COST OF CARE

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:25.571
BY ACCESSING SUBSIDIES. BUT

01:57:25.638 --> 01:57:27.440
PARENTS WHO CANNOT ARE PAYING

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.842
OUT OF POCKET FOR A LOT OF

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:31.644
THEIR CARE NEEDS. AND FOR SOME

01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:32.345
FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA, THAT

01:57:32.412 --> 01:57:34.514
ACTUALLY PUTS THEM INTO POVERTY

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:37.083
STATUS. OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:37.984
THAT POVERTY AMONG FAMILIES

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:40.820
WITH PRESCHOOLERS IN PARTICULAR,

01:57:40.887 --> 01:57:43.389
WOULD BE 24% LOWER IF THEY HAD

01:57:43.456 --> 01:57:45.725
ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED CARE. AND

01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:46.893
TO ME, THAT STATISTIC

01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:48.528
DEMONSTRATES JUST HOW CARE

01:57:48.594 --> 01:57:50.129
COSTS MEANINGFULLY IMPACT THE

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:52.532
ECONOMIC STATUS FOR FAMILIES,

01:57:52.598 --> 01:57:54.600
CONSTRAINING THEIR DAY TO DAY

01:57:54.667 --> 01:57:55.735
NEEDS, AS WELL AS HANDLING

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:56.502
EMERGENCY EXPENSES, INVESTING

01:57:56.569 --> 01:57:58.905
IN EDUCATION, INVESTING IN

01:57:58.971 --> 01:58:00.306
STARTING A BUSINESS ALL OF THE

01:58:00.373 --> 01:58:01.841
THINGS THAT HELP FAMILIES BUILD

01:58:01.908 --> 01:58:02.809
THEIR FINANCIAL RESILIENCE AND

01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:05.011
MOBILITY OVER TIME AND

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:05.611
CONTRIBUTE TO THE DYNAMISM OF

01:58:05.678 --> 01:58:07.680
OUR COMMUNITIES. SO THAT'S

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:09.449
REALLY THE FIRST ECONOMIC COST

01:58:09.515 --> 01:58:10.683
THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT,

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:12.485
WHICH IS REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:13.486
COST OF UNAFFORDABLE CARE AND

01:58:13.553 --> 01:58:15.855
HOW THAT IMPACTS FAMILIES AND

01:58:15.922 --> 01:58:16.722
COMMUNITIES. THE SECOND

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:18.491
ECONOMIC IMPLICATION THAT I'D

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:20.426
LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS AROUND HOW

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:21.828
ACCESS TO CARE AFFECTS PARENTS

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:23.396
CHOICES ON WHETHER TO WORK OR

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:25.598
NOT, AND HOW MUCH. OF COURSE,

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:27.266
THOSE ARE COMPLEX PERSONAL

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:29.435
DECISIONS, BUT THE STATISTICS,

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:31.838
IN OUR VIEW, DEMONSTRATE

01:58:31.904 --> 01:58:33.439
BROADER PATTERNS THAT SUGGEST

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:34.640
SYSTEMIC BARRIERS THAT PARENTS

01:58:34.707 --> 01:58:36.809
FACE FACE IN BOTH THE JOB

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:38.444
MARKET AND THE CHILDCARE MARKET.

01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:39.812
SO OUR RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA

01:58:39.879 --> 01:58:41.447
FINDS THAT MOTHERS OF YOUNG

01:58:41.514 --> 01:58:42.782
CHILDREN ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY

01:58:42.849 --> 01:58:44.650
TO WORK THAN FATHERS. THAT IS

01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:46.786
NO SURPRISE, BUT THE GAP IS

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:47.753
HUGE. IT'S 29 POINTS. FATHERS

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.490
OF YOUNG CHILDREN, 95% OF THEM

01:58:50.556 --> 01:58:52.692
ARE WORKING. ABOUT 67% OF

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.727
MOTHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN ARE

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:56.496
WORKING. THAT GAP IS A LITTLE

01:58:56.562 --> 01:58:57.964
BIT SMALLER WHEN BOTH PARENTS

01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:58.865
ARE COLLEGE EDUCATED AND

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:00.500
PROBABLY EARNING MORE OF THE

01:59:00.566 --> 01:59:01.801
RESOURCES TO AFFORD CARE. BUT

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:03.369
THERE'S STILL A GAP THERE,

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:05.505
WHICH I THINK IS ALSO RELATED

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:08.207
TO THE FACTS ABOUT TIME SPENT

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:08.608
ON CARE THAT FALLS

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:10.476
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON WOMEN,

01:59:10.543 --> 01:59:11.777
REGARDLESS OF THEIR EDUCATION,

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:12.512
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE

01:59:12.578 --> 01:59:15.915
WORKING OR NOT. SO WE DID A

01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:16.349
BACK OF THE ENVELOPE

01:59:16.415 --> 01:59:17.884
CALCULATION USING DATA ON THE

01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:19.018
CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CURRENT

01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:20.253
CIRCUMSTANCES OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:59:20.319 --> 01:59:22.388
WOMEN WITH CHILDREN, JUST TO

01:59:22.455 --> 01:59:24.657
GET A BENCHMARK OF HOW HOW WORK

01:59:24.724 --> 01:59:26.926
AND CHILDCARE DECISIONS COULD

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.861
BE DIFFERENT, OR HOW HOW

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:30.229
DIFFERENT DECISIONS ON ON WORK

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:31.531
AND CHILDCARE AMONG WOMEN WOULD

01:59:31.597 --> 01:59:33.566
AFFECT OUR WORKFORCE OVERALL.

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:35.401
SO THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAT

01:59:35.468 --> 01:59:38.271
WE DID IN THE DATA IS TO ASK IF

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:39.539
MOTHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN WERE

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:42.074
AS LIKELY TO WORK AS MOTHERS OF

01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:43.409
OLDER CHILDREN, THOSE WHO ARE

01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:45.845
USING SCHOOL IN A SENSE, AS

01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:46.712
CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. YOU

01:59:46.779 --> 01:59:48.281
KNOW WHAT? HOW MANY ADDITIONAL

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:50.349
MOTHERS COULD BE WORKING? AND

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:51.784
THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT ALL

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:53.352
MOTHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN WOULD

01:59:53.419 --> 01:59:54.520
BE WORKING IN THAT CASE,

01:59:54.587 --> 01:59:55.821
BECAUSE MOST MOTHERS ACTUALLY A

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:57.390
LOT OF MOTHERS THAT DON'T WORK

01:59:57.456 --> 01:59:58.958
REGARDLESS OF THE AGE OF THEIR

01:59:59.025 --> 01:59:59.792
CHILDREN. OUR CALCULATION

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:02.161
SHOWED THAT OVER 80,000 MORE

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:03.996
WOMEN WOULD BE IN THE WORKFORCE

02:00:04.063 --> 02:00:05.631
EVERY YEAR. JUST RUNNING THAT

02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:07.500
THOUGHT EXPERIMENT AROUND KIND

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:09.702
OF ACCESS TO CARE FOR MOTHERS

02:00:09.769 --> 02:00:11.737
OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN IN

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:12.672
CALIFORNIA. AND THOSE RESULTS

02:00:12.738 --> 02:00:14.106
ARE CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL

02:00:14.173 --> 02:00:15.441
RESEARCH THAT SHOWED, IN A

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:18.544
CAUSAL SENSE, THAT INCREASES IN

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:19.912
CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUND

02:00:19.979 --> 02:00:21.847
EXPENDITURES RELATED TO

02:00:21.914 --> 02:00:23.249
INCREASED EMPLOYMENT AMONG LOW

02:00:23.316 --> 02:00:26.786
INCOME MOTHERS. SO, IN ADDITION,

02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:29.789
INCREASING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE

02:00:29.855 --> 02:00:31.724
CARE COULD AFFECT, YOU KNOW,

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:33.426
THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:34.627
CALIFORNIA MOTHERS CHOOSE TO

02:00:34.694 --> 02:00:36.362
WORK. WE'VE BEEN HOLDING FOCUS

02:00:36.429 --> 02:00:37.563
GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE ON A

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:39.665
NUMBER OF TOPICS THIS YEAR, AND

02:00:39.732 --> 02:00:41.434
A MOTHER IN ONE OF OUR GROUPS

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:43.936
IN AROUND THE ISSUE OF ECONOMIC

02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:44.670
SECURITY IN THE BAY AREA,

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:46.505
SHARED THAT MY ISSUE IS, AND

02:00:46.572 --> 02:00:49.208
THIS IS QUOTING HER, I NEED TO

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:50.543
WORK FULL TIME, BUT I CAN'T

02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:53.112
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE CHILDCARE.

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:54.280
I'VE DONE THE NUMBERS. IF I GO

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:55.514
FULL TIME, I'M JUST PAYING

02:00:55.581 --> 02:00:56.816
SOMEONE WITH THAT EXTRA INCOME

02:00:56.882 --> 02:00:58.751
AND IT'S NOT WORTH IT. I THINK

02:00:58.818 --> 02:00:59.986
A VERY COMMON SENTIMENT THAT

02:01:00.052 --> 02:01:01.520
WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM FROM

02:01:01.587 --> 02:01:02.388
OTHERS IN THIS HEARING, BUT

02:01:02.455 --> 02:01:04.457
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A MOTHER

02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:05.625
WHO WOULD LIKE TO WORK FULL

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:06.993
TIME TO ADVANCE ECONOMICALLY,

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:08.828
BUT DOESN'T HAVE A ROUTE TO DO

02:01:08.894 --> 02:01:09.662
THAT BECAUSE OF HER OPTIONS IN

02:01:09.729 --> 02:01:11.764
THE CARE SPACE AND IN, IN THE

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:13.966
JOB SPACE. SO WHILE IT'S A

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:14.734
COMPLETELY RATIONAL AND

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.235
PROBABLY LOVING DECISION FOR

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:18.371
HER FAMILY, THE REALITY IS IN

02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:19.739
OUR LABOR MARKET, THOSE CHOICES

02:01:19.805 --> 02:01:22.308
WILL HAVE LONG TERM IMPACTS ON

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:24.610
HER, HER ABILITY TO EARN. AND

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:26.879
THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN MOTHERS

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:27.513
LEAVE THE WORKFORCE, EITHER BY

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:29.715
WORKING PART TIME OR OR NOT

02:01:29.782 --> 02:01:31.417
WORKING FULL TIME, THEIR

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:32.618
EARNINGS SUFFER IN BOTH THE

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:34.587
NEAR TERM AND THE LONG TERM.

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:36.322
THE GENDER WAGE GAP, WHICH I

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:38.324
KNOW WE'RE ALL FULLY AWARE OF

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:39.759
AND IS WELL DOCUMENTED TO SOME

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:41.494
EXTENT, RISES BECAUSE OF THE

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:43.295
THE WOMEN TAKE MORE TIME OUT OF

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:45.364
THE WORKFORCE, AND THE PENALTY

02:01:45.431 --> 02:01:47.533
TO DOING SO STATISTICALLY IS

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.835
LARGER FOR MOTHERS THAN IT IS

02:01:49.902 --> 02:01:50.603
FOR FATHERS, EVEN FATHERS WHO

02:01:50.670 --> 02:01:52.538
ALSO TAKE TIME OUT OF THE

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:53.472
WORKFORCE. SOME OF THAT IS

02:01:53.539 --> 02:01:55.708
BECAUSE OF WHAT'S JUST EMBEDDED

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.610
IN OUR LABOR MARKET OVER

02:01:57.677 --> 02:01:59.779
DECADES. RIGHT? THE

02:01:59.845 --> 02:02:00.746
INFLEXIBILITY OF JOBS AROUND

02:02:00.813 --> 02:02:02.548
KIND OF THEM NEEDING TO BE

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:04.483
LINEAR, CONTINUOUS, NEEDING TO

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:06.252
WORK LONG HOURS IN ORDER TO

02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:08.554
ACCRUE KIND OF THE GAINS TO

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:11.357
YOUR, TO YOUR WORK. SO I WOULD

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:14.560
SAY, JUST AS A KIND OF SOMEWHAT

02:02:14.627 --> 02:02:15.861
PAINFUL EXAMPLE IS DURING THE

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.430
PANDEMIC, WE SAW HOW JOB

02:02:17.496 --> 02:02:19.965
FLEXIBILITY MATTERED FOR WOMEN,

02:02:20.032 --> 02:02:20.433
IN PARTICULAR, WOMEN'S

02:02:20.499 --> 02:02:25.404
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES SPIKED WORSE THAN MEN IN THE

02:02:25.471 --> 02:02:27.673
FIRST FEW YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC.

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.608
BUT BY THE 22, WOMEN'S

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:30.309
EMPLOYMENT HAD RECOVERED MORE

02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:32.912
QUICKLY THAN IT DID FOR MEN AND

02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:34.280
TO BETTER RATES THAN IT WAS

02:02:34.346 --> 02:02:35.948
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC EVEN

02:02:36.015 --> 02:02:38.584
STARTED. SO THE EVIDENCE ON

02:02:38.651 --> 02:02:40.319
KIND OF THE CAUSES OF THAT ARE

02:02:40.386 --> 02:02:42.521
SOMEWHAT ANECDOTAL, BUT THE

02:02:42.588 --> 02:02:43.622
PATTERNS ARE CONSISTENT WITH

02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:44.490
THE STORIES THAT WE HEARD ABOUT

02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:45.691
INCREASING FLEXIBILITY OF

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:47.526
REMOTE WORK, ALLOWING

02:02:47.593 --> 02:02:49.628
PARTICULARLY MOTHERS TO BALANCE

02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:50.863
CARE RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE

02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:53.332
ABILITY TO WORK. SO I WOULD

02:02:53.399 --> 02:02:54.567
JUST SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IN

02:02:54.633 --> 02:02:55.735
ADDITION TO CONSIDERING THE

02:02:55.801 --> 02:02:58.704
COSTS OF CARE SUBSIDIES AND

02:02:58.771 --> 02:02:59.939
EXPANSIONS IN THAT REALM,

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:01.273
WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS TO GROW

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:04.510
JOBS WITH KINDS OF ASPECTS OF

02:03:04.577 --> 02:03:06.312
FLEXIBILITY THAT HELP MOTHERS

02:03:06.378 --> 02:03:08.013
CHOOSE THE WORK THAT THEY WOULD

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:09.548
LIKE, IS TO THE BENEFIT OF

02:03:09.615 --> 02:03:11.083
THOSE FAMILIES, AS WELL AS TO

02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:12.451
OUR WORKFORCE OVERALL. AND TO

02:03:12.518 --> 02:03:14.720
ME, THIS IS A VERY STRONG

02:03:14.787 --> 02:03:16.255
IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:03:16.322 --> 02:03:18.557
THESE BARRIERS, BECAUSE NOT

02:03:18.624 --> 02:03:19.225
JUST TO INDIVIDUALS AND

02:03:19.291 --> 02:03:21.393
FAMILIES, WHICH IS QUITE CLEAR,

02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:23.329
BUT SO THAT THE STATE CAN MEET

02:03:23.395 --> 02:03:24.530
ITS WORKFORCE AND ECONOMIC

02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:26.866
NEEDS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OUR

02:03:26.932 --> 02:03:28.434
WORKFORCE IS SHRINKING RELATIVE

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:29.435
TO THE POPULATION, BECAUSE THE

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:30.970
BABY BOOM GENERATION IS

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:34.273
REACHING RETIREMENT AGE BY 2050,

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:36.275
WE WILL HAVE THE HIGHEST RATIO

02:03:36.342 --> 02:03:39.011
OF WORKING AGE ADULTS TO

02:03:39.078 --> 02:03:40.846
DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS, BOTH

02:03:40.913 --> 02:03:42.314
YOUNG AND OLD, THAN WE HAVE

02:03:42.381 --> 02:03:45.117
EVER SEEN. SINCE WE HAVE

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:46.318
TRACKED THIS DATA BACK TO 1860.

02:03:46.385 --> 02:03:48.521
SO TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE

02:03:48.587 --> 02:03:49.688
WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED TO GROW

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:51.257
OUR ECONOMY, TO GROW

02:03:51.323 --> 02:03:52.491
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE NEEDS

02:03:52.558 --> 02:03:54.527
OF ALL OF US AS RESIDENTS AND

02:03:54.593 --> 02:03:57.363
THE AGING RESIDENTS, WE NEED TO

02:03:57.429 --> 02:03:58.664
MAXIMIZE THE ABILITY TO WORK

02:03:58.731 --> 02:04:00.366
AMONG THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO

02:04:00.432 --> 02:04:03.636
WANT TO THE EXTENT. SO THE

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:05.337
EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN KIND OF

02:04:05.404 --> 02:04:06.572
OPEN UP PARENTS CHOICES IS THE

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:08.607
WAY THAT I WOULD STATE IT BY

02:04:08.674 --> 02:04:09.508
ADDRESSING BARRIERS IN THE

02:04:09.575 --> 02:04:11.610
CHILDCARE MARKET, IN THE JOB

02:04:11.677 --> 02:04:13.379
MARKET IS TO THE GOOD, TO THEIR

02:04:13.445 --> 02:04:15.748
GOOD OF HAVING CHOICES THAT CAN

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:16.749
MAXIMIZE THEIR OPPORTUNITY, BUT

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:18.384
ALSO FOR THE STRENGTH OF

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:19.351
CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE AND

02:04:19.418 --> 02:04:21.687
OVERALL OUR ECONOMY. THANK YOU.

02:04:21.754 --> 02:04:24.156
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:25.491
BOTH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. IS

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:27.359
THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM ANY IF

02:04:27.426 --> 02:04:29.562
I'LL START WITH ONE THAT I JUST

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:31.797
CAME, I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:33.465
SLIDE REGARDING MICHIGAN AND

02:04:33.532 --> 02:04:36.335
IOWA THAT HAVE PILOTED PUBLIC

02:04:36.402 --> 02:04:37.536
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. DO YOU

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:39.371
HAVE ANY DATA OR HOW LONG HAVE

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:40.573
THEY HAVE THEY BEEN DOING THAT

02:04:40.639 --> 02:04:42.474
AND WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES THAT

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:43.709
THEY MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN SO FAR?

02:04:43.776 --> 02:04:45.377
SO I KNOW MICHIGAN HAS BEEN

02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:47.513
DOING IT FOR A HANDFUL OF YEARS,

02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:48.948
AND THEIR PILOT PROGRAM WAS SO

02:04:49.014 --> 02:04:49.448
SUCCESSFUL THAT THEY'VE

02:04:49.515 --> 02:04:50.516
ACTUALLY STARTED TO EXPAND IT

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:52.818
STATEWIDE. SO VERY HAPPY TO GET

02:04:52.885 --> 02:04:54.053
MORE KIND OF HARD DATA. BUT

02:04:54.119 --> 02:04:55.020
THESE ARE PRETTY RELATIVELY NEW

02:04:55.087 --> 02:04:56.789
PROGRAMS. SO SOME OF THAT DATA

02:04:56.856 --> 02:04:58.457
IS STILL COMING IN. THAT'S GOOD

02:04:58.524 --> 02:05:01.560
TO KNOW. YEAH. WE YOU KNOW, WE

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:02.828
HAVE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX

02:05:02.895 --> 02:05:04.363
HERE PERIODICALLY. I KNOW, I

02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:06.198
KNOW, WE DO A LOT OF GOOD. BUT

02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:07.399
YOU KNOW, ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY

02:05:07.466 --> 02:05:09.435
QUESTIONS. AND JUST A SHOUT OUT

02:05:09.501 --> 02:05:11.637
TO THE YMCA IN SAN DIEGO. THAT

02:05:11.704 --> 02:05:12.471
SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GREAT

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:13.639
PROGRAM. VERY CREATIVE. AND

02:05:13.706 --> 02:05:15.474
I'LL BE SHARING THAT WITH MY

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:16.575
YMCAS AS WELL. SO YEAH, HAPPY

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:18.611
TO CONNECT YOU WITH THEM. AND

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:19.778
THEN SANTA ROSA, THAT WAS

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:21.280
ANOTHER ONE, THE METRO CHAMBER.

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:22.414
METRO CHAMBER. OKAY. THOSE WERE

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:24.583
TWO ONES I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON.

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:26.285
THANKS. YES. CAN YOU WALK ME

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:28.020
THROUGH THE RETURN ON

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:29.221
INVESTMENT THAT CHILDCARE

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:31.624
BRINGS TO OUR LOCAL AND STATE

02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:37.496
LEVEL ECONOMIES? YEAH, I MEAN,

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:38.731
I KNOW, YOU KNOW, I KNOW

02:05:38.797 --> 02:05:40.432
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH

02:05:40.499 --> 02:05:42.568
DONE ON, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:43.402
RETURN ON INVESTMENT. YOU KNOW,

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:45.437
I FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THE

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:46.505
EMPLOYER SIDE, WHICH THERE'S

02:05:46.572 --> 02:05:47.740
PLENTY OF RESEARCH THAT SHOWS

02:05:47.806 --> 02:05:49.008
THAT IF YOU OFFER BENEFITS,

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:50.576
IT'S OVER 100% RETURN ON

02:05:50.643 --> 02:05:51.677
INVESTMENT. AND I THINK, YOU

02:05:51.744 --> 02:05:53.279
KNOW, SOME OF MY SLIDES WERE

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:54.480
TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK

02:05:54.546 --> 02:05:56.181
THE US CHAMBER HAS DONE IS

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:57.349
THEY'RE GOING STATE BY STATE,

02:05:57.416 --> 02:05:58.450
AND THEY'RE ANALYZING WHAT IS

02:05:58.517 --> 02:05:59.718
BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE CALLING

02:05:59.785 --> 02:06:01.654
THE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL, WHICH I

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:02.354
THINK MY COLLEAGUE REFERENCED

02:06:02.421 --> 02:06:04.323
IS HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE WOULD

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:06.225
BE IN THE WORKFORCE, RIGHT, IF

02:06:06.292 --> 02:06:07.426
THEY HAD ACCESS TO CHILDCARE

02:06:07.493 --> 02:06:08.627
AND IN SOME OF THESE STATES.

02:06:08.694 --> 02:06:10.629
AND I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS

02:06:10.696 --> 02:06:11.497
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE IN THIS

02:06:11.563 --> 02:06:13.632
GROUP, BECAUSE WE HAVE LARGE WE

02:06:13.699 --> 02:06:16.869
ARE WE ARE LOSING OVER ABOUT $1

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:18.437
BILLION, RIGHT, OF OF ECONOMIC

02:06:18.504 --> 02:06:20.339
POTENTIAL IN DOLLARS TO THE

02:06:20.406 --> 02:06:22.541
STATE. AND SO I THINK THE

02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:24.276
RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF IF WE

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:25.811
ARE INVESTING IN ENSURING, YOU

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:26.879
KNOW, STABLE CHILDCARE, WE

02:06:26.946 --> 02:06:29.648
WOULD SEE THAT JUST GROW. SO,

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:31.483
YOU KNOW, GROW OUR ECONOMIC

02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:32.718
BENEFIT TO THE STATE. SO MUCH

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:34.553
THAT THAT I FEEL LIKE IT FEELS

02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:36.488
LIKE A NO BRAINER, OF COURSE,

02:06:36.555 --> 02:06:37.823
TO TO INVEST IN CHILDCARE TO

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:38.524
ENSURE THAT OUR WORKFORCE IS,

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.626
IS, YOU KNOW, TAPPING ITS

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:41.794
POTENTIAL. I DON'T KNOW IF

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:44.196
ANYTHING TO ADD, BUT YEAH, ONE

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:45.464
THING AS MANY KNOW, HEATHER AND

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:47.533
I. EXCUSE ME, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:50.069
HARDWICK AND MYSELF ARE FROM

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:51.403
RURAL, RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO I

02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:53.906
GET FRUSTRATED AND I'VE SAID

02:06:53.973 --> 02:06:55.341
THIS BEFORE, IS THAT I DON'T

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:59.545
THINK. WE GATHERED THE DATA

02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:01.580
FROM OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AS

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:03.549
MUCH AS WE SHOULD. YOU KNOW,

02:07:03.615 --> 02:07:05.317
PEOPLE SAY, WELL, WHERE ARE YOU

02:07:05.384 --> 02:07:07.419
FROM? I GO, WELL, I CAN TELL

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:08.721
YOU WHERE I'M NOT FROM

02:07:08.787 --> 02:07:09.588
HOLLYWOOD, LA, SAN DIEGO, SAN

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:10.389
FRANCISCO. THE REST OF THE

02:07:10.456 --> 02:07:12.458
STATE IS OPEN, YOU KNOW, SO I

02:07:12.524 --> 02:07:14.827
JUST WANT TO JUST ENCOURAGE AS

02:07:14.893 --> 02:07:16.562
YOU CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA IS

02:07:16.628 --> 02:07:19.198
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:20.466
RURAL AMERICA. YOU KNOW, WHEN I

02:07:20.532 --> 02:07:22.434
LOOK AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:23.402
RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE STRUGGLING,

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:25.337
SO MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLING.

02:07:25.404 --> 02:07:26.605
AND IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:28.640
IF WE HAD MORE DATA FROM THE

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:30.509
CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL. I THINK

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:32.544
THAT THEY'VE REALLY BEEN TAKING

02:07:32.611 --> 02:07:34.413
IT HARD. I KNOW I WOULD ASSUME

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.982
AND YOU CAN SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:39.418
BUT UP IN SISKIYOU AND BUTTE,

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:41.387
MODOC, ALL, ALL 11 COUNTIES

02:07:41.453 --> 02:07:43.522
THAT SHE HAS, SHE'S GOT THE

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:45.324
BIGGEST AND WE KNOW, WE KNOW

02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:47.393
ACCESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IN

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:48.560
RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE WORD

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:50.562
ACCESS IS OUR NUMBER ONE WORD.

02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:51.764
I MEAN, LACK OF ACCESS FOR

YOU COULD SUPPLY US WITH SOME

02:08:01.907 --> 02:08:03.509
MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE WE

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:04.810
HAVE TO SELL THIS, THESE IDEAS

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:08.147
AND THE FUNDING AND WHAT IT'S

02:08:08.213 --> 02:08:09.615
COSTING OUR CONSTITUENTS. SO

I'D APPRECIATE THAT. ANYBODY

02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:13.485
HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? IF

02:08:13.552 --> 02:08:15.921
NOT, WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:17.856

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:22.821
THANK YOU. START. HI. PLEASE DO

02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:23.589
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:25.357
JENNIFER GREPPI. I'M THE

02:09:25.424 --> 02:09:27.826
DIRECTOR OF PARENT POLICY WITH

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:29.962
PARENT VOICES CALIFORNIA. AND

02:09:30.028 --> 02:09:32.498
FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS, I'VE

02:09:32.564 --> 02:09:34.066
WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ADDRESS

02:09:34.133 --> 02:09:35.634
THE SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION THAT

02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:37.536
HAVE CREATED OBSTACLES AND

02:09:37.603 --> 02:09:39.138
ROADBLOCKS FOR FAMILIES TO

02:09:39.204 --> 02:09:40.606
ACCESS THE QUALITY EARLY

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:42.808
LEARNING THAT THEY NEED FOR

02:09:42.875 --> 02:09:45.511
THEIR KIDS. 22 YEARS AGO, WHEN

02:09:45.577 --> 02:09:47.079
MY HUSBAND PASSED AWAY,

02:09:47.146 --> 02:09:49.681
SUDDENLY I FOUND MYSELF IN NEED

02:09:49.748 --> 02:09:50.582
OF CHILDCARE SERVICES FOR MY

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:53.519
TWO LITTLE ONES. I ENTERED THE

02:09:53.585 --> 02:09:55.587
CALWORKS PROGRAM AND STARTED

02:09:55.654 --> 02:09:57.422
BOTH MY KIDS AND CHILDCARE

02:09:57.489 --> 02:09:58.490
WHILE I WENT TO SCHOOL TO

02:09:58.557 --> 02:10:01.093
BECOME A PRESCHOOL TEACHER.

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:03.428
AFTER GRADUATING, I HAD MY VERY

02:10:03.495 --> 02:10:05.731
FIRST JOB IN A CHILDCARE CENTER.

02:10:05.797 --> 02:10:07.766
WHEN I RECEIVED A LETTER THAT

02:10:07.833 --> 02:10:08.667
SAID, YOUR CHILDCARE IS IN

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:10.402
DANGER OF GETTING CUT OFF, GET

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:13.639
ON THE BUS. AND THAT WAS MY

02:10:13.705 --> 02:10:16.341
VERY FIRST TRIP TO SACRAMENTO.

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:18.610
I GOT ON THE BUS AND I MET

02:10:18.677 --> 02:10:20.379
PARENT VOICES THAT DAY, AND I

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:22.481
WENT INTO THE CAPITOL AND I

02:10:22.548 --> 02:10:23.849
TOLD MY VERY PERSONAL STORY

02:10:23.916 --> 02:10:25.450
ABOUT WHY CHILDCARE WAS SO

02:10:25.517 --> 02:10:28.620
IMPORTANT TO MY FAMILY. I KNEW

02:10:28.687 --> 02:10:30.355
WITHOUT CHILDCARE, I WOULD NOT

02:10:30.422 --> 02:10:31.423
BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK,

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:33.759
AND ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT I

02:10:33.825 --> 02:10:35.494
HAD MADE TO STAND ON MY OWN

02:10:35.561 --> 02:10:37.362
WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ME.

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:39.765
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WENT

02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:40.966
TO SACRAMENTO AND TO THE

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:41.833
CAPITOL. I'VE MADE HUNDREDS OF

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.635
TRIPS IN THE TWO DECADES THAT

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:45.571
FOLLOWED, AND WHILE WE'VE BEEN

02:10:45.637 --> 02:10:47.739
ABLE TO MAKE SOME REALLY

02:10:47.806 --> 02:10:50.509
SIGNIFICANT WINS IN THAT TIME,

02:10:50.576 --> 02:10:53.412
LET'S REVIEW WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

02:10:53.478 --> 02:10:55.480
THERE ARE STILL NEARLY 2

02:10:55.547 --> 02:10:57.449
MILLION FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:59.484
ELIGIBLE FOR CHILDCARE, BUT NOT

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:01.887
RECEIVING IT. THE MAJORITY OF

02:11:01.954 --> 02:11:03.789
THESE FAMILIES ARE BLACK AND

02:11:03.855 --> 02:11:05.357
BROWN. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.559
STILL AMONG THE LOWEST PAID

02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:10.829
WORKERS IN OUR STATE. 98% OF

02:11:10.896 --> 02:11:12.631
CHILDCARE WORKERS ARE WOMEN,

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:14.399
AND OVER TWO THIRDS ARE WOMEN

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:17.669
OF COLOR. PHªN PROVIDERS ONLY

02:11:17.736 --> 02:11:19.504
RECEIVE 70% OF THE FAMILY

02:11:19.571 --> 02:11:22.608
CHILDCARE RATE, AND IN THE NEW

02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:24.009
RATE STRUCTURE, THEY'LL MAKE

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:26.445
EVEN LESS. IF IT'S OKAY FOR

02:11:26.511 --> 02:11:28.347
WEALTHY FAMILIES TO PAY A NANNY

02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:30.449
OR FAMILY MEMBER, WHY ARE WE

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:31.984
DENYING THAT SAME RIGHT TO

02:11:32.050 --> 02:11:34.419
FAMILIES LIKE QUINN? AND WE

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:37.990
HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:39.591
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS ARE USING

02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:41.393
RIGHT NOW TO BUY UP MORE AND

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.528
MORE OF THE CHILDCARE SUPPLY,

02:11:43.595 --> 02:11:45.831
PLACING PROFITS OVER PROVIDERS

02:11:45.897 --> 02:11:49.601
AND CHILDREN. DO WE NOTICE A

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:51.603
PATTERN? OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM

02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:53.338
IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS THE

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:55.440
FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

02:11:55.507 --> 02:11:57.876
WORLD, IS BUILT ON THE BACKS OF

02:11:57.943 --> 02:12:00.379
WOMEN, PRIMARILY WOMEN OF COLOR.

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:02.748
RACISM AND SEXISM ARE FEATURES

02:12:02.814 --> 02:12:05.484
OF OUR CHILDCARE SYSTEM, NOT

02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:08.353
JUST BUGS. THE RACIST ROOTS OF

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.455
CHILDCARE RUNS DEEP IN THE US.

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:12.190
OUR NATION'S FIRST CHILDCARE

02:12:12.257 --> 02:12:14.393
PROVIDERS WERE ENSLAVED BLACK

02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:16.895
WOMEN FORCED TO CARE FOR

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:18.764
CHILDREN OF THEIR ENSLAVERS.

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:19.631
DOMESTIC WORKERS WERE EXCLUDED

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:23.035
FROM THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:25.804
ACT IN 1938, AND THE MYTH OF A

02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:26.538
WELFARE QUEEN, POPULARIZED BY

02:12:26.605 --> 02:12:29.508
OUR VERY OWN RONALD REAGAN,

02:12:29.574 --> 02:12:31.743
CRIMINALIZED POOR BLACK WOMEN

02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:32.878
FOR SEEKING BENEFITS, A

02:12:32.944 --> 02:12:34.313
STEREOTYPE THAT WE STILL FIGHT

02:12:34.379 --> 02:12:37.516
TO THIS DAY. THOSE OF US IN

02:12:37.582 --> 02:12:39.651
THIS ROOM MIGHT NOT BE

02:12:39.718 --> 02:12:40.385
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RACISM AND

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:42.921
SEXISM IN OUR CHILDCARE SYSTEM.

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:44.523
BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY, EVERY

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:47.225
MONTH, EVERY YEAR THAT WE DON'T

02:12:47.292 --> 02:12:50.462
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, WE ARE

02:12:50.529 --> 02:12:52.264
COMPLICIT IN CONTINUING IT. AS

02:12:52.331 --> 02:12:54.466
I MENTIONED, CALIFORNIA IS THE

02:12:54.533 --> 02:12:55.767
FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

02:12:55.834 --> 02:12:57.602
WORLD. IT SURE SOUNDS

02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:59.971
IMPRESSIVE ON PAPER, BUT I TALK

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:01.206
TO FAMILIES EVERY SINGLE DAY

02:13:01.273 --> 02:13:03.408
THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO GET BY,

02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:04.576
STRUGGLING TO PAY RENT, BILLS,

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:06.378
CHILDCARE, HEALTH CARE. AND I

02:13:06.445 --> 02:13:08.480
WANT YOU TO ASK THEM HOW IT

02:13:08.547 --> 02:13:09.648
FEELS TO LIVE IN THE FOURTH

02:13:09.715 --> 02:13:11.416
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

02:13:11.483 --> 02:13:13.352
ASK THEM IF THEY'RE SHARING IN

02:13:13.418 --> 02:13:15.253
THE WEALTH. IT BEGS THE

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.489
QUESTION, WHO BENEFITS? ONE

02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:19.424
PLACE TO START MIGHT BE LOOKING

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:22.060
AT THE ULTRA WEALTHY AND

02:13:22.127 --> 02:13:23.061
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.

02:13:23.128 --> 02:13:25.330
IT'S FUNNY, IN ALL MY YEARS, IN

02:13:25.397 --> 02:13:26.665
ALL MY YEARS COMING TO THE

02:13:26.732 --> 02:13:28.767
CAPITOL, NOT ONCE, NOT A SINGLE

02:13:28.834 --> 02:13:30.435
TIME HAVE I EVER SEEN OR HEARD

02:13:30.502 --> 02:13:31.503
A CORPORATE EXECUTIVE COME IN

02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:33.605
FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE AND GIVE

02:13:33.672 --> 02:13:34.706
PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEADING TO

02:13:34.773 --> 02:13:36.475
MAINTAIN THEIR TAX BENEFITS.

02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:38.243
THE WATER'S EDGE ELECTION AND

02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:39.611
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX

02:13:39.678 --> 02:13:41.580
CREDITS COST THE STATE OF

02:13:41.646 --> 02:13:43.281
CALIFORNIA $6 BILLION EVERY

02:13:43.348 --> 02:13:45.517
YEAR. THAT'S NEARLY AS MUCH AS

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:48.387
WE SPEND ON CHILD CARE IN THE

02:13:48.453 --> 02:13:51.390
STATE AS A WHOLE. NOT ONCE HAS

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:53.325
A CORPORATION HAD TO JUSTIFY

02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:55.627
THOSE EXPENDITURES. I ASK YOU,

02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:57.562
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW EVERYDAY

02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:59.464
CALIFORNIANS BENEFIT FROM THESE

02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:03.034
TAX BREAKS THAT WE RUBBER STAMP

02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:04.536
EVERY YEAR, ACCORDING TO THE

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:06.772
BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER, SINCE

02:14:06.838 --> 02:14:07.706
2002, CORPORATE PROFITS HAVE

02:14:07.773 --> 02:14:11.777
RISEN 133%. THAT'S AFTER

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:12.511
ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION.

02:14:12.577 --> 02:14:17.616
WORKERS WAGES 8%. YEP, 8%. WHEN

02:14:17.682 --> 02:14:19.484
OUR COMMUNITY WAS DYING DURING

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:21.520
COVID, THE COVID PANDEMIC,

02:14:21.586 --> 02:14:23.555
THESE CORPORATIONS WERE MAKING

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:25.590
MASSIVE PROFITS. DOES THIS

02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:28.360
SOUND LIKE THE BENEFITS THAT

02:14:28.427 --> 02:14:29.961
ARE TRICKLING DOWN TO OUR

02:14:30.028 --> 02:14:32.898
COMMUNITY? I CERTAINLY DON'T

02:14:32.964 --> 02:14:34.466
FEEL THEM. MEANWHILE, PARENT

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.368
VOICES HAS HAD TO LITERALLY SUE

02:14:36.435 --> 02:14:38.570
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO KEEP

02:14:38.637 --> 02:14:40.038
OUR GOVERNMENT FROM CUTTING

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:41.606
CHILD CARE FUNDING. WE HAVE

02:14:41.673 --> 02:14:42.441
SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS.

02:14:42.507 --> 02:14:43.675
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES HAVE

02:14:43.742 --> 02:14:45.277
TRAVELED FROM ALL OVER OUR

02:14:45.343 --> 02:14:47.946
STATE TO COME HERE TO SPEAK TO

02:14:48.013 --> 02:14:48.747
YOU, TO DEMAND JUSTICE FOR OUR

02:14:48.814 --> 02:14:51.516
FAMILIES. AND TO BE HONEST, I

02:14:51.583 --> 02:14:54.352
DON'T SEE AN END IN SIGHT. AT

02:14:54.419 --> 02:14:56.388
THE RATE WE'RE GOING. MY

02:14:56.455 --> 02:14:58.356
GRANDDAUGHTERS, MELANIE AND

02:14:58.423 --> 02:15:01.092
ALANI, MIGHT BE SITTING HERE IN

02:15:01.159 --> 02:15:03.962
FRONT OF YOU AS THE NEXT

02:15:04.029 --> 02:15:04.930
GENERATION, ASKING OUR

02:15:04.996 --> 02:15:08.433
LEGISLATORS ONE DAY, WILL YOU

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:11.636
MAKE A CHANGE FOR US? ENOUGH IS

02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:14.039
ENOUGH. IT'S TIME FOR OUR

02:15:14.105 --> 02:15:15.707
LEADERS WHO CANNOT TOLERATE

02:15:15.774 --> 02:15:17.476
ANOTHER SECOND OF THIS TO TAKE

02:15:17.542 --> 02:15:20.812
BOLD ACTION. I KNOW YOU'RE ALL

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:21.513
RIGHT HERE, I SEE YOU, I SEE

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:23.949
YOU, AND THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT

02:15:24.015 --> 02:15:25.250
FROM YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE.

02:15:25.317 --> 02:15:27.986
LEADERSHIP TO US, MEANS THAT WE

02:15:28.053 --> 02:15:29.554
STOP PRETENDING LIKE CORPORATE

02:15:29.621 --> 02:15:31.289
TAX BREAKS AND FUNDING THE

02:15:31.356 --> 02:15:32.924
AVAILABILITY OF CHILD CARE ARE

02:15:32.991 --> 02:15:36.061
NOT CONNECTED. LEADERSHIP MEANS

02:15:36.127 --> 02:15:37.562
IMPLEMENTING A TRUE COST OF

02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:39.631
CARE SO THAT PROVIDERS EARN

02:15:39.698 --> 02:15:40.565
THRIVING WAGES, AND PARENTS

02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:43.568
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE CO-PAYMENTS.

02:15:43.635 --> 02:15:44.803
LEADERSHIP MEANS FULLY FUNDING

02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:48.073
OUR SYSTEM TO PUT AN END TO THE

02:15:48.139 --> 02:15:51.877
WAITING LIST. LEADERSHIP MEANS

02:15:51.943 --> 02:15:53.278
CONFRONTING THE RISE OF PRIVATE

02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:55.881
EQUITY IN THE CHILDCARE SPACE.

02:15:55.947 --> 02:15:57.282
THIS IS A MAJOR COMMITMENT, I

02:15:57.349 --> 02:16:00.819
KNOW, BUT IF WE ARE NOT

02:16:00.886 --> 02:16:01.653
COMMITTED TO THAT VISION, THEN

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:04.589
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? I KNOW

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:06.358
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ALL OF

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:09.427
YOU OVER MANY YEARS FOR SOME

02:16:09.494 --> 02:16:12.998
REALLY MEANINGFUL AND DEEP AND

02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:15.400
PROGRESSIVE, YOU KNOW, POLICIES

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:18.537
THAT HAVE MADE SOME REAL GOOD

02:16:18.603 --> 02:16:19.871
CHANGES FOR FAMILIES, FAMILY

02:16:19.938 --> 02:16:22.841
FEES BEING ONE OF THEM, STAGE

02:16:22.908 --> 02:16:24.042
ONE FROM DAY ONE, AND MANY

02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:26.578
OTHERS. I KNOW YOU CARE DEEPLY

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:29.314
ABOUT THIS ISSUE, AND WE NEED

02:16:29.381 --> 02:16:31.516
TO HOLD OURSELVES TO A HIGHER

02:16:31.583 --> 02:16:32.417
STANDARD. WE HAVE TO BELIEVE

02:16:32.484 --> 02:16:33.885
IT'S POSSIBLE TO PAY CHILDCARE

02:16:33.952 --> 02:16:35.453
PROVIDERS WHAT THEY DESERVE,

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:37.722
AND ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE

02:16:37.789 --> 02:16:39.457
FAMILY HAS ACCESS TO THE CARE

02:16:39.524 --> 02:16:42.594
THAT THEY DESERVE TOGETHER.

02:16:42.661 --> 02:16:44.629

AND THE ANSWERS ARE WITH THE

02:16:54.573 --> 02:16:55.774

THIS EVERY DAY. AND WE CAN HELP

02:17:01.179 --> 02:17:01.813
SHARE THE SOLUTIONS TO MAKE

02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:04.215

02:17:37.916 --> 02:17:40.652
ONLY ORGANIZATION IN CALIFORNIA

02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:41.419
DEDICATED TO ADVOCATING FOR

SAFE, NURTURING AND LOVING

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:45.957
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FOR

BLACK CHILDREN, FAMILIES, AND

02:17:46.725 --> 02:17:50.395
EARLY EDUCATORS. BLACK Â IS A

02:17:50.462 --> 02:17:51.696
LEADING VOICE FOR THE NEEDS AND

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:52.764
EXPERIENCES OF CALIFORNIA'S

NEARLY 500,000 BLACK CHILDREN,

02:17:55.433 --> 02:17:56.568
THEIR FAMILIES, AND OUR

02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:58.737
COMMUNITY. WE ARE BUILDING A

02:17:58.803 --> 02:17:59.938
STRONG, PROUD COALITION OF

02:18:00.005 --> 02:18:01.806
BLACK ADVOCATES TO SHAPE

FOR BLACK CHILDREN AND AFFIRM

02:18:07.145 --> 02:18:08.380
BLACK CULTURE. AND BECAUSE MY

02:18:08.446 --> 02:18:11.216
TEXTS ARE COMING IN ON MY ON MY

02:18:11.282 --> 02:18:13.551
TABLET, I CAN SEE THAT A LOT OF

02:18:13.618 --> 02:18:17.022
OUR ADVOCATES ARE WATCHING. YES,

02:18:17.088 --> 02:18:19.691
BLACK èC IS GROUNDED IN BLACK

02:18:19.758 --> 02:18:21.860
CULTURE, BLACK JOY, BLACK

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:23.895
HISTORY, BLACK LEGACY, AND

02:18:23.962 --> 02:18:24.729
BLACK EMPOWERMENT. WE'RE PROUD

02:18:24.796 --> 02:18:27.799
TO BE BLACK. OUR COMMITMENT,

02:18:27.866 --> 02:18:28.667
PASSION, AND FIRE IS ANCHORED

02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:30.769
IN BLACK LOVE AND BLACK PRIDE.

02:18:30.835 --> 02:18:33.471
BLACK CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO

02:18:33.538 --> 02:18:36.207
LEARN IN SAFE, NURTURING,

02:18:36.274 --> 02:18:37.542
LOVING ENVIRONMENTS AND

02:18:37.609 --> 02:18:38.209
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIAL

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:40.345
CONNECTION AND GROWTH FOR

02:18:40.412 --> 02:18:41.613
GENERATIONS. AS JENNIFER

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:42.514
MENTIONED, BLACK CAREGIVERS

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.883
HAVE BEEN THE BACKBONE OF OUR

02:18:44.949 --> 02:18:46.217
SOCIETY, PROVIDING NURTURING

02:18:46.284 --> 02:18:47.552
AND ENGAGING CARE FOR TO A

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:49.754
LARGE POPULATION OF OUR

02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:52.290
NATION'S CHILDREN. WE VALUE THE

02:18:52.357 --> 02:18:54.526
WISDOM AND EXPERTISE OF BLACK

02:18:54.592 --> 02:18:55.760
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION

02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:57.629
PROVIDERS WHO ARE CONTINUING

02:18:57.696 --> 02:18:59.464
LEGACIES OF NURTURING AND

02:18:59.531 --> 02:19:01.266
RAISING AND EDUCATING ALL

02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:02.634
CHILDREN IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:04.936
REFLECT THEIR BACKGROUND. WE

02:19:05.003 --> 02:19:06.538
ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF OUR

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:08.540
ANCESTORS WHO MADE A WAY OUT OF

02:19:08.606 --> 02:19:10.308
NO WAY WHILE EXUDING STRENGTH,

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:13.778
LOVE, JOY, AND PRIDE. WE

02:19:13.845 --> 02:19:14.679
REFLECT THE RICHNESS AND

02:19:14.746 --> 02:19:16.347
DIVERSITY OF OUR EXPERIENCES AS

02:19:16.414 --> 02:19:17.982
BLACK EARLY EDUCATORS,

02:19:18.049 --> 02:19:19.417
CAREGIVERS, PARENTS, CHILDREN,

02:19:19.484 --> 02:19:21.686
AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. BUT OUR

02:19:21.753 --> 02:19:23.488
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM,

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:25.523
FROM POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO

02:19:25.590 --> 02:19:27.726
HOW MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED, WAS

02:19:27.792 --> 02:19:29.461
FOUNDED ON A LEGACY OF RACISM

02:19:29.527 --> 02:19:30.628
TOWARDS BLACK CHILDREN AND

02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:34.332
FAMILIES. AS WE FOCUS TODAY ON

02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:35.633
CHILD CARE COSTS, I WANT TO

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:37.769
BRING ATTENTION TO A DIFFERENT

02:19:37.836 --> 02:19:39.537
KIND OF COST THE COST OF BLACK

02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:41.573
CHILDREN NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:19:41.639 --> 02:19:42.607
RECEIVE CULTURALLY AFFIRMING

02:19:42.674 --> 02:19:45.510
CARE AND EDUCATION. LAST WEEK,

02:19:45.577 --> 02:19:47.278
BLACK HOSTED OUR SECOND EVER

02:19:47.345 --> 02:19:49.447
SYMPOSIUM, WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON

02:19:49.514 --> 02:19:51.216
DISMANTLING LINGUISTIC

02:19:51.282 --> 02:19:52.851
OPPRESSION FOR BLACK CHILDREN

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:53.685
IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION.

02:19:53.752 --> 02:19:55.453
AND THERE WERE SO MANY MOMENTS,

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:58.523
BUT ONE THAT REALLY STANDS OUT

02:19:58.590 --> 02:20:00.125
IS WHEN TWO DIFFERENT

02:20:00.191 --> 02:20:01.493
PRESENTERS TALKED ABOUT HOW

02:20:01.559 --> 02:20:02.627
THEIR BLACK ENGLISH WAS

02:20:02.694 --> 02:20:04.262
CORRECTED WHEN THEY WERE IN

02:20:04.329 --> 02:20:05.864
SCHOOL, STARTING IN EARLY CARE

02:20:05.930 --> 02:20:07.832
AND EDUCATION, AND HOW THAT

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:08.700
CORRECTION TELLS YOUNG CHILDREN

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:10.602
THAT THE WAY THEIR MOTHER TALKS,

02:20:10.668 --> 02:20:11.736
THEIR FATHER, THEIR GRANDMOTHER,

02:20:11.803 --> 02:20:13.505
THEIR AUNTIES, THEIR UNCLES IS

02:20:13.571 --> 02:20:15.440
WRONG. AND BY TAKING THOSE KIND

02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:17.976
OF STEPS, WE'RE ON A PATH

02:20:18.042 --> 02:20:20.378
TOWARDS ELIMINATING AND AND

02:20:20.445 --> 02:20:21.980
DISAPPEARING. SUCH AN IMPORTANT

02:20:22.046 --> 02:20:24.349
PART OF BLACK CULTURE. ANOTHER

02:20:24.415 --> 02:20:26.451
CO-FOUNDER AND I SHARE MEMORIES

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:28.953
OF A CO-FOUNDER OF BLACK SEA.

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.488
BLACK SHARE MEMORIES OF

02:20:30.555 --> 02:20:31.422
DROPPING OFF OUR DAUGHTERS IN

02:20:31.489 --> 02:20:33.458
THE MORNING TO THEIR CHILD CARE

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:34.592
PROVIDERS. MAYBE WITH TWO AFRO

02:20:34.659 --> 02:20:36.327
PUFFS, MAYBE WITH A LITTLE AFRO,

02:20:36.394 --> 02:20:38.429
BUT THEN PICKING THEM UP IN THE

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:39.931
AFTERNOON WITH THEIR HAIR

02:20:39.998 --> 02:20:42.300
BEAUTIFULLY CORNROWED IN BRAIDS,

02:20:42.367 --> 02:20:45.270
WHICH THEN LEADS TO AT LEAST

02:20:45.336 --> 02:20:47.172
TWO WEEKS OF NOT HAVING TO GET

02:20:47.238 --> 02:20:48.706
UP EARLY TO DO THEIR HAIR. THIS

02:20:48.773 --> 02:20:51.376
IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE

02:20:51.442 --> 02:20:53.511
CULTURAL CAPITAL THAT BLACK

02:20:53.578 --> 02:20:54.379
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION

02:20:54.445 --> 02:20:57.916
PROVIDERS BRING TO THIS TO OUR

02:20:57.982 --> 02:20:59.484
SYSTEM, BUT WE HAVE A RACIAL

02:20:59.551 --> 02:21:01.419
WAGE INJUSTICE PROBLEM, AND

02:21:01.486 --> 02:21:02.654
THIS PROBLEM LIMITS THE

02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.656
OPPORTUNITY FOR BLACK CHILDREN

02:21:04.722 --> 02:21:05.590
TO RECEIVE CULTURALLY AFFIRMING

02:21:05.657 --> 02:21:08.259
CARE. THIS COSTS FAMILIES THE

02:21:08.326 --> 02:21:09.961
ABILITY TO SHORE UP THEIR

02:21:10.028 --> 02:21:11.496
CHILDREN'S RACIAL PRIDE BEFORE

02:21:11.563 --> 02:21:13.331
THEY ENTER THE K THROUGH 12

02:21:13.398 --> 02:21:14.899
SYSTEM, WHERE WE KNOW THAT

02:21:14.966 --> 02:21:17.335
PRIDE IS CHALLENGED EVERY DAY.

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:18.570
ACCORDING TO THE UC BERKELEY

02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:20.805
CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF CHILD

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:22.307
CARE EMPLOYMENT, BLACK LEAD

02:21:22.373 --> 02:21:24.042
TEACHERS, COMPARED TO ALL OTHER

02:21:24.108 --> 02:21:26.845
LEAD TEACHERS, ARE PAID $2,288

02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:29.581
LESS PER YEAR. BLACK LEAD

02:21:29.647 --> 02:21:31.249
TEACHERS, COMPARED TO WHITE

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:34.619
TEACHERS, ARE PAID $3,120 LESS

02:21:34.686 --> 02:21:37.388
PER YEAR AND BLACK LEAD

02:21:37.455 --> 02:21:38.790
TEACHERS, COMPARED TO ASIAN

02:21:38.857 --> 02:21:41.392
LEAD TEACHERS, ARE ARE PAID

02:21:41.459 --> 02:21:43.995
$6,032 LESS PER YEAR. IT IS

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:46.564
LITERALLY ILLOGICAL FOR A BLACK

02:21:46.631 --> 02:21:48.766
PERSON TO ENTER THIS PROFESSION.

02:21:48.833 --> 02:21:50.468
THAT IS A COST THAT OUR

02:21:50.535 --> 02:21:53.371
CHILDREN CAN'T AFFORD. BUT RATE

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:54.606
REFORM. THERE'S ELEMENTS OF

02:21:54.672 --> 02:21:56.641
RATE REFORM THAT COULD ADDRESS

02:21:56.708 --> 02:22:00.445
THIS. WE COULD PROVIDE PROGRAM

02:22:00.511 --> 02:22:02.247
FUNDING THAT REQUIRE THAT

02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:04.449
REFLECTS THE TRUE COST OF CARE.

02:22:04.515 --> 02:22:05.817
OBVIOUSLY, WITH THRIVING WAGES

02:22:05.884 --> 02:22:09.854
FOR BLACK WOMEN AND THEIR PEERS,

02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:10.755
SALARY SCALES CAN BE FUNDED AND

02:22:10.822 --> 02:22:12.624
DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF

02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:14.492
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND

02:22:14.559 --> 02:22:15.793
EDUCATION AND DATA AND ANALYSIS

02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:17.428
TO PINPOINT DISPARITIES AND

02:22:17.495 --> 02:22:19.697
COURSE CORRECT. I MOSTLY

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:22.367
MENTIONED IN THIS DATA DATA

02:22:22.433 --> 02:22:25.703
AROUND CENTER BASED PROVIDERS,

02:22:25.770 --> 02:22:28.106
EDUCATORS, BUT THE MAJORITY

02:22:28.172 --> 02:22:29.140
ALSO OF BLACK EARLY EDUCATORS

02:22:29.207 --> 02:22:30.842
HAVE FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES.

02:22:30.909 --> 02:22:33.711
AND LIKE MANY OF THE CHALLENGES

02:22:33.778 --> 02:22:35.546
MENTIONED EARLIER WITH HAVING

02:22:35.613 --> 02:22:37.649
TO PAY A STAFF MEMBER, HAVING

02:22:37.715 --> 02:22:39.450
TO PAY RENT, HAVING TO PAY FOR

02:22:39.517 --> 02:22:42.186
FOOD, THEY TOO SUFFER FROM THE

02:22:42.253 --> 02:22:43.288
RACIAL WAGE JUSTICE. SO I WOULD

02:22:43.354 --> 02:22:45.590
JUST LIKE TO LEAVE YOU, REMIND

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:46.925
YOU THAT BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:22:46.991 --> 02:22:48.927
INDEED A BLESSING TO OUR STATE,

02:22:48.993 --> 02:22:50.561
AND WE WOULD DO REALLY WELL TO

02:22:50.628 --> 02:22:52.397
REMEMBER THAT. YES. THANK YOU

02:22:52.463 --> 02:22:54.399
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I

02:22:54.465 --> 02:22:58.770
THINK NEXT WE HAVE UP LAKISHA.

02:22:58.836 --> 02:23:03.207
WELCOME. THANK YOU. LAKISHA

02:23:03.274 --> 02:23:09.580
DOYLE. BEFORE I JUST MAKE A

02:23:09.647 --> 02:23:10.315
SHORT STATEMENT, BECAUSE I

02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:13.051
PROMISED TO GIVE YOU ALL TIME

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:17.822
BACK ON TODAY. I'D JUST LIKE TO

02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:21.526
WELCOME YOU ALL IN TO MY POINT

02:23:21.592 --> 02:23:23.261
OF VIEW, MY MIND WHEN

02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:27.532
CONSIDERING CHILDCARE. I AM A

02:23:27.598 --> 02:23:30.835
35 YEAR OLD MOTHER OF THREE. I

02:23:30.902 --> 02:23:33.738
WAITED A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN

02:23:33.805 --> 02:23:35.640
SOME OF MY PEERS TO HAVE A

02:23:35.707 --> 02:23:39.010
CHILD, MOSTLY BECAUSE I SAW THE

02:23:39.077 --> 02:23:40.545
HARDSHIP THAT HAPPENS. IF YOU

02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:41.679
ARE NOT PREPARED TO HAVE

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:45.316
CHILDREN. I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN

02:23:45.383 --> 02:23:48.119
I SAID I WILL NEVER BE A SINGLE

02:23:48.186 --> 02:23:50.288
MOTHER, AND THE WAY THAT MY

02:23:50.355 --> 02:23:53.458
LIFE PANNED OUT, I WAS

02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:54.325
DEFINITELY A SINGLE MOTHER. FOR

02:23:54.392 --> 02:23:56.627
THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS OF MY

02:23:56.694 --> 02:23:59.330
DAUGHTER'S LIFE. NOT NOT BY NOT

02:23:59.397 --> 02:24:01.599
BY CHOICE, OF COURSE, BUT FOR

02:24:01.666 --> 02:24:03.267
THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF MY

02:24:03.334 --> 02:24:04.569
DAUGHTER'S LIFE, HER FATHER WAS

02:24:04.635 --> 02:24:06.537
INCARCERATED. HE WAS UNABLE TO

02:24:06.604 --> 02:24:08.573
PHYSICALLY BE THERE TO PROVIDE

02:24:08.639 --> 02:24:10.508
FOR HIS CHILD, BUT HE DID IN

02:24:10.575 --> 02:24:12.610
EVERY OTHER WAY THAT HE COULD.

02:24:12.677 --> 02:24:13.478
WHEN? WHEN SHE WAS SIX YEARS

02:24:13.544 --> 02:24:16.481
OLD, HE PASSED AWAY. HE DIED.

02:24:16.547 --> 02:24:18.883
AND I BECAME A VERY SINGLE

02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:24.422
MOTHER. AND NAVIGATING THAT

02:24:24.489 --> 02:24:29.494
TYPE OF LIFESTYLE, YOU KNOW,

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.363
YOU YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:34.532
YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR YOUR CHILD.

02:24:34.599 --> 02:24:36.868
AND AND THAT DEFINITELY

02:24:36.934 --> 02:24:39.637
ENCOMPASSES CHILDCARE. RIGHT? I

02:24:39.704 --> 02:24:41.406
HAVE THE FIRM BELIEF THAT IF

02:24:41.472 --> 02:24:42.640
YOU HAVE CHILDREN, YOU SHOULD

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:44.642
TAKE CARE OF THEM. THAT IS JUST

02:24:44.709 --> 02:24:46.010
MY PERSONAL CONVICTION. IF YOU

02:24:46.077 --> 02:24:47.979
HAVE CHILDREN, YOU ARE SOLELY

02:24:48.046 --> 02:24:48.579
RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING CARE OF

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:51.682
THOSE CHILDREN. THE WORLD THAT

02:24:51.749 --> 02:24:53.451
WE LIVE IN TODAY, TAKING CARE

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:55.486
OF AND PROVIDING FOR YOUR CHILD

02:24:55.553 --> 02:24:57.555
MEANS QUALITY CHILDCARE BECAUSE

02:24:57.622 --> 02:25:00.792
YOU NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN YOU

02:25:00.858 --> 02:25:02.226
CANNOT MAKE A LIVING RIGHT THAT

02:25:02.293 --> 02:25:04.595
IS DECENT WITHOUT PHYSICALLY

02:25:04.662 --> 02:25:06.697
GOING TO WORK, WHICH CHILDREN

02:25:06.764 --> 02:25:07.765
ARE NOT ALLOWED IN MOST

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.600
WORKPLACES, RIGHT? AND SO IN

02:25:09.667 --> 02:25:11.369
ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT CARE FOR

02:25:11.436 --> 02:25:14.005
YOUR CHILDREN, YOU NEED TO

02:25:14.072 --> 02:25:15.940
PHYSICALLY LEAVE THEM. AND SO I

02:25:16.007 --> 02:25:18.409
DO UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:25:18.476 --> 02:25:20.478
AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:22.980
THAT IN HAVING TO MAKE CHOICES

02:25:23.047 --> 02:25:26.417
REGARDING CHILDCARE, MOST OF MY

02:25:26.484 --> 02:25:27.518
CONSIDERATIONS AND THINGS THAT

02:25:27.585 --> 02:25:33.658
I HAD TO TO THINK ABOUT. IS THE

02:25:33.724 --> 02:25:35.626
CLIMATE THAT THAT, YOU KNOW, I

02:25:35.693 --> 02:25:37.628
GREW UP IN A TIME WHERE

02:25:37.695 --> 02:25:39.430
KIDNAPING, YOU KNOW, THAT

02:25:39.497 --> 02:25:40.565
BECAME VERY PROMINENT, RIGHT?

02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:42.867
THOSE WERE THINGS THAT YOU HAD

02:25:42.934 --> 02:25:44.469
TO WATCH OUT FOR CHILD NEGLECT

02:25:44.535 --> 02:25:49.373
AND MISTREATMENT. WHAT ELSE? A

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:50.675
PLETHORA OF OTHER THINGS THAT

02:25:50.741 --> 02:25:52.410
CAME TO LIGHT THAT WERE ALREADY

02:25:52.477 --> 02:25:54.378
HAPPENING. BUT I GREW UP IN A

02:25:54.445 --> 02:25:55.680
TIME WHERE THOSE THINGS CAME TO

02:25:55.746 --> 02:25:57.849
LIGHT. RIGHT. AND SO WE KIND OF

02:25:57.915 --> 02:25:59.484
GREW UP WITH THAT FEAR OF

02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:00.384
SOMEONE MIGHT TAKE MY CHILD OR

02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:03.087
ABUSE MY CHILD IN SOME WAY,

02:26:03.154 --> 02:26:04.856
SHAPE OR FORM. MEDIA BECAME

02:26:04.922 --> 02:26:06.390
VERY POPULAR. RECORDINGS OF

02:26:06.457 --> 02:26:08.426
DAYCARE CENTERS AND CHILDREN

02:26:08.493 --> 02:26:10.261
BEING ABUSED FOR NO REASON, YOU

02:26:10.328 --> 02:26:11.762
KNOW, AND THERE'S NEVER A

02:26:11.829 --> 02:26:13.631
REASON TO ABUSE A CHILD. AND SO,

02:26:13.698 --> 02:26:15.266
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD SEE THOSE

02:26:15.333 --> 02:26:16.601
THINGS ON THE NEWS AND THINGS

02:26:16.667 --> 02:26:18.436
LIKE THAT. AND SO WHEN

02:26:18.503 --> 02:26:20.338
CONSIDERING CHILDCARE, NOT ONLY

02:26:20.404 --> 02:26:21.706
DO YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER, DO I

02:26:21.772 --> 02:26:23.307
FEEL COMFORTABLE, DO I FEEL

02:26:23.374 --> 02:26:24.942
SAFE LEAVING MY CHILD IN THIS

02:26:25.009 --> 02:26:27.612
SPACE, WHETHER THE PLACE IS

02:26:27.678 --> 02:26:28.412
PROFESSIONAL OR NOT? BECAUSE

02:26:28.479 --> 02:26:30.581
I'VE SEEN CASE AFTER CASE OF

02:26:30.648 --> 02:26:32.583
CERTIFIED CHILDCARE CENTERS

02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:34.519
BEING, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE

02:26:34.585 --> 02:26:36.521
PLACES THAT ARE THAT ARE

02:26:36.587 --> 02:26:38.422
PORTRAYED TO THE ON THE NEWS IN

02:26:38.489 --> 02:26:41.425
A PUBLIC WAY OF ABUSE HAPPENING

02:26:41.492 --> 02:26:43.794
IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR FORM TO A

02:26:43.861 --> 02:26:46.931
CHILD. AND SO, YOU KNOW, YOU

02:26:46.998 --> 02:26:49.600
CONSIDER THE, THE, YOU KNOW,

02:26:49.667 --> 02:26:51.435
ARE YOU SAFE? ARE YOU, YOU KNOW,

02:26:51.502 --> 02:26:53.504
IS MY CHILD SAFE? AND DO YOU

02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:54.805
HAVE A PEACE OF MIND REGARDING

02:26:54.872 --> 02:26:56.440
THAT? BUT YOU ALSO CONSIDER THE

02:26:56.507 --> 02:26:58.376
COST, RIGHT. AND SO AS THE CARE

02:26:58.442 --> 02:27:00.645
THE QUALITY OF CARE INCREASES,

02:27:00.711 --> 02:27:02.647
THE COST INCREASES. I REMEMBER

02:27:02.713 --> 02:27:04.749
A TIME WHERE I HAD TO PAY OUT

02:27:04.815 --> 02:27:07.919
OF POCKET AS A SINGLE MOTHER.

02:27:07.985 --> 02:27:11.022
YOU KNOW, MY CHILD CARE

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:13.357
PROVIDER, I HAD TO PAY THEM FOR

02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:17.228
MONTHS BACK PAY BECAUSE FOR

02:27:17.295 --> 02:27:19.430
WHATEVER THE REASON, THEY WERE

02:27:19.497 --> 02:27:21.265
NOT SIGNED UP IN TIME FOR THE

02:27:21.332 --> 02:27:23.367
RESOURCES, THE CHILD ACTION,

02:27:23.434 --> 02:27:24.535
THE STAGE ONE, CHILD CARE,

02:27:24.602 --> 02:27:25.603
THINGS LIKE THAT, THOSE

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:26.404
RESOURCES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

02:27:26.470 --> 02:27:29.774
HELP PEOPLE UTILIZING CALWORKS

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:32.443
OR OR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IN SOME

02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:34.712
WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. THERE'S A

02:27:34.779 --> 02:27:36.347
TIME, THERE'S A TIME FRAME THAT

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:38.482
GOES ALONG WITH THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:27:38.549 --> 02:27:39.817
AND I REMEMBER THAT THE CHILD

02:27:39.884 --> 02:27:41.385
CARE PROVIDER THAT I HAD CHOSE

02:27:41.452 --> 02:27:43.554
FOR MY CHILDREN, SHE WAS NOT

02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:45.489
SIGNED UP IN TIME OR IN THAT

02:27:45.556 --> 02:27:47.525
TIME FRAME. AND SO I ENDED UP

02:27:47.592 --> 02:27:48.459
HAVING TO COME OUT OF POCKET.

02:27:48.526 --> 02:27:50.461
BUT YOU'RE COMING OUT OF POCKET

02:27:50.528 --> 02:27:51.696
AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR NOT ONLY

02:27:51.762 --> 02:27:53.364
THE CHILD CARE, BUT YOU'RE ALSO

02:27:53.431 --> 02:27:54.498
PAYING RENT AT THE TIME, AND

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:56.400
YOU'RE PAYING FOR YOUR VEHICLE,

02:27:56.467 --> 02:27:57.935
AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR OTHER

02:27:58.002 --> 02:27:58.803
EXPENSES THAT YOU KNOW, OF

02:27:58.869 --> 02:28:03.307
COURSE WE ALL HAVE. AND SO IT

02:28:03.374 --> 02:28:04.609
DOES CAUSE CHILD QUALITY CHILD

02:28:04.675 --> 02:28:08.512
CARE DOES COST. AND SO I SAID

02:28:08.579 --> 02:28:10.781
THAT TO SAY THAT IN CONSIDERING

02:28:10.848 --> 02:28:13.417
CHILD CARE FOR MY OWN CHILDREN,

02:28:13.484 --> 02:28:15.586
I HAVE THE BACKGROUND OF

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:16.487
EXPERIENCE, RIGHT, GROWING UP

02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:20.024
IN THE CULTURE. BUT THEN I ALSO

02:28:20.091 --> 02:28:21.392
HAVE THE EDUCATION WHERE I'VE

02:28:21.459 --> 02:28:23.794
BEEN EDUCATED AS AN EARLY

02:28:23.861 --> 02:28:27.031
CHILDHOOD, EARLY CHILD CARE

02:28:27.098 --> 02:28:32.570
EDUCATOR, AND I HAVE SEEN THE

02:28:32.637 --> 02:28:35.439
NEED FOR QUALITY CHILD CARE,

02:28:35.506 --> 02:28:37.575
BUT I'VE ALSO EXPERIENCED IT.

02:28:37.642 --> 02:28:39.877
I'M NO LONGER A SINGLE MOTHER.

02:28:39.944 --> 02:28:41.712
I'M MARRIED TO A VERY CARING

02:28:41.779 --> 02:28:45.650
AND DEVOTED SPOUSE, AND HE DOES

02:28:45.716 --> 02:28:48.386
HIS PART AND I DO MY PART. AND

02:28:48.452 --> 02:28:50.221
THEN YOU STILL SEE THE NEED,

02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:51.422
RIGHT? YOU HAVE TWO PARENTS

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:53.557
THAT ARE WORKING AND OR GOING

02:28:53.624 --> 02:28:56.394
TO SCHOOL, AND THEN YOU HAVE

02:28:56.460 --> 02:28:58.863
CHILDREN WHO STILL YET NEED

02:28:58.929 --> 02:29:00.564
CHILDCARE, RIGHT? SO I'VE ALSO

02:29:00.631 --> 02:29:02.466
SEEN THAT PART BECAUSE ONE

02:29:02.533 --> 02:29:04.669
WOULD THINK THAT, WELL, THAT

02:29:04.735 --> 02:29:06.270
SOLVES EVERYTHING, BUT IT

02:29:06.337 --> 02:29:07.505
DOESN'T. IT KIND OF PUTS A

02:29:07.571 --> 02:29:09.674
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A STRAIN

02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:10.775
BECAUSE THEN YOU DON'T QUALIFY

02:29:10.841 --> 02:29:11.676
FOR CERTAIN SERVICES OR THINGS

02:29:11.742 --> 02:29:13.978
LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A TWO

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:14.578
PARENT HOUSEHOLD. RIGHT. BUT

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:16.447
THEN THE COST OF CHILDCARE IS

02:29:16.514 --> 02:29:19.884
STILL THERE. I REMEMBER WORKING

02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:22.853
AND AT ONE POINT THE CHILDCARE

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:25.423
WAS ALMOST ONE OF OUR SALARIES.

02:29:25.489 --> 02:29:27.658
AND SO IT WAS LIKE, WELL, DO WE

02:29:27.725 --> 02:29:28.459
JUST STAY HOME WITH OUR

02:29:28.526 --> 02:29:31.195
CHILDREN AND, YOU KNOW, EDUCATE

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:32.730
THEM THAT WAY? SO CHOICES HAD

02:29:32.797 --> 02:29:35.466
TO BE MADE. BUT ALL IN ALL, I

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:38.269
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WHILE I

02:29:38.336 --> 02:29:40.471
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:29:40.538 --> 02:29:43.841
QUALITY CHILDCARE, I ALSO

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:45.576
UNDERSTAND THE COST OF IT. AND

02:29:45.643 --> 02:29:47.478
I HOPE YOU ALL DO TOO. THANK

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:50.981
YOU. OH WE DO, THANK YOU VERY

02:29:51.048 --> 02:29:53.517
MUCH. OKAY. I BELIEVE WE HAVE

02:29:53.584 --> 02:29:55.720
WITH US. NOW. LET ME SEE.

02:29:55.786 --> 02:30:00.124
TRISHA. YES. HI. GOOD AFTERNOON.

02:30:00.191 --> 02:30:02.593
GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M MORE. GOOD

02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:04.228
AFTERNOON, CHAIR MEMBERS AND

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:05.463
FELLOW PANELISTS. MY NAME IS

02:30:05.529 --> 02:30:07.531
TRICIA MOORE AND I'M THE OWNER

02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:08.733
OF MORE LEARNING PRESCHOOL IN

02:30:08.799 --> 02:30:10.368
ELK GROVE. I ALSO REPRESENT

02:30:10.434 --> 02:30:12.570
HUNDREDS OF CHILD CARE CENTERS

02:30:12.636 --> 02:30:14.839
AND OWNERS AND DIRECTORS ACROSS

02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:16.407
CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE

02:30:16.474 --> 02:30:17.708
CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE CENTER

02:30:17.775 --> 02:30:20.544
ALLIANCE. I'M LICENSED FOR OVER

02:30:20.611 --> 02:30:22.413
FOR OVER 200 CHILDREN, AND IN

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:25.983
EARLY 2019, I HAD 25 STAFF AND

02:30:26.050 --> 02:30:27.284
OVER 90 STUDENTS AT A SINGLE

02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:29.587
LOCATION. TODAY, I EMPLOY 11

02:30:29.653 --> 02:30:32.356
AND SERVE JUST 87 ACROSS TWO

02:30:32.423 --> 02:30:34.825
SITES, AND ABOUT A THIRD OF MY

02:30:34.892 --> 02:30:37.361
STUDENTS ARE ON SUBSIDY. I'VE

02:30:37.428 --> 02:30:38.562
WORKED IN EARLY CHILDHOOD

02:30:38.629 --> 02:30:40.598
EDUCATION FOR OVER 20 YEARS,

02:30:40.664 --> 02:30:42.600
AND I KNOW THE JOY OF CHILDREN

02:30:42.666 --> 02:30:43.667
THRIVING IN HIGH QUALITY CARE

02:30:43.734 --> 02:30:44.769
AND THE HEARTBREAK WHEN

02:30:44.835 --> 02:30:47.405
FAMILIES LOSE IT. AND HERE IS

02:30:47.471 --> 02:30:49.340
MY REALITY AS A CENTER OWNER.

02:30:49.407 --> 02:30:51.542
THIS SUMMER I LOST 30 CHILDREN

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:54.612
TO FREE TC. FAMILIES LOVE OUR

02:30:54.678 --> 02:30:56.514
SCHOOL, BUT IF YOU CAN SAVE

02:30:56.580 --> 02:30:59.717
$1,400 A MONTH, YOU DO. OTHERS

02:30:59.784 --> 02:31:01.685
CUT HOURS AND DAYS NOT BECAUSE

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:03.721
IT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR

02:31:03.788 --> 02:31:05.656
CHILD, BUT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

02:31:05.723 --> 02:31:08.192
AFFORD IT. WHEN PRESCHOOLERS

02:31:08.259 --> 02:31:10.094
LEAVE, IT DESTABILIZES THE

02:31:10.161 --> 02:31:11.162
ENTIRE CENTER BUDGET. PRESCHOOL

02:31:11.228 --> 02:31:13.531
TUITION NORMALLY HELPS OFFSET

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:15.933
THE MUCH HIGHER COST OF INFANT

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.601
CARE. SO WHAT'S THE TRUE COST

02:31:17.668 --> 02:31:20.604
OF RUNNING AN INFANT PROGRAM?

02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:22.406
MY CURRENT INFANT TUITION IS

02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:25.376
$1,900 A MONTH. THAT'S ALREADY

02:31:25.443 --> 02:31:28.512
A HUGE AMOUNT FOR FAMILIES TO

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:30.514
PAY. THE SUBSIDY RATE FROM

02:31:30.581 --> 02:31:33.451
CHILD ACTION IS 1572. THAT'S

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:35.319
NEARLY A $400 CO-PAY THAT

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:36.587
FAMILIES HAVE TO PAY TO ME TO

02:31:36.654 --> 02:31:39.356
MEET MY CURRENT TUITION. THE

02:31:39.423 --> 02:31:41.592
TRUE COST WOULD BE $2,700 A

02:31:41.659 --> 02:31:43.861
MONTH OR MORE. SO WHAT WOULD

02:31:43.928 --> 02:31:46.564
THAT LOOK LIKE FOR FAMILIES?

02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:49.066
FOR A PRIVATE PAY FAMILY, THAT

02:31:49.133 --> 02:31:51.535
WOULD BE $800 INCREASE A MONTH.

02:31:51.602 --> 02:31:53.571
AND FOR SUBSIDY FAMILIES, IT

02:31:53.637 --> 02:31:55.539
MEANS THEY'D NEED TO PAY A

02:31:55.606 --> 02:31:57.508
CO-PAY OF $1,100. FAMILIES

02:31:57.575 --> 02:31:58.642
ALREADY CANNOT AFFORD CHILD

02:31:58.709 --> 02:32:00.344
CARE IN GENERAL, AND MANY OF MY

02:32:00.411 --> 02:32:01.645
SUBSIDY FAMILIES STRUGGLE JUST

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:03.581
TO COVER THEIR PORTION AS IT IS

02:32:03.647 --> 02:32:05.382
TO KEEP THEM FROM LEAVING. I

02:32:05.449 --> 02:32:06.684
OFTEN OFFER A SCHOLARSHIP TO

02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:08.152
COVER THEIR CO-PAYS, EVEN

02:32:08.219 --> 02:32:09.653
THOUGH IT CUTS INTO MY ALREADY

02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:11.422
NEGATIVE BOTTOM LINE. THE

02:32:11.489 --> 02:32:13.824
FINANCIAL PRESSURE IS

02:32:13.891 --> 02:32:15.893
OVERWHELMING. I'M PERSONALLY

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:18.229
LIABLE FOR $36,000 A MONTH IN

02:32:18.295 --> 02:32:21.532
RENT, AND MY COVID EMERGENCY

02:32:21.599 --> 02:32:22.633
DISASTER LOANS. THIS IS

02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:25.736
SOMETHING THAT I AM PERSONALLY

02:32:25.803 --> 02:32:28.372
LIABLE FOR AND PUTS MY PERSONAL

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:30.541
PROPERTY ON THE LINE. THAT'S

02:32:30.608 --> 02:32:31.775
BEFORE PAYROLL, FOOD, INSURANCE

02:32:31.842 --> 02:32:34.512
OR SUPPLIES. I TOOK ON DEBT

02:32:34.578 --> 02:32:36.146
DURING COVID TO KEEP TEACHERS

02:32:36.213 --> 02:32:37.414
EMPLOYED, AND NOW EVERY MONTH

02:32:37.481 --> 02:32:39.416
WE OPERATE IN THE NEGATIVE.

02:32:39.483 --> 02:32:41.218
WE'VE ALREADY CUT FOOD BUDGETS,

02:32:41.285 --> 02:32:42.586
ELIMINATED ADMIN TOOLS, LAID

02:32:42.653 --> 02:32:44.922
OFF SUPPORT STAFF. THERE'S

02:32:44.989 --> 02:32:45.489
NOTHING LEFT TO CUT. AS AN

02:32:45.556 --> 02:32:47.892
OWNER AND DIRECTOR, I KNOW

02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:48.592
WHERE EVERY HAT LICENSING,

02:32:48.659 --> 02:32:50.194
PAYROLL, ENROLLMENT, PARENT

02:32:50.261 --> 02:32:51.729
MEETINGS, COVERING BREAKS AND

02:32:51.795 --> 02:32:53.697
EVEN COOKING MEALS. THIS LEADS

02:32:53.764 --> 02:32:56.367
ME TO STAFF AND RETENTION.

02:32:56.433 --> 02:32:57.968
STAFFING IS OUR BIGGEST

02:32:58.035 --> 02:32:58.636
CHALLENGE. TEACHERS CAN NOW

02:32:58.702 --> 02:33:01.872
TURN DOWN $24 AN HOUR COMPARED

02:33:01.939 --> 02:33:03.674
TO THE $18 AN HOUR WE PAID FOR

02:33:03.741 --> 02:33:05.376
THE SAME QUALIFIED TEACHER A

02:33:05.442 --> 02:33:07.711
FEW YEARS AGO. WE WANT TO PAY

02:33:07.778 --> 02:33:12.116
MORE, BUT THE MONEY ISN'T THERE.

02:33:12.182 --> 02:33:13.217
TURNOVER IS CONSTANT. IT TAKES

02:33:13.284 --> 02:33:15.753
MONTHS TO TRAIN A TEACHER, BUT

02:33:15.819 --> 02:33:16.754
BY THE TIME THEY'RE CONFIDENT

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:18.589
AND LEAVING FOR, THEY LEAVE FOR

02:33:18.656 --> 02:33:21.058
HIGHER PAY AT FAST FOOD OR

02:33:21.125 --> 02:33:23.260
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ADMINISTRATORS

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:25.462
LIKE ME ARE BACK IN CLASSROOMS

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:26.397
DAILY. I PERSONALLY COVER HOURS

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:28.532
OF BREAKS AND LUNCHES EACH DAY

02:33:28.599 --> 02:33:30.534
JUST TO STAY COMPLIANT. THE

02:33:30.601 --> 02:33:32.536
BIGGER PICTURE THIS ISN'T JUST

02:33:32.603 --> 02:33:34.572
ABOUT MY CENTERS. ACROSS

02:33:34.638 --> 02:33:35.306
CALIFORNIA, FAMILIES ARE

02:33:35.372 --> 02:33:36.473
TRAVELING FURTHER, PIECING

02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:37.575
TOGETHER CARE, RELYING ON

02:33:37.641 --> 02:33:38.776
UNLICENSED OPTIONS. BECAUSE

02:33:38.842 --> 02:33:40.311
INFANT CARE IS VANISHING.

02:33:40.377 --> 02:33:42.613
TEACHERS POUR THEIR HEARTS INTO

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:43.514
THIS WORK, BUT THEY STILL CAN'T

02:33:43.581 --> 02:33:45.549
AFFORD TO LIVE. PARENTS ARE

02:33:45.616 --> 02:33:46.650
CUTTING HOURS OR LEAVING JOBS

02:33:46.717 --> 02:33:48.419
WHERE CARE FALLS THROUGH. AND

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:50.454
I'M NOT ALONE. HUNDREDS OF

02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:51.689
OTHER CHILD CARE CENTER OWNERS

02:33:51.755 --> 02:33:53.524
ARE BATTLING THE SAME ISSUES.

02:33:53.591 --> 02:33:55.793
FOR EXAMPLE, JUST BLOCKS FROM

02:33:55.859 --> 02:33:57.795
HERE, AMY WALKER, SHE ASKED ME

02:33:57.861 --> 02:33:59.463
TO SHARE THIS. HAD TO CLOSE ONE

02:33:59.530 --> 02:34:02.366
OF HER CENTERS, 43 SPOTS AND 12

02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:05.970
JOBS LOST. AMY, LIKE MYSELF,

02:34:06.036 --> 02:34:06.770
HASN'T TAKEN A PAYCHECK AND IS

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:08.405
LOOKING FOR WORK JUST TO BE

02:34:08.472 --> 02:34:09.773
ABLE TO KEEP HER REMAINING

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:11.475
STAFF PAID. YOU CAN READ HER

02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:13.777
FULL STORY AND MANY OTHERS IN

02:34:13.844 --> 02:34:16.280
THE PACKET THAT I PROVIDED. SO

02:34:16.347 --> 02:34:18.415
HOW CAN WE RESTORE THE BALANCE?

02:34:18.482 --> 02:34:20.651
I PROPOSE THAT WE DO THE

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:21.452
FOLLOWING TO KEEP COSTS DOWN

02:34:21.518 --> 02:34:22.653
FOR CHILD CARE CENTERS LIKE

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:24.722
MINE. RATE REFORM TIED TO THE

02:34:24.788 --> 02:34:27.024
TRUE COST OF CARE REIMBURSEMENT

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:29.293
MUST REFLECT THE ACTUAL COST TO

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:30.628
RUN PROGRAMS. CENTERS CANNOT

02:34:30.694 --> 02:34:32.863
KEEP COVERING THE GAP AND

02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:34.264
SURVIVE A MIXED DELIVERY

02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:36.100
ALIGNMENT. PROTECT COMMUNITY

02:34:36.166 --> 02:34:38.268
BASED PROVIDERS ALONGSIDE TC.

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:40.571
IF PROP 98 FUNDS CAN'T INCLUDE

02:34:40.638 --> 02:34:42.506
US, CREATE PARALLEL FUNDING

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:43.807
STREAMS TO KEEP THE SYSTEM

02:34:43.874 --> 02:34:46.877
BALANCED. WORKFORCE SUPPORTS

02:34:46.944 --> 02:34:48.612
INVEST IN WAGES, BENEFITS AND

02:34:48.679 --> 02:34:50.614
RETENTION STRATEGIES. REIGNITE

02:34:50.681 --> 02:34:52.383
PASSION FOR EARLY EDUCATORS TO

02:34:52.449 --> 02:34:53.651
REBUILD THE PIPELINE. SIMILAR

02:34:53.717 --> 02:34:55.719
TO THE PIVOT SACRAMENTO

02:34:55.786 --> 02:34:59.823
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. IN

02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:00.658
CLOSING, CHILDCARE IS A

02:35:00.724 --> 02:35:02.393
WORKFORCE BEHIND THE WORKFORCE,

02:35:02.459 --> 02:35:03.560
AND WHEN IT BREAKS DOWN,

02:35:03.627 --> 02:35:05.429
FAMILIES FACE JOB LOSS, HOUSING

02:35:05.496 --> 02:35:06.964
INSECURITY AND MENTAL HEALTH

02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:09.600
STRUGGLES. WE WERE HAILED THE

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:10.367
HEROES DURING THE PANDEMIC,

02:35:10.434 --> 02:35:11.602
KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE, PARENTS

02:35:11.669 --> 02:35:13.937
WORKING IN THE ECONOMY MOVING.

02:35:14.004 --> 02:35:15.339
TODAY, WE'RE BURIED IN DEBT,

02:35:15.406 --> 02:35:17.508
LEFT OUT OF FAIR FUNDING AND

02:35:17.574 --> 02:35:18.742
COMPETING WITH FREE PROGRAMS

02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:21.512
THAT WE CAN'T ACCESS. I STAY IN

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:22.746
THIS WORK BECAUSE I BELIEVE

02:35:22.813 --> 02:35:23.781
DEEPLY IN WHAT HAPPENS DURING

02:35:23.847 --> 02:35:25.916
THESE EARLY YEARS. EVERY DAY I

02:35:25.983 --> 02:35:28.352
SEE THE JOY OF A CHILD WRITING

02:35:28.419 --> 02:35:29.987
THEIR NAME, MAKING A FRIEND, OR

02:35:30.054 --> 02:35:31.522
DISCOVERING SOMETHING NEW. BUT

02:35:31.588 --> 02:35:33.657
PASSION DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS.

02:35:33.724 --> 02:35:34.625
WITHOUT CHANGE, MORE CENTERS

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:36.593
WILL CLOSE, FAMILIES WILL BE

02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:37.294
LEFT SCRAMBLING, AND OUR

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:38.629
YOUNGEST CHILDREN WILL LOSE THE

02:35:38.696 --> 02:35:40.597
CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. THANK

02:35:40.664 --> 02:35:42.299
YOU FOR LISTENING AND

02:35:42.366 --> 02:35:43.634
CONSIDERING WHAT IT TRULY TAKES

02:35:43.701 --> 02:35:45.536
TO SUSTAIN CHILD CARE IN

02:35:45.602 --> 02:35:46.870
CALIFORNIA, AND I'M AVAILABLE

02:35:46.937 --> 02:35:48.739
FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY

02:35:48.806 --> 02:35:51.975
MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:55.379
MARIN. WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD

02:35:55.446 --> 02:35:57.081
AFTERNOON. CHAIR CO-CHAIR AND

02:35:57.147 --> 02:35:58.615
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:00.484
NAME IS MARINA AND I'M A FAMILY

02:36:00.551 --> 02:36:02.686
CHILD CARE PROVIDER FROM SAN

02:36:02.753 --> 02:36:04.521
DIEGO COUNTY AND A PROUD MEMBER

02:36:04.588 --> 02:36:07.624
OF UW CPU AND ALSO A MEMBER OF

02:36:07.691 --> 02:36:09.493
ITS BARGAINING TEAM. AND I

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:12.029
STAND BEFORE YOU, NOT JUST AS

02:36:12.096 --> 02:36:13.330
AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY CHILD CARE

02:36:13.397 --> 02:36:15.566
PROVIDER, BUT AS A PART OF A

02:36:15.632 --> 02:36:17.835
MOVEMENT THAT HAS SPENT

02:36:17.901 --> 02:36:20.404
GENERATIONS. MY STORY IS A

02:36:20.471 --> 02:36:22.306
PROVIDER. DID NOT BEGUN THE DAY

02:36:22.372 --> 02:36:23.540
I OPENED MY OWN PROGRAM 20

02:36:23.607 --> 02:36:26.543
YEARS AGO. STARTED AS A

02:36:26.610 --> 02:36:29.913
TEENAGER. AS I SAT AT THE TABLE

02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:31.615
WHILE MY MOTHER AND HER FELLOW

02:36:31.682 --> 02:36:33.383
PROVIDERS WERE HAVING THESE

02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:36.253
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ORGANIZING,

02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:40.457
DREAMING, AND FIGHTING FOR A

02:36:40.524 --> 02:36:43.560
VOICE. I GREW UP HEARING MY MOM

02:36:43.627 --> 02:36:45.562
TALKING TO HER FELLOW PROVIDERS

02:36:45.629 --> 02:36:48.098
ABOUT JOINING THE CAUSE,

02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:49.666
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED THAT OUR

02:36:49.733 --> 02:36:52.102
WORK DESERVED DIGNITY AND

02:36:52.169 --> 02:36:54.838
RESPECT, AND IT TOOK NEARLY TWO

02:36:54.905 --> 02:36:58.976
DECADES. YES, 20 YEARS OF

02:36:59.042 --> 02:37:03.180
MEETINGS, RALLIES, PETITIONS

02:37:03.247 --> 02:37:04.581
AND PERSEVERANCE BEFORE FAMILY

02:37:04.648 --> 02:37:07.518
CHILDCARE PROVIDERS FINALLY WON

02:37:07.584 --> 02:37:09.620
THE RIGHT TO FORM A UNION AND

02:37:09.686 --> 02:37:12.656
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS.

02:37:12.723 --> 02:37:14.625
THOSE VICTORIES WERE HANDED TO

02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:18.762
US. IT WAS BUILT ON THE SWEAT,

02:37:18.829 --> 02:37:19.930
TEARS AND SACRIFICE OF

02:37:19.997 --> 02:37:22.733
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN, ESPECIALLY

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:24.668
WOMEN OF COLOR, WHO CARRY THIS

02:37:24.735 --> 02:37:27.437
MOVEMENT FORWARD. AND SINCE

02:37:27.504 --> 02:37:30.007
THEN, WE'VE MADE HISTORY TIME

02:37:30.073 --> 02:37:33.677
AND TIME AND AGAIN TOGETHER.

02:37:33.744 --> 02:37:35.913
WE'VE INCREASED RATES FOR

02:37:35.979 --> 02:37:38.248
SUBSIDIZED CARE. WE HAVE

02:37:38.315 --> 02:37:41.485
SECURED HEALTH CARE AND A

02:37:41.552 --> 02:37:43.320
TRAINING FUND. AND THE FIRST OF

02:37:43.387 --> 02:37:45.689
ITS KIND RETIREMENT FUND FOR

02:37:45.756 --> 02:37:47.524
FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS IN

02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:50.561
THE NATION. BUT NONE OF THESE

02:37:50.627 --> 02:37:53.630
VICTORIES CAME EASY. EACH

02:37:53.697 --> 02:37:55.465
VICTORY REQUIRED THOUSANDS OF

02:37:55.532 --> 02:37:59.837
HOURS OF UNPAID TIME AND

02:37:59.903 --> 02:38:01.271
BARGAINING SESSIONS. JOINT

02:38:01.338 --> 02:38:03.807
LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES,

02:38:03.874 --> 02:38:05.576
ORGANIZING DRIVES, PHONE CALLS,

02:38:05.642 --> 02:38:08.378
LETTERS, EMAILS, RALLIES AND

02:38:08.445 --> 02:38:10.747
MEETING WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS

02:38:10.814 --> 02:38:14.151
SO THEY COULD UNDERSTAND THE

02:38:14.218 --> 02:38:16.320
WORK WE DO AND ITS IMPORTANCE.

02:38:16.386 --> 02:38:19.256
ALL THE WHILE, WE CONTINUE OUR

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:21.792
DAILY WORK OF EDUCATING AND

02:38:21.859 --> 02:38:22.793

02:38:27.598 --> 02:38:29.299
DRIVERS, HEALTHCARE WORKERS,

02:38:29.366 --> 02:38:31.034
AND SO MANY OTHER ESSENTIAL

02:38:31.101 --> 02:38:34.638
WORKERS. WE EDUCATE, WE NOURISH,

02:38:34.705 --> 02:38:37.975
WE COMFORT, AND WE GUIDE THEM,

02:38:38.041 --> 02:38:40.611
OFTEN WORKING FROM BEFORE DAWN

02:38:40.677 --> 02:38:44.514
UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT. BUT EVEN

02:38:44.581 --> 02:38:47.417
WITH ALL OF OUR GAINS, WE STILL

02:38:47.484 --> 02:38:50.254
ABSORB THE RISING COST OF FOOD,

02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.956
UTILITIES AND SUPPLIES WHILE

02:38:53.023 --> 02:38:53.590
SUBSIDIZING THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM

02:38:53.657 --> 02:38:55.325
MEANT TO SUPPORT FAMILIES WHO

02:38:55.392 --> 02:38:58.528
NEED IT MOST. YEAH, WE ARE A

02:38:58.595 --> 02:39:00.264
MOVEMENT THAT'S BEEN

02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:01.932
GENERATIONS IN THE MAKING AND

02:39:01.999 --> 02:39:05.302
WE WILL KEEP MOVING FORWARD. WE

02:39:05.369 --> 02:39:06.536
WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR WAGES

02:39:06.603 --> 02:39:08.972
THAT REFLECT THE TRUE COST OF

02:39:09.039 --> 02:39:11.742
CARE, FOR THE BENEFITS THAT

02:39:11.808 --> 02:39:13.310
HONOR OUR HUMANITY, AND FOR A

02:39:13.377 --> 02:39:15.245
FUTURE WHERE FAMILY CHILDCARE

02:39:15.312 --> 02:39:17.080
IS RECOGNIZED AS THE RESPECTED

02:39:17.147 --> 02:39:19.549
PROFESSION THAT IT IS. WE'RE

02:39:19.616 --> 02:39:21.551
GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT OF

02:39:21.618 --> 02:39:23.387
SOME OF OUR STATE LEADERS THAT

02:39:23.453 --> 02:39:25.789
HAVE SHOWN FOR CHILDCARE

02:39:25.856 --> 02:39:27.324
PROVIDERS, AND WE HOPE TO

02:39:27.391 --> 02:39:28.525
CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ALL

02:39:28.592 --> 02:39:31.862
AND WITH THE STATE AS WE MOVE

02:39:31.929 --> 02:39:33.330
FORWARD. FINALLY, ESTABLISHING

02:39:33.397 --> 02:39:35.499
TRUE COST OF CARE RATES,

02:39:35.565 --> 02:39:38.302
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE WILL

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:40.837
ALLOW OUR PROGRAMS, FAMILIES

02:39:40.904 --> 02:39:43.840
AND COMMUNITIES TO TRULY THRIVE.

02:39:43.907 --> 02:39:44.708
THAT IS THE FUTURE MY MOTHER

02:39:44.775 --> 02:39:49.279
DREAMT OF. AND IT IS A FUTURE I

02:39:49.346 --> 02:39:51.748

I DIDN'T START WITH THIS, BUT

02:40:02.759 --> 02:40:04.628
ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE'VE

02:40:04.695 --> 02:40:06.163
BEEN TALKING ABOUT CHILDCARE

02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.531
FOR EIGHT YEARS AT LEAST, I'VE

02:40:07.597 --> 02:40:09.433

02:40:22.546 --> 02:40:25.282
IN HAVING THIS DISCUSSION. AND

02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:26.450
IT SHOULDN'T BE A TOUGH

02:40:26.516 --> 02:40:27.651

THINGS, WHAT'S THE MOST

02:40:30.654 --> 02:40:31.588
REWARDING THING IS BRINGING A

02:40:31.655 --> 02:40:32.789

THAT I ALWAYS SHARE WITH PEOPLE

02:41:35.018 --> 02:41:36.186
IS THAT WE BRING OUR LIVED

02:41:36.253 --> 02:41:37.287
EXPERIENCES TO THE CAPITOL,

02:41:37.354 --> 02:41:38.455

CHILDREN, I HAVE FOUR

02:41:42.392 --> 02:41:43.693
GODCHILDREN. AND TRUST ME, THEY

02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:45.595
ARE KEEPING US BUSY. WE HAVE

SHARED. AND THOSE EXPERIENCES

02:41:52.402 --> 02:41:53.503
ARE AMAZING. BUT THERE'S A

02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:54.704
LOVED ONE. THERE'S COMPASSION.

02:41:54.771 --> 02:41:55.572

02:41:55.639 --> 02:41:57.474
ARE THAT ARE PROVIDED TO HER.

02:41:57.541 --> 02:41:59.509
AND IT TAKES A TEAM EFFORT, NOT

02:41:59.576 --> 02:42:00.477

FAMILY MEMBERS. AND TRULY, TO

02:42:01.678 --> 02:42:03.647
YOUR POINT, YOU KNOW, THE

02:42:03.713 --> 02:42:05.782
CONVICTION OF OF OF TAKING CARE

02:42:05.849 --> 02:42:07.217
OF THAT CHILD. SO THANK YOU FOR

YOUR EXPERIENCES. THANK YOU FOR

02:42:08.351 --> 02:42:09.619
LIVED EXPERIENCES. AND THE LAST

02:42:09.686 --> 02:42:11.588
COMMENT WAS ABOUT OUR MOTHERS,

02:42:11.655 --> 02:42:13.757
RIGHT? MY MOTHER WAS MY WORLD.

02:42:13.824 --> 02:42:15.625
SO I KNOW THAT IF SHE COULD

02:42:15.692 --> 02:42:17.394
KEEP ME IN A LITTLE CAGE, I CAN

02:42:17.461 --> 02:42:19.463
PROTECT ME. HER WHOLE LIFE. SHE

02:42:19.529 --> 02:42:20.664
WOULD HAVE DONE THAT. BUT SHE

02:42:20.730 --> 02:42:22.199
SAID, THIS LITTLE BIRD HERE

02:42:22.265 --> 02:42:23.533
FLEW AWAY AND LIVED THE WORLD

02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:25.235
AND EXPERIENCE THE WORLD. SO

02:42:25.302 --> 02:42:27.237
THAT BEING SAID, I KNOW THAT TO

02:42:27.304 --> 02:42:28.438
OUR MOMS SPECIFICALLY, OF

02:42:28.505 --> 02:42:29.339
COURSE, OUR FATHERS TOO. BUT

02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:31.608
OUR MOMS WERE SOMETHING THAT WE

02:42:31.675 --> 02:42:32.509
WERE THEIR TREASURE. SO I KNOW

02:42:32.576 --> 02:42:34.578
I WANT TO COMMEND ALL AMAZING

02:42:34.644 --> 02:42:35.479
WOMEN OUT THERE THAT TAKE CARE

02:42:35.545 --> 02:42:36.646
OF THEIR CHILDREN, BECAUSE I

02:42:36.713 --> 02:42:38.682
WAS ONE OF THOSE CHILDS THAT I

02:42:38.748 --> 02:42:40.317
WAS ALREADY PROTECTED BY, BY BY,

02:42:40.383 --> 02:42:41.651
YOU KNOW, BY MY MOM AND, AND

02:42:41.718 --> 02:42:43.487
JUST WANT TO UPLIFT THOSE

02:42:43.553 --> 02:42:44.321
VOICES ARE STRONG WOMEN OUT

02:42:44.387 --> 02:42:45.522

CHAIR. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:42:47.524 --> 02:42:48.058
CONTINUING THESE DISCUSSIONS.

02:42:48.125 --> 02:42:49.292
AND AGAIN, LOVE THE PANEL. LOVE

02:42:49.359 --> 02:42:50.594

THAT YOU ALL HAVE FOR FOR

02:42:52.362 --> 02:42:54.931
OTHERS. GRACIAS. YES. WHO ELSE?

02:42:54.998 --> 02:42:56.666
GO AHEAD. CHAIR. CHAIR. THANK

02:42:56.733 --> 02:42:59.503
YOU. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR

02:42:59.569 --> 02:43:03.273
STORY. AND ALL OF YOU ACTUALLY

02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:05.475
FOR SPEAKING. I HAD A CHANCE TO

02:43:05.542 --> 02:43:07.244
ACTUALLY TOUR MORE LEARNING

02:43:07.310 --> 02:43:10.514
PRESCHOOL AND LEARN SOMETHING.

02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:11.748
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:43:11.815 --> 02:43:14.151
YOU HAD MENTIONED IS THAT WHEN

02:43:14.217 --> 02:43:16.486
WE PUT ONE OF THE AREAS AND IT

02:43:16.553 --> 02:43:19.789
WAS BEFORE ME HERE, IS THAT WE

02:43:19.856 --> 02:43:21.291
PUT FORTH TK RIGHT, UNIVERSAL

02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:26.263
TK AND WHILE IT WAS A GREAT

02:43:26.329 --> 02:43:28.965
THING AND WE WANTED CHILDREN TO

02:43:29.032 --> 02:43:30.667
BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THAT, IT

02:43:30.734 --> 02:43:32.669
ACTUALLY HARMED CENTERS LIKE

02:43:32.736 --> 02:43:36.006
YOURS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

02:43:36.072 --> 02:43:37.607
WAS DISCUSSED HERE, THAT WHEN

02:43:37.674 --> 02:43:40.377
WE MADE THIS SOMETHING FOR THE

02:43:40.443 --> 02:43:41.645
COMMUNITY, WHAT IT ACTUALLY DID

02:43:41.711 --> 02:43:43.346
WAS IT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS MANY

02:43:43.413 --> 02:43:46.483
OF THESE CENTERS. WHERE THEY

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:48.218
GOT IT WAS BASICALLY MONEY

02:43:48.285 --> 02:43:50.620
TAKEN AWAY. AND THEN HEARING

02:43:50.687 --> 02:43:52.622
NOW THAT THERE'S CONVERSATIONS

02:43:52.689 --> 02:43:56.626
ABOUT EVEN INFANT CARE AS WELL

02:43:56.693 --> 02:43:57.494
TOO, RIGHT, IS WHAT YOU SHARED

02:43:57.561 --> 02:43:59.529
WITH ME. AND I HADN'T HAD A

02:43:59.596 --> 02:44:01.298
CHANCE TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT

02:44:01.364 --> 02:44:02.566
THAT. BUT IF THAT COMES INTO

02:44:02.632 --> 02:44:04.701
PLACE, IT WOULD INDEFINITELY

02:44:04.768 --> 02:44:07.504
SHUT DOWN ALL CENTERS. AND SO

02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:10.173
I'M NOT SURE, MADAM CHAIR, IF

02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:11.541
YOU HEARD THAT AT ALL. IF

02:44:11.608 --> 02:44:13.443
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:15.545
TALKED ABOUT YEARS AGO WHEN

02:44:15.612 --> 02:44:17.447
THIS CAME INTO THE CONVERSATION,

02:44:17.514 --> 02:44:20.617
BUT ALSO IT WAS IT WAS NEWS TO

02:44:20.684 --> 02:44:22.619
ME. AND I APPRECIATE THAT TOUR

02:44:22.686 --> 02:44:24.387
COMPLETELY BECAUSE I LEARNED SO

02:44:24.454 --> 02:44:26.856
MUCH FROM YOU. AND JUST SEEING

02:44:26.923 --> 02:44:28.058
THAT THAT CENTER, I'D ALWAYS

02:44:28.124 --> 02:44:29.492
TOUR THE HOME BASE, CHILD CARE

02:44:29.559 --> 02:44:30.560
CENTERS AND KNEW THAT THEY WERE

02:44:30.627 --> 02:44:32.562
STRUGGLING. AND AND I ALWAYS

02:44:32.629 --> 02:44:33.430
THOUGHT THESE CENTER BASED ONES

02:44:33.496 --> 02:44:34.598
WERE DOING REALLY, REALLY WELL.

02:44:34.664 --> 02:44:37.267
BUT THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY

02:44:37.334 --> 02:44:38.335
EXPLAIN TO ME THE DIFFERENCE

02:44:38.401 --> 02:44:40.270
AND THEN TOLD ME ABOUT THAT,

02:44:40.337 --> 02:44:41.538
THEN IT WAS ONE OF THOSE AREAS

02:44:41.605 --> 02:44:43.540
WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE

02:44:43.607 --> 02:44:45.609
TO DO A ROUNDTABLE TO BRING YOU

02:44:45.675 --> 02:44:46.409
ALL TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT HOW

02:44:46.476 --> 02:44:48.511
DO WE MAKE IT WHOLE AGAIN?

02:44:48.578 --> 02:44:50.046
BECAUSE IF WE TOOK SOMETHING

02:44:50.113 --> 02:44:51.248
AWAY FROM YOU, YOU WE HAVE TO

02:44:51.314 --> 02:44:52.515
BE ABLE TO COME BACK AND

02:44:52.582 --> 02:44:53.717
REPLACE THAT WITH SOMETHING

02:44:53.783 --> 02:44:55.252
ELSE AND NOT JUST KEEP TAKING

02:44:55.318 --> 02:44:56.586
MORE AND MORE AWAY. AND SO I

02:44:56.653 --> 02:44:59.089
DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN CHAT ABOUT

02:44:59.155 --> 02:45:00.657
THAT, IF YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT

02:45:00.724 --> 02:45:01.591
THAT OR IF ANYBODY HERE ON THE

02:45:01.658 --> 02:45:03.727
PANEL CAN ALSO WEIGH IN ON THAT

02:45:03.793 --> 02:45:04.661
AS WELL TOO, BECAUSE THAT

02:45:04.728 --> 02:45:05.662
WASN'T DISCUSSED, HOW THAT

02:45:05.729 --> 02:45:07.530
REALLY IMPACTED MANY OF YOUR

02:45:07.597 --> 02:45:08.465
CENTERS. AND I THINK IT'S NOT

02:45:08.531 --> 02:45:10.400
JUST YOUR CENTERS, BUT ALSO ANY

02:45:10.467 --> 02:45:11.701
OF THE HOME BASED CENTERS AS

02:45:11.768 --> 02:45:13.703
WELL, TOO. IT TOOK AWAY, I WANT

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:14.571
TO SAY, HALF OF THEIR INCOME

02:45:14.638 --> 02:45:17.307
MORE THAN ANYTHING. AND I THINK

02:45:17.374 --> 02:45:19.509
THAT THIS IS WHERE I CAN ADD

02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:21.211
THIS ON TO ANOTHER ONE OF OUR

02:45:21.278 --> 02:45:22.245
WORKSHOP MEETINGS THAT WE

02:45:22.312 --> 02:45:23.413
SHOULD TALK ABOUT INFANT CARE

02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:25.448
AND HOW THAT AFFECTS, YOU KNOW,

02:45:25.515 --> 02:45:27.250
WE WE DO POLICY, RIGHT, AND WE

02:45:27.317 --> 02:45:28.718
THINK THAT WE'RE DOING THE

02:45:28.785 --> 02:45:29.886
RIGHT THING. AND SOMETIMES WE

02:45:29.953 --> 02:45:31.454
MAKE A MISTAKE, UNINTENDED

02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:33.990
CONSEQUENCES. SO WE GOING TO

02:45:34.057 --> 02:45:35.525
HAVE TO REEVALUATE SOME OF THIS

02:45:35.592 --> 02:45:36.359
STUFF. WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE

02:45:36.426 --> 02:45:40.597
TO. SO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COLLINS

02:45:40.664 --> 02:45:44.167
OKAY, I WAS TRYING TO GET BACK

02:45:44.234 --> 02:45:47.637
TO HERE Y'ALL. BUT I'M HERE AND

02:45:47.704 --> 02:45:49.306
I WILL GO BACK TO REPLAY TO

02:45:49.372 --> 02:45:51.341
WATCH AND MAKE SURE THAT I

02:45:51.408 --> 02:45:52.409
DOCUMENT EVERYTHING ELSE FROM

02:45:52.475 --> 02:45:53.510
WHAT YOU GUYS WERE SAYING. I DO

02:45:53.576 --> 02:45:55.312
WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR

DIVISION, WE'VE ISSUED OUT A

02:46:17.434 --> 02:46:18.501
AFFORDABILITY REPORT THAT IS

02:46:18.568 --> 02:46:20.570
HIGHLIGHTING CHILDCARE. AND IN

02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:23.406
THAT IN THAT REPORT, WE DID

02:46:23.473 --> 02:46:24.574
HIGHLIGHT FOUR DIFFERENT KEY

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:25.775
AREAS FOR US TO ACTUALLY

02:46:25.842 --> 02:46:27.911

IT TALKED ABOUT, OF COURSE, THE

02:46:32.716 --> 02:46:34.351
KEY ISSUES OF HIGH COST, BUT

02:46:34.417 --> 02:46:36.753
ALSO THE THE LACK OF ACCESS.

02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:38.421
BUT EVEN DIVING DEEPER NOW,

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:39.522
GOING FURTHER INTO THE QUALITY

02:46:39.589 --> 02:46:41.424
OF PAY, THE STATE, THE STATE

02:46:41.491 --> 02:46:42.492
EFFORTS AND THEN THE CALWORKS

02:46:42.559 --> 02:46:44.661
PROGRAM. SO KNOW THAT EVEN

02:46:44.728 --> 02:46:46.863
THOUGH WE'RE WE'RE HAVING, YOU

02:46:46.930 --> 02:46:47.630
KNOW, HEARING HERE AND THERE

02:46:47.697 --> 02:46:48.631
THAT THE CONVERSATION IS

02:46:48.698 --> 02:46:50.934
ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH DEEP

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.635
AND DEPTH BREADTH OF OF

02:46:52.702 --> 02:46:53.670
RESEARCH THAT IS ALSO FOLLOWING

02:46:53.737 --> 02:46:55.905
THAT. AND YOU GUYS ARE ADDING

02:46:55.972 --> 02:46:56.940
TO THAT PARTICULAR RESEARCH TO

02:46:57.006 --> 02:46:58.742
ENSURE THAT WE GET THE THINGS

02:46:58.808 --> 02:47:01.211
THAT WE NEED. AS I MENTIONED

02:47:01.277 --> 02:47:03.413
FROM THE LAST, FROM THE LAST

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:04.914
PANEL TO I'M ONE OF THOSE

02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:05.782
PEOPLE THAT FELL INTO THAT

02:47:05.849 --> 02:47:07.650
CATEGORY OF THE MIDDLE, YOU

02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:08.585
KNOW, AND NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:47:08.651 --> 02:47:10.320
FIND CHILDCARE FOR MY SON. I

02:47:10.387 --> 02:47:11.654
MEAN, I FOUND SOMETHING, BUT,

02:47:11.721 --> 02:47:13.523
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T EXACTLY

02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:14.758
WHAT I WANTED, BUT HEY, HE'S

02:47:14.824 --> 02:47:16.693
HERE. HE'S GOOD. RIGHT? BUT

02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:19.195
THAT ACTUALLY PUSHED ME TO WANT

02:47:19.262 --> 02:47:20.697
TO SERVE ON EARLY EDUCATION

02:47:20.764 --> 02:47:23.032
BOARDS. AND SO I DID SERVE ON

02:47:23.099 --> 02:47:25.301
AN EARLY BOARD FOR ABOUT ABOUT

02:47:25.368 --> 02:47:27.237
SIX YEARS. AND ON THAT BOARD, I

02:47:27.303 --> 02:47:29.305
TRULY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE

02:47:29.372 --> 02:47:31.241
OF HOW MUCH YOU GUYS GIVE US,

02:47:31.307 --> 02:47:33.243
GIVE OF YOURSELVES, YOU KNOW,

02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:34.677
MEANING YOU CARRY SO MUCH, YOU

02:47:34.744 --> 02:47:36.646
TAKE ON SO MUCH, YOU HAVE YOUR

02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:37.881
OWN PERSONAL CHALLENGES. YOU

02:47:37.947 --> 02:47:38.748
KNOW, YOUR OWN KIDS, YOUR

02:47:38.815 --> 02:47:40.450
FAMILIES, BUT THEN YOU'RE

02:47:40.517 --> 02:47:41.785
CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF OTHERS.

02:47:41.851 --> 02:47:43.486
SAME THING FOR WHAT WE DO. SO

02:47:43.553 --> 02:47:44.754
AND THEN FROM THERE, YOU HAVE

02:47:44.821 --> 02:47:46.756
TO REGROUP AND COME BACK AND

02:47:46.823 --> 02:47:47.624
STILL PROVIDE A SERVICE. PEOPLE

02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:49.559
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT, THAT

02:47:49.626 --> 02:47:50.527
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THIS WORK,

02:47:50.593 --> 02:47:52.395
IT'S NOT JUST YOUR FAMILY.

02:47:52.462 --> 02:47:53.930
YOU'RE CARING FOR THE WHOLE

02:47:53.997 --> 02:47:54.697
CHILD, YOU'RE CARING FOR THE

02:47:54.764 --> 02:47:56.699
ENTIRE FAMILY. AND THAT IS THAT

02:47:56.766 --> 02:47:57.700
IS A LOT THAT COMES WITH THIS

02:47:57.767 --> 02:47:59.369
WORK. AND I WOULDN'T BE HERE,

02:47:59.436 --> 02:48:00.503
HONESTLY, IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU

02:48:00.570 --> 02:48:02.705
ALL, FOR THE WORK, FOR WHAT YOU

02:48:02.772 --> 02:48:04.641
GUYS HAVE DONE. I DID HAVE

02:48:04.707 --> 02:48:05.442
EARLY EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE, BUT

02:48:05.508 --> 02:48:07.510
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

02:48:07.577 --> 02:48:08.611
CANNOT AFFORD IT. AND I

02:48:08.678 --> 02:48:09.546
REMEMBER SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE

02:48:09.612 --> 02:48:10.480
FORMERLY INCARCERATED WHO SAID

02:48:10.547 --> 02:48:12.615
THAT THE ONE THING THAT I WISH

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:14.551
I HAD TO ENSURE THAT I WOULD

02:48:14.617 --> 02:48:15.552
HAVE BEEN ON TRACK WAS EARLY

02:48:15.618 --> 02:48:17.220
CHILDHOOD CARE. SO YOU GUYS

02:48:17.287 --> 02:48:19.556
PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN PEOPLE'S

02:48:19.622 --> 02:48:20.690
LIVES AND QUALITY OF LIVES, AND

02:48:20.757 --> 02:48:22.392
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

02:48:22.459 --> 02:48:24.561
AND JUST THE LAST POINT FROM ME

02:48:24.627 --> 02:48:26.229
SERVING ON THAT BOARD, WE WE

02:48:26.296 --> 02:48:27.397
TALKED ABOUT WAGE INCREASES

02:48:27.464 --> 02:48:28.698
BEFORE. OTHERS WAS TALKING

02:48:28.765 --> 02:48:30.633
ABOUT TRYING TO INCREASE THE

02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:31.534
WAGES. WE TALKED ABOUT FAMILY

02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:32.936
FEES AND SLOTS BEING

02:48:33.002 --> 02:48:34.504
REIMBURSEMENT. BUT ONE THING

02:48:34.571 --> 02:48:36.773
THAT THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE EVEN

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:38.475
MORE OF IMPORTANCE RIGHT NOW IS

02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:39.742
FOR NATURAL DISASTERS AND

02:48:39.809 --> 02:48:41.311
SUPPORTS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING,

02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:43.546
WILDFIRES, FLOODS OR WHATEVER,

02:48:43.613 --> 02:48:44.414
AND THEN THE INSURANCE SUPPORT.

02:48:44.481 --> 02:48:46.416
SO FOR YOU GUYS TO BE ABLE TO

02:48:46.483 --> 02:48:48.251
BE ABLE TO NOW COME BACK IN AND

02:48:48.318 --> 02:48:49.986
GET THE FUNDING THAT YOU NEED

02:48:50.053 --> 02:48:51.521
TO REBUILD, AND THAT'S ALSO

02:48:51.588 --> 02:48:52.789
BEEN AN ACTUAL HUGE CONCERN. SO

02:48:52.856 --> 02:48:54.424
I'M SEEING ALL THIS TO SAY, I

02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:56.626

02:48:58.628 --> 02:48:59.395
CHAMPIONS HERE WITH ALL OF US

02:48:59.462 --> 02:49:01.431
THAT ARE HERE. AND THANK YOU

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:02.732

02:49:02.799 --> 02:49:03.600
YOUR STORIES ONCE AGAIN HELPS

02:49:03.666 --> 02:49:05.568
TO SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. AND

02:49:05.635 --> 02:49:07.270
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE, TO

02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:09.038
SERVE THE STATE AND TO HEAR

02:49:09.105 --> 02:49:11.174
FROM YOU ALL. SO THANK YOU AND

THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK

02:49:16.646 --> 02:49:17.413
YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:19.516
CONVENING THIS COMMITTEE. I'M

02:49:19.582 --> 02:49:21.384
VERY PROUD AND PRIVILEGED TO BE

02:49:21.451 --> 02:49:24.420
ON IT. AND I'M JUST SO MOVED BY

02:49:24.487 --> 02:49:27.390
ALL THE TESTIMONY TODAY ABOUT

02:49:27.457 --> 02:49:29.526
MAKING SURE WE HAVE CULTURALLY

02:49:29.592 --> 02:49:31.528
COMPETENT CARE. AND ONE THING

02:49:31.594 --> 02:49:34.731
THAT STUCK OUT IN TERMS OF HOW,

02:49:34.797 --> 02:49:35.665
YOU KNOW, BILLIONAIRES DON'T

02:49:35.732 --> 02:49:37.634
HAVE TO STAND IN LINE HERE AND

02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:40.370
BEG FOR THE TAX BREAKS. AND,

02:49:40.436 --> 02:49:42.672
YOU KNOW, WE SEE LINES OF WOMEN

02:49:42.739 --> 02:49:43.506
WRAPPING AROUND BUILDINGS. YOU

02:49:43.573 --> 02:49:45.341
KNOW, I'VE BEEN IN GOVERNMENT

02:49:45.408 --> 02:49:46.643
FOR A LONG TIME IN SAN

02:49:46.709 --> 02:49:48.278
FRANCISCO AND HERE. AND JUST

02:49:48.344 --> 02:49:50.446
HOW MANY? NOT JUST THE LINES,

02:49:50.513 --> 02:49:52.549
BUT THE YEARS OF HAVING TO

02:49:52.615 --> 02:49:53.917
ADVOCATE FOR SOMETHING THAT

02:49:53.983 --> 02:49:56.519
SEEMS SO BASIC. I'M A MOM. I

02:49:56.586 --> 02:49:58.821
HAVE A 20 YEAR OLD SON AND A 16

02:49:58.888 --> 02:50:00.924
YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, AND I

02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:01.457
REMEMBER THE STRUGGLES OF

02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:03.359
CHILDCARE AND GETTING BACK INTO

02:50:03.426 --> 02:50:04.694
MY CAREER AND HOW I WAS GOING

02:50:04.761 --> 02:50:06.329

IN TERMS OF THE UNINTENDED

02:50:25.348 --> 02:50:26.849
CONSEQUENCES OF TRYING TO DO

02:50:26.916 --> 02:50:28.618
SOMETHING GOOD, BUT WE NEED TO

02:50:28.685 --> 02:50:30.353

TALKING ABOUT TC, ESPECIALLY, I

02:51:41.924 --> 02:51:43.459
THINK, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:45.528
MANY OF US THAT STOOD IN THOSE

02:51:45.595 --> 02:51:46.429
LONG LINES TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

02:51:46.496 --> 02:51:48.531
WE KNEW WOULD HAPPEN IF WE

02:51:48.598 --> 02:51:50.667
DIDN'T REALLY LOOK AT A TRUE

02:51:50.733 --> 02:51:53.436
MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR TC

02:51:53.503 --> 02:51:55.204
AND, YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE THAT

02:51:55.271 --> 02:51:56.739
WE INCLUDED ALL TYPES OF

02:51:56.806 --> 02:51:57.473
PROVIDERS. YOU KNOW, IN

02:51:57.540 --> 02:51:59.609
CALIFORNIA, WE SAY THAT WE HAVE

02:51:59.676 --> 02:52:00.543
A VALUE, THAT WE WANT PARENTS

02:52:00.610 --> 02:52:02.612
TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE TYPE

02:52:02.679 --> 02:52:04.280
OF CARE THAT WORKS BEST FOR

02:52:04.347 --> 02:52:06.382
THEIR FAMILY, WHICH MEANS AT

02:52:06.449 --> 02:52:08.985
ALL AGES. RIGHT? BUT THE

02:52:09.052 --> 02:52:10.453
REALITY, YOU SAID IT IN YOUR

02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:12.555
TESTIMONY, RIGHT? WHERE THE THE

02:52:12.622 --> 02:52:14.390
PARENTS HAVE NO CHOICE, THEY

02:52:14.457 --> 02:52:16.793
HAVE TO USE TC BECAUSE THAT'S

02:52:16.859 --> 02:52:18.394
THAT'S FREE. RIGHT. AND SO IF

02:52:18.461 --> 02:52:20.596
THAT'S YOUR ONLY CHOICE, THAT'S

02:52:20.663 --> 02:52:22.565
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. RIGHT?

02:52:22.632 --> 02:52:23.466
IT'S NOT BECAUSE WHAT THAT'S

02:52:23.533 --> 02:52:26.502
WHAT MAYBE THEY THINK OR WANT

02:52:26.569 --> 02:52:27.770
OR KNOW IS BEST FOR THEIR

02:52:27.837 --> 02:52:30.807
FAMILY, BUT IT'S WHAT THEY HAVE

02:52:30.873 --> 02:52:35.578
TO DO, RIGHT. SO I JUST WANT TO

02:52:35.645 --> 02:52:36.412

MAJORITY LEADER DID SAY AS YOU

02:54:06.702 --> 02:54:08.371
CONVERSATION AROUND UNIVERSAL

02:54:08.437 --> 02:54:10.573
PRE-K THAT WE WOULD CONVENE

KNOWING WHAT WE DID AND THE

02:54:22.552 --> 02:54:23.519
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I

02:54:23.586 --> 02:54:25.388
DON'T THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:54:25.454 --> 02:54:27.390
MOVING INFANTS OUT, KNOWING

02:54:27.456 --> 02:54:28.891
THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT

02:54:28.958 --> 02:54:29.392
HAPPENED ALREADY, RIGHT?

02:54:29.458 --> 02:54:30.493
LEARNING FROM FROM THE PAST.

02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:32.695
BUT I DO WANT TO BRING THAT

02:54:32.762 --> 02:54:34.697
BACK UP AGAIN AND MAYBE FIX

02:54:34.764 --> 02:54:36.532
SOME OF THOSE AREAS THAT WE

02:54:36.599 --> 02:54:37.466
THOUGHT WAS A GOOD THING. AND

02:54:37.533 --> 02:54:39.468
TO YOUR POINT ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

02:54:39.535 --> 02:54:40.636

02:54:40.703 --> 02:54:42.672
CHOOSE IT'S FREE OR THEY HAVE

02:54:42.738 --> 02:54:44.507
TO PAY. AND OF COURSE, I WOULD

02:54:44.574 --> 02:54:45.641
TAKE SOMETHING FREE, TOO. I'LL

02:54:45.708 --> 02:54:47.276
TAKE IT TEN TIMES FREE IF I

02:54:47.343 --> 02:54:49.378
COULD. RIGHT. AND SO I THINK

02:54:49.445 --> 02:54:51.280
BRINGING THAT BACK AGAIN AND

02:54:51.347 --> 02:54:52.348

OF US AS RESOURCES TO GROW THE

02:56:52.835 --> 02:56:55.104
SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED, AS

02:56:55.171 --> 02:56:56.939
WELL AS OUR WORKFORCE, WHILE

02:56:57.006 --> 02:56:58.808
EXPANDING CARE. OUR FAMILIES

02:56:58.874 --> 02:57:00.876
AND CHILDREN HAVE CONTINUED TO

02:57:00.943 --> 02:57:02.311
CARRY THE BURDEN, AND WE ARE

02:57:02.378 --> 02:57:03.946
RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING THEIR

02:57:04.013 --> 02:57:07.316
NEEDS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

02:57:07.383 --> 02:57:10.619
MADELINE FOREMAN OF CALIFORNIA,

02:57:10.686 --> 02:57:11.520
SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF EARLY

02:57:11.587 --> 02:57:13.656
CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS THROUGH OUR

02:57:13.723 --> 02:57:16.292
GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY ARM, EVERY

02:57:16.359 --> 02:57:18.427
CHILD CALIFORNIA IS Â VOICES

02:57:18.494 --> 02:57:21.664
WE BRING ON, WE BRING ON THE

02:57:21.731 --> 02:57:22.431
GROUND EARLY CHILDHOOD

02:57:22.498 --> 02:57:23.499
EDUCATORS TOGETHER.

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:25.101
PARTICIPATION IS OPEN

02:57:25.167 --> 02:57:26.569
REGARDLESS OF ASSOCIATION

02:57:26.635 --> 02:57:27.703
MEMBERSHIP, BECAUSE OUR

02:57:27.770 --> 02:57:29.805
LEADERSHIP WANTED TO ENSURE ALL

02:57:29.872 --> 02:57:31.807
EDUCATORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO

02:57:31.874 --> 02:57:33.476
MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:36.512
AFFORD FORMAL REPRESENTATION,

02:57:36.579 --> 02:57:38.314
STILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE.

02:57:38.381 --> 02:57:40.383
RECENTLY, OUR TEAM INTERVIEWED

02:57:40.449 --> 02:57:41.384
ONE SUCH EDUCATOR AND ASKED

02:57:41.450 --> 02:57:43.452
WHAT MESSAGE SHE WANTED MOST

02:57:43.519 --> 02:57:45.521
CONVEYED TO LEGISLATORS. HER

02:57:45.588 --> 02:57:48.657
REPLY WHY THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT

02:57:48.724 --> 02:57:52.461
US. WE KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE

02:57:52.528 --> 02:57:54.697
SERVE IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:57:54.764 --> 02:57:56.699
BECAUSE THEY CARE DEEPLY. BUT

02:57:56.766 --> 02:57:58.701
HER WORDS REFLECTED A SYSTEMIC

02:57:58.768 --> 02:58:00.336
GAP. HISTORICALLY, THERE HASN'T

02:58:00.403 --> 02:58:02.304
BEEN A DESIGNATED SPACE FOR THE

02:58:02.371 --> 02:58:04.306
REALITIES OF EARLY CHILDHOOD

02:58:04.373 --> 02:58:05.908
EDUCATION AND THE COST

02:58:05.975 --> 02:58:08.077
PRESSURES WITHIN TO BE CENTERED

02:58:08.144 --> 02:58:10.046
IN POLICY CONVERSATIONS. THANK

02:58:10.112 --> 02:58:12.581
YOU, CO-CHAIRS, FOR STEPPING UP

02:58:12.648 --> 02:58:14.250
AND CHANGING THE SYSTEM AND

02:58:14.316 --> 02:58:16.385
CREATING THAT SPACE. IT IS NOT

02:58:16.452 --> 02:58:18.654
ONLY CONVEYS THAT POLICY MAKERS

02:58:18.721 --> 02:58:20.556
CARE, IT DEMONSTRATES IT. THANK

02:58:20.623 --> 02:58:22.491
YOU SO MUCH. WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:58:22.558 --> 02:58:24.727
WORKING WITH THE MEMBERS AND

02:58:24.794 --> 02:58:25.928
STAFF ON THIS SELECT COMMITTEE.

02:58:25.995 --> 02:58:29.932
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD

02:58:29.999 --> 02:58:30.699
AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF

02:58:30.766 --> 02:58:33.436
THE COMMITTEE. I'M BARBARA

02:58:33.502 --> 02:58:35.271
SCHMITZ. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF

02:58:35.337 --> 02:58:36.439
FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA. I WANT

02:58:36.505 --> 02:58:38.641
TO THANK YOU, FIRST OF ALL, FOR

02:58:38.707 --> 02:58:40.443
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS

02:58:40.509 --> 02:58:41.477
DEEP CONVERSATION, SOMETHING

02:58:41.544 --> 02:58:43.679
THAT'S VERY FOCUSED. OBVIOUSLY,

02:58:43.746 --> 02:58:45.414
YOU KNOW, GIVEN THE TESTIMONY

02:58:45.481 --> 02:58:47.516
AND THEN I PRESUME SOME THINGS

02:58:47.583 --> 02:58:49.952
THAT WILL WILL BE SAID AFTER ME.

02:58:50.019 --> 02:58:51.554
YOU UNDERSTAND THE THE NEED AND

02:58:51.620 --> 02:58:54.356
THE DESPERATE HOPE THAT WE'VE

02:58:54.423 --> 02:58:56.625
ALL HAD THAT THIS CONVERSATION

02:58:56.692 --> 02:58:58.294
WOULD OCCUR. SO THANK YOU. I

02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:01.464
JUST WANT TO MENTION, YOU KNOW,

02:59:01.530 --> 02:59:02.965
OUR ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSED ON

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:04.433
MAKING SURE THAT CHILDREN 0 TO

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:05.968
5 HAVE ALL THOSE ESSENTIAL

02:59:06.035 --> 02:59:07.269
SERVICES SO THAT THEY CAN

02:59:07.336 --> 02:59:09.371
THRIVE IN A SAFE, STABLE AND

02:59:09.438 --> 02:59:11.240
NURTURING ENVIRONMENT AND IN

02:59:11.307 --> 02:59:13.442
SORT OF COALESCING SOME OF THE

02:59:13.509 --> 02:59:15.044
CONVERSATIONS AND THE DATA THAT

02:59:15.111 --> 02:59:16.345
CAME FORWARD TODAY. ONE OF THE

02:59:16.412 --> 02:59:18.380
THINGS THAT I WANTED TO UPLIFT

02:59:18.447 --> 02:59:21.150
IS EQUITY. AND SO I THINK WE

02:59:21.217 --> 02:59:22.485
HAVE FOCUSED AND NEED TO

02:59:22.551 --> 02:59:24.954
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EQUITY, ON

02:59:25.020 --> 02:59:26.355
THE PROVIDER SIDE, ON THE

02:59:26.422 --> 02:59:28.491
PARENT SIDE, BUT ALSO ON THE

02:59:28.557 --> 02:59:30.192
CHILD SIDE. AND SO I JUST

02:59:30.259 --> 02:59:31.427
WANTED TO UPLIFT A COUPLE OF

02:59:31.494 --> 02:59:33.929
AREAS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

02:59:33.996 --> 02:59:35.598
OVERLOOKED. AND THOSE ARE

02:59:35.664 --> 02:59:37.500
CHILDREN WHO NEED CARE. FOR

02:59:37.566 --> 02:59:40.302
EXAMPLE, IN MIGRANT FAMILIES,

02:59:40.369 --> 02:59:41.871
CHILDREN WHO NEED CARE IN

02:59:41.937 --> 02:59:44.273
NONTRADITIONAL OUR SETTINGS,

02:59:44.340 --> 02:59:46.475
CHILDREN WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS

02:59:46.542 --> 02:59:48.210
JUST WANTED TO UPLIFT AND MAKE

02:59:48.277 --> 02:59:49.578
SURE THAT WE SHINE A LITTLE BIT

02:59:49.645 --> 02:59:51.881
OF A LIGHT ON THEM AS WE'RE

02:59:51.947 --> 02:59:53.415
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION, SO

02:59:53.482 --> 02:59:54.683
THAT THEY DON'T GET OVERLOOKED

02:59:54.750 --> 02:59:57.319
AND THEIR NEEDS CONTINUE TO BE

02:59:57.386 --> 02:59:59.822
UNMET. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

02:59:59.889 --> 03:00:01.790
GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S JUST SUCH

03:00:01.857 --> 03:00:03.459
A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH ALL

03:00:03.526 --> 03:00:05.261
OF YOU WHO HAVE SUCH A

03:00:05.327 --> 03:00:06.762
COMMITMENT TO THE EARLY CARE

03:00:06.829 --> 03:00:07.496
AND EDUCATION FIELD. I'VE BEEN

03:00:07.563 --> 03:00:09.598
DOING THIS FOR A VERY, VERY

03:00:09.665 --> 03:00:11.500
LONG TIME, AND I'M A PRODUCT OF

03:00:11.567 --> 03:00:14.003
A HIGH SCHOOL ROP PROGRAM WHERE

03:00:14.069 --> 03:00:14.770
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF

03:00:14.837 --> 03:00:16.539
WORKING IN A TEEN PARENTING

03:00:16.605 --> 03:00:18.574
PROGRAM, WHERE I GOT MY FIRST

03:00:18.641 --> 03:00:20.609
OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE

03:00:20.676 --> 03:00:22.478
MAGIC OF EARLY CARE AND

03:00:22.545 --> 03:00:23.579
EDUCATION, AND WHAT THE

03:00:23.646 --> 03:00:24.880
INFLUENCE OF AN EARLY EDUCATOR

03:00:24.947 --> 03:00:27.917
HAS ON A CHILD'S LIFE. IT IS

03:00:27.983 --> 03:00:28.484
WHERE I HAD MY COMMITMENT TO

03:00:28.551 --> 03:00:30.586
THE FIELD. THAT WAS IN THE TIME

03:00:30.653 --> 03:00:33.322
WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAD REGIONAL

03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:34.423
OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAMS AND

03:00:34.490 --> 03:00:35.724
CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION

03:00:35.791 --> 03:00:37.493
PROGRAMS THAT FOCUSED ON CAREER

03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:39.328
READINESS, WHERE OUR HIGH

03:00:39.395 --> 03:00:41.230
SCHOOLERS CAN LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL

03:00:41.297 --> 03:00:44.867
AND BE JOB READY. SO IN

03:00:44.934 --> 03:00:46.235
ADDITION TO NEEDING A TRUE COST

03:00:46.302 --> 03:00:47.903
OF CARE IN A REIMBURSEMENT

03:00:47.970 --> 03:00:50.239
SYSTEM THAT ACTUALIZES THE TRUE

03:00:50.306 --> 03:00:52.575
COST OF CHILDCARE, ALL OF THOSE

03:00:52.641 --> 03:00:54.577
ISSUES ARE ALSO HURTING OUR

03:00:54.643 --> 03:00:55.844
WORKFORCE. THEY'RE BLEEDING AT

03:00:55.911 --> 03:00:57.413
THE SEAMS. WE'VE BEEN BLEEDING

03:00:57.479 --> 03:00:59.148
AT THE SEAMS FOR QUITE SOME

03:00:59.215 --> 03:01:00.583
TIME. THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN

03:01:00.649 --> 03:01:02.418
OUR WORKFORCE CONTINUES TO BE A

03:01:02.484 --> 03:01:05.354
BARRIER TO THIS HOLISTIC SYSTEM.

03:01:05.421 --> 03:01:07.656
I THINK AS A STATE, WE NEED TO

03:01:07.723 --> 03:01:09.425
THINK ABOUT EARLY CARE AND

03:01:09.491 --> 03:01:10.459
EDUCATION AS PART OF THE

03:01:10.526 --> 03:01:12.428
OVERALL EDUCATION SYSTEM, AND

03:01:12.494 --> 03:01:15.464
WE NEED TO QUIT SEGREGATING Â

03:01:15.531 --> 03:01:17.266
FROM THE ENTIRE EDUCATION

03:01:17.333 --> 03:01:19.568
PLATFORM THAT WE RETHINK, THAT

03:01:19.635 --> 03:01:21.637
OUR TEACHER PATHWAYS, OUR

03:01:21.704 --> 03:01:22.538
TEACHER RECRUITMENT. WE MAKE IT

03:01:22.605 --> 03:01:25.140
PART OF THE K-12 RECRUITMENT

03:01:25.207 --> 03:01:27.376
SYSTEM. I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT

03:01:27.443 --> 03:01:28.978
NOT JUST THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

03:01:29.044 --> 03:01:30.246
HAVING IN CALIFORNIA, WITH ALL

03:01:30.312 --> 03:01:32.481
THE LACK OF COSTS AND NOT

03:01:32.548 --> 03:01:33.048
HAVING REIMBURSEMENT THAT'S

03:01:33.115 --> 03:01:34.617
PAYING OUR PROGRAMS WHAT THEY

03:01:34.683 --> 03:01:36.252
ACTUALLY NEED TO OPERATE HIGH

03:01:36.318 --> 03:01:38.654
QUALITY PROGRAMS. BUT I'M ALSO

03:01:38.721 --> 03:01:39.822
WORRIED ABOUT THE LONGEVITY OF

03:01:39.888 --> 03:01:42.024
OUR FIELD AND OUR WORKFORCE AND

03:01:42.091 --> 03:01:42.658
THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A

03:01:42.725 --> 03:01:45.628
WHOLE. I DO THINK THAT THERE'S

03:01:45.694 --> 03:01:47.563
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO RETHINK

03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:49.298
THESE THINGS. IF WE WANT TO

03:01:49.365 --> 03:01:50.399
TALK ABOUT MAKING IT MORE

03:01:50.466 --> 03:01:51.634
AFFORDABLE FOR ALL, THERE'S A

03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:53.369
LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS

03:01:53.435 --> 03:01:54.903
THAT COME ALONG WITH STATE

03:01:54.970 --> 03:01:56.205
SUBSIDIZED CARE, THE

03:01:56.272 --> 03:01:58.340
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT COME

03:01:58.407 --> 03:01:59.742
WITH TO EVEN GETTING A PARENT

03:01:59.808 --> 03:02:01.343
THROUGH THE DOOR. RIGHT. SO I

03:02:01.410 --> 03:02:03.812
THINK IF WE WORK AS A AS A

03:02:03.879 --> 03:02:05.214
PARTNER AND COLLECTIVELY, WE

03:02:05.281 --> 03:02:07.883
CAN BE CREATIVE OF REIMAGINING

03:02:07.950 --> 03:02:09.518
WHAT CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION

03:02:09.585 --> 03:02:11.287
SYSTEM CAN TRULY LOOK LIKE,

03:02:11.353 --> 03:02:14.757
THAT WE CAN BE MINDFUL OF SOME

03:02:14.823 --> 03:02:16.759
ADDITIONAL FEARS THAT WE HAVE

03:02:16.825 --> 03:02:19.128
COMING DOWN. NOT ONLY ARE OUR

03:02:19.194 --> 03:02:19.762
EARLY EDUCATORS DO THEY QUALIFY

03:02:19.828 --> 03:02:22.331
FOR THE STATE SUBSIDY FOR THE

03:02:22.398 --> 03:02:23.532
PROGRAMS THAT THEY SERVE. WHEN

03:02:23.599 --> 03:02:25.467
I WAS IN DIRECT SERVICE, I HAD

03:02:25.534 --> 03:02:27.236
28 PROGRAMS AND OVER 300 STAFF,

03:02:27.303 --> 03:02:29.505
AND OVER 80% OF THEM QUALIFIED

03:02:29.571 --> 03:02:31.473
FOR THE SUBSIDY IN WHICH THEY

03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:33.676
WERE WORKING FOR. THAT IS AN

03:02:33.742 --> 03:02:36.412
ISSUE, RIGHT? SO IF WE WANT TO

03:02:36.478 --> 03:02:38.314
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WE NEED

03:02:38.380 --> 03:02:40.582
TO CREATE MORE PATHWAYS. AND WE

03:02:40.649 --> 03:02:42.284
LOOK AT THE TRUMP'S BIG

03:02:42.351 --> 03:02:44.353
BEAUTIFUL BILL THAT JUST

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:46.588
RELEASED NEW REQUIREMENTS OR

03:02:46.655 --> 03:02:48.357
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STUDENT

03:02:48.424 --> 03:02:50.292
LOANS AND EARLY CARE AND

03:02:50.359 --> 03:02:51.827
EDUCATION WOULD NOT QUALIFY TO

03:02:51.894 --> 03:02:54.396
TAKE OUT A STUDENT LOAN BECAUSE

03:02:54.463 --> 03:02:56.899
Â DOES NOT EQUAL A LIVING WAGE.

03:02:56.965 --> 03:02:59.034
SO AS WE THINK ABOUT ALL OF

03:02:59.101 --> 03:03:01.370
THESE ISSUES, OUR WORKFORCE IS

03:03:01.437 --> 03:03:03.572
IS BLEEDING AT THE SEAMS AND WE

03:03:03.639 --> 03:03:04.907
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING IN

03:03:04.973 --> 03:03:07.142
PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU TO ADDRESS

03:03:07.209 --> 03:03:08.510
THESE IN A CREATIVE MANNER.

03:03:08.577 --> 03:03:12.815
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD

03:03:12.881 --> 03:03:13.816
AFTERNOON. CO-CHAIR MEMBERS. MY

03:03:13.882 --> 03:03:16.452
NAME IS MARIAM NØ AND I'M A

03:03:16.518 --> 03:03:18.187
STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE CHILD

03:03:18.253 --> 03:03:19.355
CARE LAW CENTER. WE MUST

03:03:19.421 --> 03:03:21.824
SUPPORT BOTH PROVIDERS AND

03:03:21.890 --> 03:03:23.225
FAMILIES TO CREATE AN EQUITABLE

03:03:23.292 --> 03:03:25.527
SOCIETY WHERE ALL CHILDREN

03:03:25.594 --> 03:03:26.729
RECEIVE ENRICHING, CULTURALLY

03:03:26.795 --> 03:03:29.398
AFFIRMING CHILD CARE. THE STATE

03:03:29.465 --> 03:03:30.532
MUST MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE

03:03:30.599 --> 03:03:32.201
TO PAY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS

03:03:32.267 --> 03:03:34.403
FAIRLY FOR THE TRUE COST OF

03:03:34.470 --> 03:03:36.605
CARE, AND INCREASE THE NUMBER

03:03:36.672 --> 03:03:38.674
OF AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE SPACES

03:03:38.741 --> 03:03:40.676
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ALL OF OUR

03:03:40.743 --> 03:03:42.478
COMMUNITIES WILL SUFFER IF THE

03:03:42.544 --> 03:03:44.980
STATUS QUO IS ALLOWED TO

03:03:45.047 --> 03:03:46.448
CONTINUE. WE MUST ALSO ENSURE

03:03:46.515 --> 03:03:48.884
THAT AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE IS

03:03:48.951 --> 03:03:51.286
NOT TIED TO A SINGLE EMPLOYER

03:03:51.353 --> 03:03:52.721
OR A PERSON'S ABILITY TO TO

03:03:52.788 --> 03:03:54.323
WORK, AS THIS CAN HAVE

03:03:54.390 --> 03:03:56.325
DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON FAMILIES,

03:03:56.392 --> 03:03:58.660
INCLUDING INCLUDING KEEPING

03:03:58.727 --> 03:04:00.829
PEOPLE IN LOW WAGES, LOW WAGE

03:04:00.896 --> 03:04:03.565
JOBS, AND POTENTIALLY TOXIC JOB

03:04:03.632 --> 03:04:07.269
SITUATIONS. CONCERNING FAIR PAY,

03:04:07.336 --> 03:04:09.338
CALIFORNIA'S COST MODEL AND THE

03:04:09.405 --> 03:04:10.439
ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY

03:04:10.506 --> 03:04:11.273
STRUCTURE MUST REFLECT THE

03:04:11.340 --> 03:04:13.442
CHILD CARE PROVIDER'S LIVED

03:04:13.509 --> 03:04:15.611
REALITY AND PUT AN END TO THE

03:04:15.677 --> 03:04:17.312
DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES AND

03:04:17.379 --> 03:04:19.381
REGULATIONS THAT HAVE EXPLOITED

03:04:19.448 --> 03:04:21.216
PROVIDERS FOR DECADES.

03:04:21.283 --> 03:04:23.419
CURRENTLY, THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

03:04:23.485 --> 03:04:25.621
WE THANK THE LEGISLATIVE

03:04:25.687 --> 03:04:26.755
WOMEN'S CAUCUS FOR THEIR

03:04:26.822 --> 03:04:28.524
LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. WE

03:04:28.590 --> 03:04:29.491
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE AND

03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:34.029
TO CONTINUE TO BE LEADERS FOR

03:04:34.096 --> 03:04:34.530
POSITIVE TRANSFORMATION.

03:04:34.596 --> 03:04:37.533
TRANSFORMATION FORMATIVE, OF

ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:04:42.938 --> 03:04:45.374
BEING THE SAME. CALIFORNIA CAN

03:04:45.441 --> 03:04:47.976
STRENGTHEN AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE

03:04:48.043 --> 03:04:49.244
OPTIONS FOR ALL FAMILIES BY

03:04:49.311 --> 03:04:50.512
ENDING THE EXPLOITATION OF

03:04:50.579 --> 03:04:52.448
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND PAYING

03:04:52.514 --> 03:04:54.450

03:04:58.487 --> 03:05:00.456
LATINAS, WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR

03:05:00.522 --> 03:05:01.690
YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ELEVATING

03:05:01.757 --> 03:05:04.493
THE CRITICAL ISSUE WHICH

03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:06.128
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS THE

03:05:06.195 --> 03:05:07.329
COMMUNITY WE REPRESENT. LATINAS

03:05:07.396 --> 03:05:09.431
MAKE UP THE LARGEST SHARE OF

03:05:09.498 --> 03:05:10.666
CALIFORNIA'S WOMEN AND OUR

03:05:10.732 --> 03:05:12.301
MOTHERS TO OVER HALF THE

03:05:12.367 --> 03:05:14.403
CHILDREN IN OUR STATE. SO OUR

03:05:14.470 --> 03:05:15.804
ECONOMIC, SECURITY AND

03:05:15.871 --> 03:05:17.306
CAREGIVING CONDITIONS SHAPE THE

FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING

03:05:18.674 --> 03:05:19.875
TO A NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW

03:05:19.942 --> 03:05:22.544
CENTER, 23% OF CENTER BASED

03:05:22.611 --> 03:05:25.013
CHILDCARE WORKERS AND 16% OF

03:05:25.080 --> 03:05:26.949
HOME BASED CHILDCARE PROVIDERS

03:05:27.015 --> 03:05:28.550
ARE LATINA. BECAUSE LATINAS ARE

03:05:28.617 --> 03:05:30.285
OVERREPRESENTED BOTH AS

03:05:30.352 --> 03:05:31.920
PROVIDERS AND USERS OF

03:05:31.987 --> 03:05:33.622
CHILDCARE, INADEQUATE

03:05:33.689 --> 03:05:35.791
COMPENSATION HAS A DOUBLE

03:05:35.858 --> 03:05:37.292
IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY. PROPER

03:05:37.359 --> 03:05:38.460
COMPENSATION FOR CHILDCARE

03:05:38.527 --> 03:05:40.395
WORKERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE

03:05:40.462 --> 03:05:41.330
LATINAS, MEANS STABILITY FOR

03:05:41.396 --> 03:05:42.831
OUR FAMILIES, CONTINUITY OF

03:05:42.898 --> 03:05:45.000

03:05:45.067 --> 03:05:47.636
MOBILITY FOR WOMEN, LOW PAY FOR

03:05:47.703 --> 03:05:48.537
CHILDCARE PROFESSIONALS

03:05:48.604 --> 03:05:49.605
DEVALUES THE ESSENTIAL LABOR

03:05:49.671 --> 03:05:51.607
THAT ALLOWS A BROADER ECONOMY

03:05:51.673 --> 03:05:54.443
TO FUNCTION. FAIR PAY WOULD

03:05:54.510 --> 03:05:56.512
RECOGNIZE CHILDCARE AS A

03:05:56.578 --> 03:05:57.412
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IT

03:05:57.479 --> 03:05:59.515
IS. STRENGTHENING. CHILDCARE

03:05:59.581 --> 03:06:00.749
COMPENSATION BUILDS A

03:06:00.816 --> 03:06:02.784
SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM THAT

03:06:02.851 --> 03:06:03.418
REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S

03:06:03.485 --> 03:06:05.220
DEMOGRAPHICS AND PREPARES OUR

03:06:05.287 --> 03:06:06.355
CHILDREN FOR THE FUTURE. SO

03:06:06.421 --> 03:06:09.191
AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

03:06:09.258 --> 03:06:09.825
YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THANK YOU,

03:06:09.892 --> 03:06:11.960
ALL, COMMITTEE MEMBERS, FOR

03:06:12.027 --> 03:06:13.929
YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR STATE.

03:06:13.996 --> 03:06:17.666
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY

NAME IS SYLVIA HERNANDEZ. THANK

YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO BE HERE.

03:06:20.569 --> 03:06:22.571
I AM A CHILD CARE PROVIDER,

03:06:22.638 --> 03:06:24.439
EARLY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR

03:06:24.506 --> 03:06:26.642
AS WELL FOR AND I'M PART OF CPU.

03:06:26.708 --> 03:06:29.111
BUT THE URGENCY THAT WE HAVE

03:06:29.177 --> 03:06:30.445
FOR THE RATE OF DEFORMATION IS

03:06:30.512 --> 03:06:33.115
BECAUSE AS IT IS, WE NEED OUR

03:06:33.181 --> 03:06:34.683
HELP WITH OUR ASSISTANCE. WE

03:06:34.750 --> 03:06:38.020
HAVE 65% OF OUR WAGES GO TO OUR

03:06:38.086 --> 03:06:39.488
EMPLOYEES. AND AND IT'S HURTING

03:06:39.555 --> 03:06:40.822
BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE

03:06:40.889 --> 03:06:42.324
PROFESSIONALS. THEY HAVE THEIR

03:06:42.391 --> 03:06:43.792
DEGREES, AND THERE'S NO WAY

03:06:43.859 --> 03:06:46.295
THAT WE'RE GOING TO PAY THEM

03:06:46.361 --> 03:06:47.462
BELOW MINIMUM WAGE. THIS IS AN

03:06:47.529 --> 03:06:49.598
URGENCY THAT WE DO HAVE FOR OUR

03:06:49.665 --> 03:06:51.433
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. I AM A 24

03:06:51.500 --> 03:06:54.303

03:06:54.369 --> 03:06:55.504
AND I NEED THE STAFF TO GIVE

03:06:55.571 --> 03:06:57.639
HIGH QUALITY CARE. AND THIS IS

03:06:57.706 --> 03:06:59.408
NOT JUST TAKING CARE OF THE

03:06:59.474 --> 03:07:00.475
CHILDREN, BUT EDUCATING THE

03:07:00.542 --> 03:07:02.711
CHILDREN AS WELL. SO THIS IS AN

03:07:02.778 --> 03:07:04.446
URGENCY THAT WE DO HAVE AND WE

03:07:04.513 --> 03:07:06.281
DO PLEAD FOR, YOU KNOW, OVER

03:07:06.348 --> 03:07:08.617
62,000 PROVIDERS THAT WE DO

03:07:08.684 --> 03:07:10.419
REPRESENT, THAT WE NEED THIS

03:07:10.485 --> 03:07:12.454
REFORMATION OF RATES BECAUSE

03:07:12.521 --> 03:07:14.323
IT'S REALLY HURTING US. AND I

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:15.591
REALLY DO NOT WOULD LIKE TO

03:07:15.657 --> 03:07:17.192
CLOSE MY DOORS TO PARENTS WHO

03:07:17.259 --> 03:07:18.594
ARE HAVING TO GO TO SCHOOL TO

03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:21.730
DO A BETTER CAREER, HAVE A

03:07:21.797 --> 03:07:23.332
BETTER JOB. SOME OF THEM ARE

03:07:23.398 --> 03:07:25.000
WORKING 2 TO 3 JOBS JUST TO

03:07:25.067 --> 03:07:26.668
MAKE ENDS MEET. SO THIS IS A

03:07:26.735 --> 03:07:29.504
REALLY URGENCY. AND I AM A BIG

03:07:29.571 --> 03:07:30.839
BELIEVER THAT, YOU KNOW, THINGS

03:07:30.906 --> 03:07:33.342

COME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT

03:07:52.561 --> 03:07:53.929
WHY WE NEED AN IMPLEMENT, AN

03:07:53.996 --> 03:07:54.763
ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY BASED

03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:56.565
ON THE TRUE COST OF CARE. BY

03:07:56.632 --> 03:07:58.400
HAVING THIS METHOD, WE WILL SAY

03:07:58.467 --> 03:07:59.468

FAMILIES. TRUE COST OF CARE

03:08:04.473 --> 03:08:05.774
RATES WOULD HELP PROVIDERS LIKE

03:08:05.841 --> 03:08:07.409
ME TO BE ABLE TO STOP USING OUR

03:08:07.476 --> 03:08:09.678
SAVINGS. LIKE MYSELF, I HAVE TO

03:08:09.745 --> 03:08:12.314
BORROW MORE THAN 18 TO $20,000

TO OPERATE AND PROVIDE HIGH

03:08:13.682 --> 03:08:14.716
QUALITY CARE. THAT INCLUDES

03:08:14.783 --> 03:08:16.718
SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION, HOME

03:08:16.785 --> 03:08:18.453
COOKED MEALS, AND EDUCATIONAL

03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:19.421
ACTIVITIES. AS SOMEONE WHO

03:08:19.488 --> 03:08:21.923
WORKS 24 OVER SEVEN, WE CANNOT

03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:23.592
CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER

03:08:23.659 --> 03:08:25.560
OUTDATED MARKET RATES. PARENTS

THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTHY

03:08:32.934 --> 03:08:34.403
DEVELOPMENT, BUT I FIND IT VERY

03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:36.471
DIFFICULT WITH INFLATION. I

03:08:36.538 --> 03:08:38.373

MOVED TO A MORE AFFORDABLE

03:08:39.775 --> 03:08:41.276

03:08:41.343 --> 03:08:43.378
I HAVE TO SCALE BACK HOURS AND

03:08:43.445 --> 03:08:44.646
EXPENSES TO KEEP MY ASSISTANTS

CAN CONTINUE TO AFFORD PAYING

03:08:47.449 --> 03:08:48.784
MY ASSISTANCE. WE NEED

STABILITY FOR PROVIDERS AND OUR

03:08:49.718 --> 03:08:51.453
FAMILIES THAT WE WORK WITH. I

FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

03:08:55.891 --> 03:08:57.492

03:08:57.559 --> 03:08:58.760
ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY TO STOP

03:08:58.827 --> 03:09:00.462

IMPORTANT. I WANT TO COME AND

03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:40.762
AM A HOME CHILD CARE PROVIDER

03:10:40.829 --> 03:10:43.632
AND EDUCATOR. TWO OF MY MOST

03:10:43.698 --> 03:10:45.300
BEAUTIFUL STORIES ARE THAT

03:10:45.367 --> 03:10:46.568
THERE WAS A FATHER WHO LOST HIS

03:10:46.635 --> 03:10:48.837
JOB, AND HE WAS ABLE TO USE THE

03:10:48.904 --> 03:10:51.973
SERVICES AND HIS CHILD DIDN'T

03:10:52.040 --> 03:10:54.342
SPEAK WELL. UNFORTUNATELY, THE

03:10:54.409 --> 03:10:56.611
CHILD THEY LEFT FOR FREE TC

03:10:56.678 --> 03:10:58.446
THIS YEAR, THEY TOLD ME LAST

03:10:58.513 --> 03:11:00.582
WEEK, BUT THE CHILD IS SPEAKING.

03:11:00.649 --> 03:11:01.783
THE CHILD IS JUST EVOLVED LIKE

03:11:01.850 --> 03:11:03.485
A BUTTERFLY, RIGHT? YOU SEE THE

03:11:03.552 --> 03:11:04.686
CATERPILLAR AND YOU SEE THE

03:11:04.753 --> 03:11:06.354
BUTTERFLY EVOLVE. THAT CHILD IS

03:11:06.421 --> 03:11:07.389
JUST BLOSSOMED AND BLOOMED. I

03:11:07.455 --> 03:11:09.791
HAD ANOTHER CHILD WHO'S ON THE

03:11:09.858 --> 03:11:11.626
SPECTRUM THAT THEY HAD THEIR

03:11:11.693 --> 03:11:13.829
IEP AND THEY JUST NEEDED LIKE

03:11:13.895 --> 03:11:15.630
RIGHT EVERYWHERE, RIGHT

03:11:15.697 --> 03:11:17.399
BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS. THAT

03:11:17.465 --> 03:11:19.668
CHILD ALSO GAVE ME THIS SUDDEN

03:11:19.734 --> 03:11:21.369
NOTICE. THE PARENTS SAID, OH,

03:11:21.436 --> 03:11:23.505
THEY'RE GOING INTO FREE TC. THE

03:11:23.572 --> 03:11:25.407
CHILD IS TAKEN. BUT THE CHILD

03:11:25.473 --> 03:11:26.908
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM DAY

03:11:26.975 --> 03:11:28.677
ONE TO NOW. WHEN THE PARENT

03:11:28.743 --> 03:11:30.512
TOOK THE CHILD AND I ASKED BOTH

03:11:30.579 --> 03:11:32.480
PARENTS, YOU KNOW, WHY ARE YOU

03:11:32.547 --> 03:11:33.748
TAKING THEM? THE SINGLE MOTHER

03:11:33.815 --> 03:11:35.817
HAD TOLD ME, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS

03:11:35.884 --> 03:11:37.552
PROGRAM ALLOWS ME TO SUPPORT MY

03:11:37.619 --> 03:11:39.454
CHILD ALL ON MY OWN. I DON'T

03:11:39.521 --> 03:11:41.089
HAVE TO GET EXTRA SUPPORT. SHE

03:11:41.156 --> 03:11:42.490
HAS HER OWN APARTMENT BECAUSE

03:11:42.557 --> 03:11:44.492
OF THIS PROGRAM, AND THE FATHER

03:11:44.559 --> 03:11:46.628
HAD JUST LOST HIS JOB. SO HIS

03:11:46.695 --> 03:11:47.762
FAMILY WERE THEY WERE IN DIRE

03:11:47.829 --> 03:11:49.531
STRAITS. SO THE PROGRAM HELPED.

03:11:49.598 --> 03:11:52.267
BUT I ABSORBED THE COST. AND

03:11:52.334 --> 03:11:55.370
AND I LOVE THIS JOB. I MEAN, MY

03:11:55.437 --> 03:11:56.571
MOTHER IN LAW HELPS HERE. AND

03:11:56.638 --> 03:11:58.540
SO WE SERVE THEM LIKE THESE

03:11:58.607 --> 03:12:00.775
NUTRITIOUS, VEGGIE FILLED FOODS.

03:12:00.842 --> 03:12:02.577
AND AND THE PARENTS EVEN BRAG

03:12:02.644 --> 03:12:04.579
ABOUT, OH, MY KIDS EAT ALL

03:12:04.646 --> 03:12:05.380
THESE VEGETABLES. AND THE

03:12:05.447 --> 03:12:07.349
COUSINS HAVE TO EAT ALL THIS

03:12:07.415 --> 03:12:09.017
PROCESSED FOOD. BUT YOU GUYS,

03:12:09.084 --> 03:12:09.551
YOU DON'T DO THE THE HOME

03:12:09.618 --> 03:12:11.486
COOKED MEALS AND SO THEY CAN

03:12:11.553 --> 03:12:12.621
BRAG ABOUT IT. BUT THOSE

03:12:12.687 --> 03:12:14.055
VEGETABLES COST MONEY. SO I

03:12:14.122 --> 03:12:15.390
HAVE DEPLETED MY SAVINGS. I USE

03:12:15.457 --> 03:12:17.959
MY CREDIT CARDS TO TO PAY FOR

03:12:18.026 --> 03:12:19.327
THE EXPENSES. I HAD TO LET GO

03:12:19.394 --> 03:12:22.530
OF ONE OF MY TEACHERS AND SHE

03:12:22.597 --> 03:12:24.532
ACTUALLY GOT A BETTER PAYING

03:12:24.599 --> 03:12:26.401
JOB BECAUSE SHE'S A GREAT

03:12:26.468 --> 03:12:27.469
TEACHER, BECAUSE SHE HAD ALL

03:12:27.535 --> 03:12:31.573
THIS EXPERIENCE. AND SO THAT'S

03:12:31.640 --> 03:12:32.407
WHY I'M ASKING YOU GUYS TO

03:12:32.474 --> 03:12:34.509

KEEP THIS UP, THEN WE CAN

03:12:57.599 --> 03:12:59.401
CHANGE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS

03:12:59.467 --> 03:13:00.902

THE UPCOMING CONVERSATION ON TK.

03:16:10.358 --> 03:16:12.494
WE THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

03:16:12.560 --> 03:16:13.595
OPPORTUNITY WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE

03:16:13.661 --> 03:16:14.496
PARTNERSHIPS AND EXPLORING WAYS

03:16:14.562 --> 03:16:16.631
THAT WE CAN REALLY MAXIMIZE

03:16:16.698 --> 03:16:18.700
DOLLARS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

03:16:18.766 --> 03:16:19.400
ALLOCATED. WHICH LEADS ME TO

03:16:19.467 --> 03:16:21.870
POINT NUMBER TWO, LOOKING

SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE, AS WELL

03:16:30.712 --> 03:16:33.314

THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT,

03:16:35.783 --> 03:16:36.818
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO

03:16:36.885 --> 03:16:38.553
LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE. SO AS

03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:40.989
WE LOOK FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS,

03:16:41.055 --> 03:16:42.690
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO

03:16:42.757 --> 03:16:44.692
IDENTIFYING THOSE AREAS AND

03:16:44.759 --> 03:16:48.062
SEEING HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE

03:16:48.129 --> 03:16:48.863
THAT THE MONEY GETS SPENT.

03:16:48.930 --> 03:16:52.333
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD

03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:53.835
AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

03:16:53.902 --> 03:16:55.970
MY NAME IS JULIET TERRY. I'M

03:16:56.037 --> 03:16:56.538
WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE

03:16:56.604 --> 03:16:58.573
CENTER. WE'RE A LARGE RESOURCE

03:16:58.640 --> 03:16:59.307
AND REFERRAL AGENCY. WE SERVE

03:16:59.374 --> 03:17:00.975
LOS ANGELES AND SAN BERNARDINO

03:17:01.042 --> 03:17:02.644
COUNTIES. I HAD A LIST OF

03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:04.412
REALLY SMART THINGS TO SAY, BUT

03:17:04.479 --> 03:17:06.414
I WOULD ACTUALLY JUST LIKE TO

03:17:06.481 --> 03:17:08.716
GIVE A ME TOO. AND A DITTO AND

03:17:08.783 --> 03:17:09.484
A SUPPORT AND STAND IN

03:17:09.551 --> 03:17:11.219
SOLIDARITY FOR ALL OF OUR OTHER

03:17:11.286 --> 03:17:12.320
PARTNERS IN THE COALITION THE

03:17:12.387 --> 03:17:13.521
VOICES OF THE PROVIDERS, THE

03:17:13.588 --> 03:17:14.589
PARENTS, THE FAMILIES, THE

03:17:14.656 --> 03:17:16.057
CHILDREN THEY MATTER THE MOST

03:17:16.124 --> 03:17:18.293
IN THIS, AS A FORMER CHILD CARE

03:17:18.359 --> 03:17:19.460
PROVIDER WHO LEFT THE FIELD DUE

03:17:19.527 --> 03:17:21.729
TO LOW WAGES, AND I'M NOW DOING

03:17:21.796 --> 03:17:22.597
THIS WORK AS SOMEBODY WHO'S

03:17:22.664 --> 03:17:24.899
ALSO WAITING TO HAVE A FAMILY

03:17:24.966 --> 03:17:26.201
BECAUSE OF AFFORDABILITY ISSUES.

03:17:26.267 --> 03:17:28.403
THIS THIS CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

03:17:28.469 --> 03:17:30.238
YOU ALL KNOW THAT. I'LL LIFT UP

03:17:30.305 --> 03:17:31.472
JUST A COUPLE MORE POINTS. I

03:17:31.539 --> 03:17:34.108
KNOW EARLIER KEISHA MENTIONED

03:17:34.175 --> 03:17:35.710
THAT FAMILY CHILD CARE

03:17:35.777 --> 03:17:37.579
PROVIDERS. I'M SORRY. ALEXA

03:17:37.645 --> 03:17:38.846
MENTIONED THAT FAMILY CHILD

03:17:38.913 --> 03:17:40.248
CARE PROVIDERS LEAVE THE FIELD

03:17:40.315 --> 03:17:41.583
AT ONE AT A RATE ONE PROVIDER

03:17:41.649 --> 03:17:44.085
PER HOUR. OVERALL, ALL

03:17:44.152 --> 03:17:46.354
PROVIDERS BY DAY WE LOSE ABOUT

03:17:46.421 --> 03:17:47.622
NINE PROVIDERS A DAY OVERALL,

03:17:47.689 --> 03:17:49.257
AND THAT MEANS WE'RE LOSING

03:17:49.324 --> 03:17:50.325
ACCESS TO AT LEAST 96 CHILD

03:17:50.391 --> 03:17:52.827
CARE SLOTS A DAY. OBVIOUSLY,

03:17:52.894 --> 03:17:55.663
THE WAGES ARE A HUGE IMPEDIMENT

03:17:55.730 --> 03:17:57.932
TO THE SUCCESS. IT SHOULD BE A

03:17:57.999 --> 03:17:59.634
VALUED PROFESSION AND RESPECTED

03:17:59.701 --> 03:18:01.970
AS SUCH. AND LASTLY, ON THE

03:18:02.036 --> 03:18:03.338
ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY, IF WE

03:18:03.404 --> 03:18:05.406
FAIL TO CONTINUE IN ITS

03:18:05.473 --> 03:18:07.675
ADOPTION, WORKING TO BUILD A

03:18:07.742 --> 03:18:08.676
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

03:18:08.743 --> 03:18:10.845
ASPIRATIONAL AND NOT WORKING

03:18:10.912 --> 03:18:12.480
WITHIN CONSTRAINTS, WE MUST DO

03:18:12.547 --> 03:18:14.482
THIS TO AVOID HARMING FAMILIES

03:18:14.549 --> 03:18:15.783
AND PROVIDERS FURTHER. AND WE

03:18:15.850 --> 03:18:17.518
NEED ACTION NOW TO STABILIZE

03:18:17.585 --> 03:18:18.620
OUR WORKFORCE AND OUR SYSTEMS,

03:18:18.686 --> 03:18:19.787
AND MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA

03:18:19.854 --> 03:18:22.657
IS AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE.

03:19:01.329 --> 03:19:02.497
ECOSYSTEM, AS THEY'RE THE NEXUS

03:19:02.563 --> 03:19:05.033

03:20:13.101 --> 03:20:15.670
AFTERNOON, ALICIA HATFIELD WITH

03:20:15.737 --> 03:20:17.739
EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA JUST

03:20:17.805 --> 03:20:19.841
HERE TO PROVIDE A ME TOO, FOR

03:20:19.907 --> 03:20:20.742
ALL THE POINTS PREVIOUSLY

03:20:20.808 --> 03:20:21.542
BROUGHT UP. THE OTHER THING

03:20:21.609 --> 03:20:23.444
THAT I HAVEN'T QUITE HEARD YET

03:20:23.511 --> 03:20:26.614
IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE TIME THAT

03:20:26.681 --> 03:20:28.549
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS HAVE TO

03:20:28.616 --> 03:20:30.518
TAKE IN ORDER TO TRACK

03:20:30.585 --> 03:20:31.386
ELIGIBILITY FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

03:20:31.452 --> 03:20:33.488
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE TO

03:20:33.554 --> 03:20:34.589
PROVE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE KIDS.

03:20:34.655 --> 03:20:35.823
THEY JUST GET THE CARE THAT

03:20:35.890 --> 03:20:37.525
THEY NEED. BUT THAT'S NOT THE

03:20:37.592 --> 03:20:39.627
SAME. THAT'S NOT ON PARITY FOR

03:20:39.694 --> 03:20:41.295
CHILDCARE. SO JUST WANTED TO

03:20:41.362 --> 03:20:42.497
HIGHLIGHT THAT. THANK YOU SO

03:20:42.563 --> 03:20:43.498

03:20:43.564 --> 03:20:45.566

INTRODUCE ASSEMBLYMEMBER

PATRICK AARONS TO SAY A FEW

03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:50.905
WORDS IF YOU'D LIKE. THANK YOU

03:20:54.342 --> 03:20:55.443
EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE. AND

03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:56.677
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE

03:20:56.744 --> 03:20:58.646
TESTIMONY. I THINK IT IS

03:20:58.713 --> 03:20:59.447
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

03:20:59.514 --> 03:21:01.816
CONTINUE TO SHINE LIGHT ON

03:21:01.883 --> 03:21:04.719
THESE ISSUES, DESPITE HOW

03:21:04.786 --> 03:21:06.387
DIFFICULT OUR BUDGET SITUATION

03:21:06.454 --> 03:21:09.824
IS FOR THIS YEAR AND THE AND

03:21:09.891 --> 03:21:11.325
THE AND THE COMING YEARS. WE

03:21:11.392 --> 03:21:13.561
CAN'T WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO

03:21:13.628 --> 03:21:17.365
IGNORE OUR OBLIGATION TO HELP

03:21:17.432 --> 03:21:19.534
MAINTAIN AND INCREASE OUR SLOTS

03:21:19.600 --> 03:21:23.037
FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. BUT

03:21:23.104 --> 03:21:24.739
ALSO, I REPRESENT SILICON

03:21:24.806 --> 03:21:27.708
VALLEY. I'M A NEWLY ELECTED,

03:21:27.775 --> 03:21:31.712
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT NOWHERE

03:21:31.779 --> 03:21:34.215
IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR

03:21:34.282 --> 03:21:36.851
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS FELT MORE

03:21:36.918 --> 03:21:39.454
THAN THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING

03:21:39.520 --> 03:21:41.856
AREA IN THE STATE, WHICH IS IN

03:21:41.923 --> 03:21:45.359
MY DISTRICT, AND TO BE POOR IN

03:21:45.426 --> 03:21:50.498
SILICON VALLEY IS IS FELT

03:21:50.565 --> 03:21:53.100
HARDER THAN I WOULD ARGUE IN

03:21:53.167 --> 03:21:55.470
MOST OTHER PLACES IN THE STATE.

03:21:55.536 --> 03:21:59.373
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SEEN

03:21:59.440 --> 03:22:02.443
A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN CHILD

03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:06.414
CARE, CHILDCARE CENTERS IN MY

03:22:06.481 --> 03:22:08.382
DISTRICT, WE'VE RECEIVED SO

03:22:08.449 --> 03:22:10.485
MANY CLOSURES BECAUSE OF THE

03:22:10.551 --> 03:22:12.720
HIGH COST OF LIVING, BECAUSE OF

03:22:12.787 --> 03:22:14.722
HOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO

03:22:14.789 --> 03:22:16.724
OPERATE AND THE COST OF LIVING

03:22:16.791 --> 03:22:17.992
IN SILICON VALLEY. WE ARE

03:22:18.059 --> 03:22:20.394
FEELING THIS SOONER THAN MOST

03:22:20.461 --> 03:22:21.929
AREAS, AND WE'RE FEELING IT

03:22:21.996 --> 03:22:24.265
MORE ACUTELY. AND THERE'S OFTEN

03:22:24.332 --> 03:22:26.467
A MISCONCEPTION THAT, OH,

03:22:26.534 --> 03:22:28.002
YOU'RE FROM SILICON VALLEY.

03:22:28.069 --> 03:22:29.370
EVERYONE'S DOING FINE. LOS

03:22:29.437 --> 03:22:31.439
ANGELES NEEDS YOUR HELP.

03:22:31.506 --> 03:22:32.740
CENTRAL VALLEY NEEDS YOUR HELP.

03:22:32.807 --> 03:22:36.277
ALL OF WHICH IS TRUE. BUT I

03:22:36.344 --> 03:22:38.679
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I ADD

03:22:38.746 --> 03:22:41.782
THE VOICE OF OF PEOPLE REALLY

03:22:41.849 --> 03:22:43.518
STRUGGLING IN SILICON VALLEY

03:22:43.584 --> 03:22:45.620
AND THAT NOT EVERYONE IS DOING

03:22:45.686 --> 03:22:47.555
GREAT. AND THERE'S OFTEN A TALE

03:22:47.622 --> 03:22:49.557
OF TWO CITIES ABOUT THE

03:22:49.624 --> 03:22:52.460
STRUGGLING FAMILIES THAT ARE

03:22:52.527 --> 03:22:54.595
REALLY HURTING FOR CHILD CARE.

03:22:54.662 --> 03:22:56.564
AND INDEED, I JUST WANT TO PUT

03:22:56.631 --> 03:22:58.966
IN THE RECORD. ACCORDING TO THE

03:22:59.033 --> 03:22:59.967
PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF

03:23:00.034 --> 03:23:01.702
CALIFORNIA, POVERTY AMONG

03:23:01.769 --> 03:23:02.236
FAMILIES WITH PRESCHOOLERS

03:23:02.303 --> 03:23:05.773
WOULD BE 24% LOWER IF ALL THOSE

03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:06.541
CHILDREN HAD ACCESS TO

03:23:06.607 --> 03:23:10.578
SUBSIDIZED CARE, 24% LOWER. SO

03:23:10.645 --> 03:23:12.647
ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IS NOT

03:23:12.713 --> 03:23:14.782
JUST A GOOD THING TO DO. IT'S

03:23:14.849 --> 03:23:16.918
NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT WE

03:23:16.984 --> 03:23:18.252
PROMISED WE WOULD DO. IT

03:23:18.319 --> 03:23:19.921
ACTUALLY ADDRESSES

03:23:19.987 --> 03:23:22.590
AFFORDABILITY. IT ACTUALLY

03:23:22.657 --> 03:23:25.660
ADDRESSES POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA.

03:23:25.726 --> 03:23:28.462
AND SO THIS IS NOT JUST THE

03:23:28.529 --> 03:23:30.498
MORAL THING TO DO. THIS IS GOOD

03:23:30.565 --> 03:23:32.567
FOR THE ECONOMY. AND I THINK WE

03:23:32.633 --> 03:23:34.635
NEED TO BE MAKING THAT ARGUMENT

03:23:34.702 --> 03:23:36.437
MUCH MORE LOUDER, BECAUSE WE

03:23:36.504 --> 03:23:38.873
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE
