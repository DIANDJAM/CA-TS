JOINING US AND ALL OF YOU AND

00:46:58.348 --> 00:47:02.085
EVERY ONE OF OUR HEARINGS ARE

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:04.555
VERY SERIOUS. AND THE ISSUES

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:06.557
THAT WE DISCUSS ARE ALWAYS VERY

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:09.960
PRESSING AND PRESCIENT. THIS

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:11.228
ONE IS PARTICULARLY SOBERING, I

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:13.764
WILL SAY. AND WHENEVER YOU'RE

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.465
TALKING ABOUT WORKERS IN OUR

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:19.770
STATE SUFFERING DEATH OR BEING

00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:21.205
MAIMED AT THE WORKPLACE, I

00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:24.174
THINK WE ALL PAUSE AND WE ALL

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:28.579
TAKE A BEAT AND. TAKE A MOMENT

00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:30.214
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.548
BETTER. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.116
WE'RE HERE. I THINK THAT'S WHY

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.484
WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION. I

00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:36.420
WANT TO THANK CHAIR ORTEGA FOR

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:38.121
BRINGING THIS AUDIT REQUEST

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:40.657
LAST YEAR, WHICH WAS MUCH

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:43.560
NEEDED. AND THE AUDIT THAT WE

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:44.394
ARE DISCUSSING TODAY, AND I

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:46.129
WANT TO THANK OUR STATE AUDITOR,

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.397
MR. PARKS, FOR BEING HERE AND

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:49.633
HIS STAFF AND ALL THE GREAT

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.701
WORK ON THIS AUDIT. THE REPORT

00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:52.236
IS TITLED THE DIVISION OF

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:53.770
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:56.139
PROCESS DEFICIENCIES AND

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:58.275
STAFFING SHORTAGES LIMIT ITS

00:47:58.342 --> 00:47:59.409
ABILITY TO PROTECT WORKERS. AND

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.345
I THINK THAT THAT TITLE REALLY

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:02.813
DRIVES HOME EXACTLY WHY WE'RE

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:04.181
HERE. THIS REPORT CAME ABOUT

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:05.349
BECAUSE OF MEDIA REPORTS

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:07.284
REGARDING HORRIBLE INCIDENTS

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:08.652
OCCURRING AT PLACES OF

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.255
EMPLOYMENT. ONE STORY, WHICH

00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:12.623
WAS TRAGIC, INVOLVED A

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.157
CONSTRUCTION WORKER WHO WAS

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:16.460
CRUSHED BY A FALLING PIPE, AND

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:17.761
HE WAS PERMANENTLY PARALYZED

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:19.363
FROM THE CHEST DOWN. WHAT MADE

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:22.132
THIS EVEN MORE STARTLING TO

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.801
READ WAS THAT CAL OSHA BUREAU

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:25.769
OF INVESTIGATIONS NEVER

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.104
ACTUALLY INVESTIGATED THE

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.406
INCIDENT, BECAUSE THIS MAN DID

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:32.075
NOT DIE, AND BECAUSE HE WAS

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:33.176
MERELY PARALYZED FROM THE CHEST

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:35.345
DOWN, IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY RISE

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.080
TO THE LEVEL OF INVESTIGATION

00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:40.117
FOR CAL OSHA, WHICH, AGAIN, I

00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:42.152
THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:43.420
TO DISCUSS TODAY, AND THAT'S

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:45.522
WHY WE'RE HERE. BUT IT HAS KEPT

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:46.156
GOING. UNFORTUNATELY, LAST

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:48.458
MONTH THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:49.526
HORRIFIC WORKPLACE TRAGEDIES

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:51.695
THAT I HOPE WILL BE FULLY

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.297
INVESTIGATED BY CAL OSHA. ONE

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:56.199
INSTANCE WAS IN VERNON, JUST

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.367
OUTSIDE OF LOS ANGELES, WHERE A

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:59.369
WORKER WHO WAS JUST 19 YEARS

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:02.072
OLD WAS KILLED IN AN INDUSTRIAL

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:03.740
FOOD PROCESSING EQUIPMENT

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:06.910
ACCIDENT. JUST FOR A MOMENT,

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:08.245
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS AND

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:11.281
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS YOUNG MAN.

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:12.683
AND IN ESPARTO, JUST 45 MINUTES

00:49:12.749 --> 00:49:14.418
WEST OF HERE, SEVEN WORKERS

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:16.320
WERE RECENTLY KILLED WHEN A

00:49:16.386 --> 00:49:17.954
WAREHOUSE STORING FIREWORKS

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:19.189
EXPLODED. SOME VICTIMS WERE

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:20.457
LOVING FATHERS AND HUSBANDS.

00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:23.293
TWO WERE JUST 18, BARELY OUT OF

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.562
HIGH SCHOOL, AND ONE PITCHED

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.164
HIS FINAL HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.800
GAME JUST WEEKS BEFORE HE WAS

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:32.102
KILLED. AND HE ACTUALLY LED HIS

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:33.303
TEAM TO A LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.738
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE REAL LIVES.

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:36.373
THESE ARE STORIES. AND ALTHOUGH

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.442
A LOT OF THIS IS NUMBERS AND

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:40.510
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:41.578
ABOUT BUDGETS AND STAFFING,

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:42.512
THESE ARE THESE ARE OUR FAMILY

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:44.815
MEMBERS. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:45.649
OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND WE

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:48.051
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:49.753
PROTECTING EVERY WORKER IN THE

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.288
STATE. AND I THINK EVERYONE

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:52.556
HERE ON THE DAIS, EVERYONE HERE

00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:53.357
IN THE ROOM, WE'RE ALL

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:54.458
CONCERNED ABOUT WORKER SAFETY.

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.526
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:58.161
THAT WE WANT WORKERS TO HAVE

00:49:58.228 --> 00:49:59.229
SAFE WORKPLACES. WE WANT OUR

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.697
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS TO HAVE

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:02.366
SAFE PLACES WHEN THEY GO TO

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.633
WORK AND WHEN THEY RETURN HOME

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.335
SAFE EVERY DAY. THAT IS THE

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:07.571
GOAL. ALL OF US HERE STRIVE TO

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:10.474
DO THAT INDIVIDUALLY, AND WE IN

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.142
CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY PROUDLY

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:14.411
HAVE SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:16.079
WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:17.447
COUNTRY. AND I LOVE REMINDING

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:19.383
ALL OF MY FRIENDS OUTSIDE OF

00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:20.317
CALIFORNIA THAT WE TAKE CARE OF

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:22.185
OUR WORKERS, AND WE'RE VERY

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:23.387
PROUD ABOUT THAT. AND THAT'S

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:24.588
WONDERFUL AND GREAT. HOWEVER,

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:25.455
THESE PROTECTIONS CAN

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.357
POTENTIALLY BE VIEWED AS BEING

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:29.359
TOOTHLESS WITHOUT ADEQUATE

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:30.193
ENFORCEMENT, AND I THINK THAT

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.295
IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:33.530
GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:35.265
JUST HOW ARE WE ENFORCING THESE

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:37.467
STRINGENT PROTECTIONS? AND THAT

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.102
AGAIN, BRINGS US TO THE THE

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:41.705
REPORT. AND I DO WANT TO THANK,

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:42.472
SENATOR, ASSEMBLY MEMBER ORTEGA,

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:45.275
CHAIRWOMAN OF OUR LABOR

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:46.810
COMMITTEE, FOR BEING SUCH A

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:50.280
STRIDENT ADVOCATE ON THIS VERY

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:53.016
BRIEFLY. AND THEN I'M GOING TO

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.217
TURN IT OVER TO MY VICE CHAIR

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:55.552
AND OUR MADAM CHAIRWOMAN FOR

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:56.586
OPENING REMARKS. THE AUDIT

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:58.221
IDENTIFIES MANY SHORTCOMINGS IN

00:50:58.288 --> 00:51:00.791
CAL OSHA'S INVESTIGATION OF

00:51:00.857 --> 00:51:02.125
WORKPLACE ACCIDENT COMPLAINTS.

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:03.560
THE REPORT QUESTIONED WHETHER

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.495
CAL OSHA HAD SUFFICIENT REASONS

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:07.898
FOR CLOSING MANY WORKPLACE

00:51:07.964 --> 00:51:09.466
COMPLAINTS. THE REPORT ALSO

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.568
QUESTIONED WHY CAL OES SHOULD

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:12.536
NOT CONDUCT ON SITE INSPECTIONS,

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:15.705
WHEN THEY CLEARLY SHOULD HAVE,

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:16.440
AND THE STATE AUDITOR ALSO

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:19.876
FOUND THAT CAL OSHA DID NOT

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:21.244
TIMELY BEGIN INSPECTIONS. UNDER

00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:23.814
STATE LAW, THEY MUST BEGIN

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.514
WITHIN THREE WORKING DAYS.

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:26.283
INSTEAD, IT WAS TAKING WEEKS OR

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:27.884
EVEN MONTHS TO BEGIN AN

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.653
INSPECTION. TODAY, WE'LL BE

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:31.288
DISCUSSING ALL OF THESE

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:33.557
FINDINGS AND MUCH MORE, AND I

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:34.758
HOPE TO HEAR THAT THE

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.393
DEPARTMENT IS TAKING IMMEDIATE

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.228
ACTION TO IMPROVE ITSELF AND

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.763
IMPLEMENT THE STATE AUDITOR'S

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.398
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND AGAIN,

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:42.232
THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE. A FEW

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.400
HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS BEFORE I

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:46.269

00:52:00.116 --> 00:52:00.851
TEN MINUTES FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:01.418

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:02.552
FIVE MINUTES FOR EACH

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.521
PARTICIPANT ON THE THIRD PANEL.

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:06.523

WILL HAVE MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.429

TRYING TO IMPEDE THE HEARING,

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.435
WE WILL CONDUCT AN ORDERLY

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:20.737
MEETING AND WE WILL PAUSE IF WE

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.239
NEED TO. WITH THAT, MR. VICE

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:24.574
CHAIR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:31.047
AN OPENING STATEMENT? YES.

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:33.583
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I

LABOR CHAIR FOR INITIATING THIS

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:43.460
AUDIT. AND OBVIOUSLY, WORKER

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:45.195
SAFETY IS JUST AN AMAZING

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:48.298
PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US. AND FOR

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:50.467
ME, THERE WAS A MAJOR INCIDENT

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:52.402
IN MY DISTRICT WITH REGARD TO

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.404
THE BATTERY STORAGE FIRE. AND

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:57.007
WE MIRACULOUSLY, THERE WERE NOT

00:52:57.073 --> 00:52:59.476
MAJOR INJURIES. BUT IT IS

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:01.678
EXACTLY SITUATIONS LIKE THAT

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:04.214
THAT WE HOPE THE DEPARTMENT

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:06.850
WILL STAY ON AND WILL MAKE SURE

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:08.652
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT BEFORE

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:11.621
THERE IS A TRAGEDY AND BEFORE

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:13.523
THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.759
MAJOR INJURIES. AND FOR ME,

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.060
THIS IS AN INTERSECTION BECAUSE

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:19.362
I HAVE NOT JUST VICE CHAIR, BUT

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:22.132
I SIT ON THE THE SENATE LABOR

00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:23.400
COMMITTEE AND ON THE RULES

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:25.402
COMMITTEE. WE HAVE HAD TWO

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:27.203
CONFIRMATIONS OF OSHA LEADERS,

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.706
AND WE HAVE TRIED TO VET THESE

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:30.674
ISSUES DURING THE CONFIRMATION

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.310
PROCESS AS WELL, TO EXACTLY SEE

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:35.245
WHAT THE PROGRESS IS ON

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:37.347
VACANCIES AND OTHER ISSUES THAT

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:38.515
I KNOW THAT WILL BE AT THE

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:40.283
HEART OF THE HEARING TODAY. SO

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.085
THANK YOU. I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:43.486
THE PRESENTATIONS AND THE

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:46.089
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. SENATOR

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:51.294
LAIRD, CHAIRWOMAN ORTEGA. GOOD

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:53.330
MORNING EVERYONE. THANK YOU,

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:55.432
CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:57.467
COMMITTEE STAFF, FOR PUTTING

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:58.335
TOGETHER THIS HEARING ON THE

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:00.403
AUDIT THAT I REQUESTED LAST

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:03.239
YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:05.442
STATE AUDITOR, MR. PARKS, AND

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:06.276
HIS STAFF, FOR ALL THE WORK

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.378
THEY PUT INTO THIS REPORT. I

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:10.347
ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:12.248
DIRECTOR OSBORN AND CHIEF LEE

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:16.086
FOR YOUR TIME HERE TODAY. YOU

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:18.989
KNOW, I DID REQUEST THIS

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:22.692
HEARING LAST YEAR WHILE I HELD

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:25.362
MY FIRST HEARING AS CHAIR OF

00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:27.764
LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT ON FARM

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:30.333
WORKER SAFETY. AND I REMEMBER

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.168
WHAT I HEARD THAT DAY FROM FARM

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.670
WORKERS WHO WORK UNDER

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.572
EXTREMELY HIGH TEMPERATURES AND

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:37.073
ARE NOT PROVIDED THE PROPER

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.876
PROTECTIONS FROM THEIR BOSSES

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:40.577
WAS NOT JUST INFURIATING, BUT

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:43.213
IT WAS VERY, VERY CONCERNING.

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:45.749
AND WHAT WAS MORE UPSETTING WAS

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:47.317
LEARNING THAT EVEN THOUGH WE

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.419
HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGEST

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.321
LABOR LAWS IN THE COUNTRY, THEY

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:54.357
THEY WERE NOT BEING ENFORCED.

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:59.429
AND SO I ASKED FOR THIS AUDIT,

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:01.231
MADE THE CASE FOR IT, MY

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.266
COLLEAGUES VOTED TO SUPPORT IT.

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:05.335
AND TODAY WE'RE HERE TO LISTEN

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:09.773
TO TO HEAR THE REPORT. AND I

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:12.542
HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS AUDIT HAS

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:15.712
MADE IT VERY CLEAR WHAT I HAVE

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:18.448
KNOWN FOR SOME TIME, AND THAT

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:21.685
IS THAT CAL OSHA IS NOT WORKING.

00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:24.421
AND YES, TODAY WE WILL PROBABLY

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:28.258
HEAR A LOT ABOUT STAFFING, BUT

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:30.560
IN MY OPENING HEARING THE LAST

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:32.295
TIME I HELD THIS, I TALKED

00:55:32.362 --> 00:55:34.397
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE WERE

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:36.066
ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF A BUDGET

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:37.534
SURPLUS WHERE WE HAD MORE MONEY

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.103
THAN WE KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH,

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.305
AND WE WERE CONTRIBUTING A

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:43.506
QUITE A BIG AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:46.209
MONEY INTO THIS DEPARTMENT. AND

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.344
YET ALL I KEPT HEARING ABOUT

00:55:48.411 --> 00:55:52.615
WAS STAFFING. BUT THE SCALE OF

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:55.185
CAL OSHA TASKS, THE LIVES LOST

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:58.421
AND THE DURATION OF THE PROBLEM

00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:00.390
CALLS FOR AN APPROACH BEYOND

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:03.293
JUST STAFFING. SO I HOPE THAT

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:05.428
THAT'S NOT ALL I HEAR FROM THIS

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:08.898
DEPARTMENT TODAY, BECAUSE,

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:13.136
AGAIN, EVEN WHEN CAL OSHA HAD

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:16.706
MORE STAFFING, WE STILL HAD

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:18.174
INSUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT AND

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:20.477
DEATHS ON THE JOB. WHAT WE

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:23.580
REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON IS

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:26.549
STRUCTURAL CHANGE, NOT MORE

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:28.451
LETTERS THAT DO NOTHING TO

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:32.188
PROTECT WORKERS OR SAVE LIVES.

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:34.157
I'D LIKE TO PAINT A PICTURE OF

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:37.327
WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IN MY

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:40.630
OWN DISTRICT, THERE'S A SCRAP

00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:42.532
METAL COMPANY CALLED ALCO IRON

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:45.335
AND METALS. THREE WORKERS HAVE

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.670
DIED THERE IN THE LAST EIGHT

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:51.674
YEARS. RAY ALFARO, ALBERTO

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:55.311
ANAYA, AND MOST RECENTLY, LUIS

00:56:55.378 --> 00:56:58.348
FERNANDO GUERRERO. A FEW WEEKS

00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:01.417
AGO, I MET WITH LUIS, HIS WIFE

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.853
PAOLA, AND HIS EIGHT YEAR OLD

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.123
DAUGHTER PAOLA SHOWED ME IN HER

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:11.828
PHONE THE VIDEO THAT SHE KEEPS

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:14.898
OF THE SECURITY FOOTAGE OF HER

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:17.767
HUSBAND, LUIS, BEING CRUSHED BY

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:23.773
HEAVY MACHINERY. IN EACH CASE,

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.609
CAL OSHA WAS CALLED TO

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:28.478
INVESTIGATE, BUT TO THIS DAY

00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:32.415
THEY HAVE PAID A GRAND TOTAL OF

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:35.385
$18,000 IN FINES FOR LIVES. OF

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:38.488
THESE THREE MEN, THAT'S THREE

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:42.859
HUSBANDS, FATHERS, BREADWINNERS.

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:47.297
THAT $6,000 PER PER EMPLOYEE

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:52.669
KILLED. IS THAT WHAT A LIFE IS

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:54.437
WORTH IN CALIFORNIA? IS THAT

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:57.574
HOW WE TREAT VEHICULAR

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.509
MANSLAUGHTER? WHEN A DRUNK

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:02.312
DRIVER KILLS THREE PEOPLE? IF

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:04.547
WE DON'T ACT TODAY TO REFORM

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:07.684
CAL OSHA, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:10.253
SAYING TO YOUR HUSBAND, YOUR

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.522
DAD, YOUR BEST FRIEND, TO THE

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.390
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, THAT

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:16.459
THEY'RE ONLY WORTH $6,000 TO

00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:19.295
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WELL,

00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:22.198
I'M NOT WILLING TO COSIGN TO

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:25.368
THAT. NOT FOR LUIS, NOT FOR RAY,

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:27.270
AND DEFINITELY NOT FOR ALBERTO

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:29.539
AND THEIR FAMILIES, WHO DESERVE

00:58:29.606 --> 00:58:32.242
SO MUCH BETTER FROM ALL OF US.

00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:34.510
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:36.379
FROM OSHA TODAY AND THE

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:38.648
DEPARTMENT AND WHAT THEY'RE

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:41.885
DOING TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS.

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:43.486
THANK YOU, CHAIRWOMAN ORTEGA.

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:45.221
HEAR, HEAR. AND WELL SAID.

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:47.357
CHAIRWOMAN SMALLWOOD. CUEVAS.

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:49.058
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND I

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:51.961
WANT TO THANK MY GOOD COLLEAGUE,

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:54.430
SENATOR, SENATOR, ASSEMBLY

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:57.400
MEMBER ORTEGA, FOR HER WORK AND

00:58:57.467 --> 00:58:58.935
HER PASSION, BUT MORE

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:00.803
IMPORTANTLY, HER COMMITMENT TO

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:03.006
CHANGE. AND, YOU KNOW, JAMES

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:04.307
BALDWIN SAID, WE CAN'T CHANGE

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.509
WHAT WE DON'T FACE. AND I THINK

00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:09.245
TODAY IS ABOUT FACING THE HARD

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:12.181
FACTS ABOUT THE GAPS IN WHAT

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:16.052
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:19.289
AGENCY IS DOING TO ENSURE THAT

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:21.157
WORKERS ARE ABLE TO GO HOME TO

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.026
THEIR CHILDREN. AT THE END OF

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.794
THE DAY, THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.362
HEARING IS ABOUT. BEFORE COMING

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.498
TO THE LEGISLATURE, I REMEMBER

00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:30.099
PARTICIPATING IN WORKER

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:32.302
MEMORIALS WHERE WE WALKED

00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:33.536
CASKETS, CASKETS DOWN THE

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:35.738
STREET WITH THE FAMILIES OF

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:37.707
WORKERS WHO HAD LOST THEIR

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:40.510
LIVES ON THE JOB. THEY WERE NOT

00:59:40.576 --> 00:59:42.345
MADE WHOLE. THOSE FAMILIES. AND

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:45.548
TODAY IS REALLY AN HONOR OF SO

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:48.117
MANY OF THEM, SO THAT WE DON'T

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.419
HAVE THOSE KINDS OF CEREMONIES

00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:52.388
IN OUR CITIES BECAUSE WE AREN'T

00:59:52.455 --> 00:59:53.723
DOING ALL THAT WE CAN IN THIS

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.826
BODY, IN THIS CAPITAL, TO PASS

00:59:56.893 --> 01:00:00.663
LAWS AND ENFORCE LAWS THAT HOLD

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:01.464
EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:04.701
LIVES OF THEIR WORKERS AND THE

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.403
RIGHT TO WORK THE HUMAN RIGHT

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.539
TO WORK IN A SAFE AND HEALTHY

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:12.208
ENVIRONMENT. AS THE WORLD'S

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:13.910
LARGEST, ONE OF THE WORLD'S

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:14.577
LARGEST ECONOMY, THE FOURTH

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:16.746
LARGEST, CALIFORNIA LEADS THE

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:18.581
NATION IN POLICIES THAT PROTECT

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:20.283
WORKERS. AND I'M PROUD OF THE

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.418
WORK THAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:24.087
THE LEGISLATURE. BUT I HAVE TO

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.255
TELL YOU, THE RESULTS OF THIS

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:28.524
AUDIT WERE STUNNING, AND WE

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:31.394
DON'T HAVE A LOT TO BE PROUD OF

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.429
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:36.332
IN THE PAST, IN TERMS OF THE

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:37.500
INVESTMENTS, IN TERMS OF THE

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.135
INNOVATION, IN TERMS OF THE

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.670
CRITICAL THINKING STRATEGIES,

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.405
PLANNING AND GOALS AROUND

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.675
ENSURING THAT OCCUPATIONAL

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:47.176
SAFETY AND HEALTH IS

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.345
PRIORITIZED. BUT THAT'S THE

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:52.281
PAST, AND TODAY IS ABOUT MOVING

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:55.952
FORWARD AND LEARNING FROM WHAT

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:58.388
THE AUDIT HAS SHOWN US TO BUILD

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:02.625
NEW STRATEGIES, NEW PROTOCOLS,

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.527
NEW WAYS OF ENGAGING WITH

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:07.964
EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS TO ENSURE,

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:11.834
AGAIN, THAT WE HAVE LIFE

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:15.638
CHANGING PROCEDURES AND WELL

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.473
TRAINED STAFF THAT ARE ABLE TO

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.308
IMPLEMENT THE LAWS THAT WE PASS

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.310
HERE EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.146
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, EVEN

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:25.982
THOSE WHO ARE FINDING GOOD JOBS

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:28.151
OFTEN FACE EXPLOITATION AND

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:31.020
ABUSE AND UNSAFE WORKING

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:33.623
CONDITIONS. AND IT IS THE

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:34.424
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE DUTY OF

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.660
CAL OSHA, OF OUR PUBLIC

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:39.762
AGENCIES TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.931
AND TO ENSURE WORKPLACE SAFETY

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:45.101
LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE DULY

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:48.337
FOLLOWED. AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:49.972
THAT WE'RE PRIORITIZING

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:53.076
ENFORCEMENT. AND I WANT TO SAY,

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:55.278
THE GLORY YEARS OF A $97

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:58.481
BILLION SURPLUS ARE OVER. WE

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:02.351
ARE NOW IN A SERIES OF ONGOING

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:05.288
DEFICITS WHERE DOLLARS TO

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.422
INVEST IN ENFORCEMENT WILL BE

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.224
HARD TO COME BY, AND WE NEED

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.793
OUR AGENCIES TO DO THE JOB AND

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.428
TO HAVE THE MECHANISMS IN PLACE

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:14.897
TO HOLD EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE,

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:16.666
LEVY FINES AND PENALTIES, AND

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.701
BE ABLE TO COLLECT ON THOSE TO

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:21.404
GO BACK INTO OUR ENFORCEMENT

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:24.340
INFRASTRUCTURE. IF WE ARE NOT

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.175
ABLE. AND WHAT THIS AUDIT HAS

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.478
SHOWN, IF WE ARE NOT CAPABLE OF

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.213
WRITING UP GOOD CASES, IF WE

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.381
ARE NOT ABLE TO DOCUMENT, IF WE

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:35.751
ARE NOT ABLE TO LEVY FINES AND

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.220
PENALTIES AGAINST COMPANIES

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:40.490
THAT ARE COSTING THE LIVES OF

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.391
CALIFORNIANS TO BE LOST, AND

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.494
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HOLD THEM

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.497
ACCOUNTABLE AND TO USE DOLLARS

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:50.233
BASED ON WHAT THEIR WRONGDOING

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.068
HAS CREATED TO COME BACK INTO

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.670
OUR BUDGET TO ENSURE THAT NO

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.839
OTHER EMPLOYER DOES THE SAME

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:58.207
THING, THEN WE NEED TO REALLY

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.475
QUESTION WHAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:02.278
HERE. AND I THINK THIS IS ABOUT

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.514
AS MUCH AS IT IS ABOUT HEALTH

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.115
AND SAFETY. IT'S ABOUT ALSO

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.451
ENSURING THAT THERE IS A LEVEL

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.419
PLAYING FIELD WHERE EMPLOYERS

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:11.187
ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE SO THAT

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.289
WORKERS ARE SAFE IN THE STATE

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:14.423
OF CALIFORNIA, HAS THE

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.292
RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO ENFORCE

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:19.495
OUR LAWS AND EVERY WORKSITE

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.497
POSSIBLE IN THIS STATE TO

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.432
PROTECT WORKERS. THIS IS A

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:25.101
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT, GIVEN

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.936
THE ATTACKS THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.704
ON IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES RIGHT

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:31.307
NOW IN SOME OF OUR WORK SITES,

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.675
WHERE IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE BY

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:35.578
THIS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THIS

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.445
IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT, AS

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:40.249
WE'RE LOOKING AT SEVERE HEAT

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.119
CONDITIONS ON WORK SITES. WE

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.820
MUST ENSURE THAT ALL WORKERS

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:47.490
KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE SAFE AT

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:50.359
WORK, REGARDLESS OF THEIR

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:53.229
IMMIGRATION STATUS, BECAUSE WE

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.364
HAVE THE LAWS TO PROTECT THEM,

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.533
WE MUST KNOW THAT WORKERS WILL

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.802
BE SAFE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:00.369
ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.371
ARE IMPACTING THEIR HEALTH AND

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:04.173
WELL-BEING ON THE WORK SITE, WE

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.242
HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY THEY

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:08.344
ARE PROTECTED. I DO WANT TO

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:09.145
THANK THE STATE AUDITOR FOR

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:10.780
THIS REPORT, THIS THOROUGH

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:13.482
REPORT. IT REINFORCES A LOT OF

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:16.652
WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW, AND OUR

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:17.420
STATE HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY.

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:19.622
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE KNOW OUR

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.358
RESOURCES FOR ENFORCING HAVE

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.794
NOT HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.629
THIS GROWTH TODAY IS ABOUT

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:27.630
BUILDING A FOUNDATION, THE

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.699
FOUNDATION WE NEED TO ENSURE

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.601
SAFETY FOR WORKERS TO MAKE SURE

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.569
THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:34.437
INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS, AND THAT

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.072
WE'RE HOLDING THIS AGENCY

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:37.406
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE GOALS THAT

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.475
WILL BE SET AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.911
AUDIT, SO THAT WE WILL NOT BE

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.880
HERE DOWN THE LINE TWO YEARS,

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.315

BEGINNING. I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:52.488

THIS MORNING. LAST JULY, MY

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:55.484
OFFICE ISSUED AN AUDIT REPORT

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:57.620
FOCUSING ON CAL OSHA AND ITS

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.655
PROCESSES FOR PROTECTING

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:01.090
WORKERS FROM UNSAFE LABOR

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:03.559
CONDITIONS. IN RESPONSE TO A

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.293
REQUEST FROM CHAIR ORTEGA.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.595
AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHAIR

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:07.229
ORTEGA'S REQUEST CITED

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.298
POTENTIAL CONCERNS OVER CAL

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:10.866
OSHA'S PRACTICES FOR

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.568
INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS OF

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:13.369
UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS, SUCH

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.638
AS BY NOT CONDUCTING TIMELY

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.206
INVESTIGATIONS OR DECLINING TO

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:19.108
INVESTIGATE. THE AUDIT REQUEST

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:21.210
ALSO SOUGHT INFORMATION OVER

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:23.346
HOW CAL OSHA HOLDS EMPLOYERS

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.147
ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH ENFORCEMENT

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:26.449
ACTIONS, SUCH AS BY IMPOSING

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.484
FINES AND COLLECTING FEES. AND

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.252
ULTIMATELY, CHAIR ORTEGA ASKED

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:33.022
MY OFFICE TO EVALUATE ANY

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.857
STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES IN CAL

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.492
OSHA'S PROCESSES FOR PROTECTING

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.127
WORKERS AND TO IDENTIFY THE

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:40.262
UNDERLYING ROOT CAUSES BEHIND

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:42.164
THOSE DEFICIENCIES. BY WAY OF

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:44.266
BACKGROUND, OUR AUDIT WORK

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.768
PRIMARILY COVERED A FIVE YEAR

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.269
AUDIT PERIOD FROM FISCAL YEAR

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:51.073
20 1920 THROUGH 20 2324, WHERE

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.642
MY STAFF REVIEWED DATA ON

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:55.745
COMPLAINT VOLUME, THE NUMBER OF

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:56.345
INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED, AND

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.447
THE RESULTING FINES IMPOSED IN

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.349
THE AMOUNTS COLLECTED FROM

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:02.184
EMPLOYERS. MY STAFF ALSO

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.053
REVIEWED A SELECTION OF 60 CASE

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.187
FILES, CONSISTING OF BOTH

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.256
COMPLAINTS AND WORKER ACCIDENTS,

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.557
FOR THE PURPOSE OF EVALUATING

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:11.560
CAL OSHA'S DECISION MAKING WHEN

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:13.429
PROCESSING THOSE CASES. OUR

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:14.263
AUDIT ALSO REVIEWED HOW CAL

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:16.232
OSHA DETERMINED THE FINE

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:17.466
AMOUNTS FOR 20 DIFFERENT

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.135
VIOLATIONS ACROSS TEN CASES,

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.670
INCLUDING THREE WORKER FATALITY

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:23.139
CASES. COMPARING CAL OSHA'S

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:25.241
CALCULATION OF THE FINES TO OUR

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:26.509
OWN CALCULATIONS BASED ON STATE

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:28.677
LAW AND CAL OSHA'S POLICIES.

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.379
AND FINALLY, WE DETERMINED HOW

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:32.114
INITIAL FINE AMOUNTS WERE LATER

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:34.884
REDUCED THROUGH POST CITATION

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.019
SETTLEMENT PROCESSES, AND WE

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:38.254
ATTEMPTED TO ASCERTAIN THE

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.423
RATIONALE BEHIND CAL OSHA'S

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:41.257
DECISION MAKING WHEN DECIDING

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.359
THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY FINE

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:45.628
REDUCTIONS. SO OVERALL, IN

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:48.297
TERMS OF OUR AUDIT FINDINGS AND

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:49.365
OBSERVATIONS, OUR AUDIT NOTED A

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:50.199
NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ROOT

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:52.435
CAUSES THAT LED TO THE FINDINGS

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:54.270
THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:55.604
LATER IN MY PRESENTATION. BUT

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:57.406
THESE ROOT CAUSES, IN OUR VIEW,

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.575
LIMITS CAL OSHA'S ABILITY TO

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.510
PROTECT WORKERS. THE FIRST ONE,

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:03.078
WHICH WE'VE ALREADY TOUCHED ON

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:04.413
A LITTLE ALREADY THIS MORNING,

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.282
IS THAT AT THE TIME OF OUR

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:08.184
AUDIT PERIOD, CAL OSHA WAS

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.385
FACING SIGNIFICANT STAFFING

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:12.154
SHORTAGES. IN 2324, THE LAST

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:13.489
YEAR OF OUR FIVE YEAR AUDIT

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:15.391
PERIOD, CAL OSHA HAD A 32%

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.259
VACANCY RATE WITH SOME OF ITS

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:19.395
DISTRICT OFFICES, SUCH AS IN

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:21.497
BAKERSFIELD, SANTA ANA AND SAN

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:22.431
BERNARDINO HAVING VACANCY RATES

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:25.568
OF 50% OR HIGHER. THIS CAN LEAD,

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.536
OBVIOUSLY, TO AN OVERSTRAINED

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:28.804
CAL OSHA WORKFORCE THAT IS

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.306
LIMITED IN HOW MANY INSPECTIONS

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.174
OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:34.410
THEY CAN ENGAGE IN TO PROTECT

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:36.145
WORKERS. SOME OF THE

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:37.847
EXPLANATIONS WE HEARD FROM CAL

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:40.149
OSHA FOR THE LIMITED STAFFING,

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.351
TOO FEW QUALIFIED CANDIDATES

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:45.221
LIMITING THE APPLICANT POOL,

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.389
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE HIRING

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.158
SYSTEMS THAT WEREN'T INTEGRATED

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.427
IN A CENTRALIZED PROCESS, PAY

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:52.628
DISPARITIES AMONG DIFFERENT

01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:54.597
WORKER CLASSIFICATIONS THAT LED

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.332
TO HIGH VACANCY RATES IN

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:58.534
CERTAIN POSITIONS, AND ALSO

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:00.336
ETERNAL ATTRITION WITHIN CAL

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.171
OSHA, WHERE WORKERS ARE LEAVING

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.572
TO SEEK MORE MANAGEABLE

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.508
WORKLOADS ELSEWHERE. THE SECOND

01:09:05.574 --> 01:09:07.143
ROOT CAUSE THAT WE IDENTIFIED

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.378
DURING THE AUDIT IS THAT CAL

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:10.613
OSHA'S CASE FILES ARE HARD COPY

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:13.249
BASED, AND THERE IS NO

01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:14.583
ELECTRONIC CASE MANAGEMENT

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:15.317
SYSTEM TO HELP IT MANAGE ITS

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:18.320
WORKLOAD. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE

01:09:18.387 --> 01:09:19.388
ACCIDENT THAT WE SELECTED FOR

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:20.289
REVIEW WAS ULTIMATELY

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.224
UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE CAL OSHA

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.859
ACCIDENTALLY DESTROYED IT IN A

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.294
MISTAKE WHEN STORING SEVERAL

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:27.463
BOXES OF HARD COPY CASE FILES.

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:29.565
AND FOR THE HARD COPY DOCUMENTS,

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:31.600
WE COULD REVIEW MISSING

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.468
INFORMATION OR ILLEGIBLE CASE

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:35.237
NOTES CREATED AMBIGUITY FOR WHY

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:36.372
CERTAIN CASES WERE NOT

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:38.340
INSPECTED, OR WHY INITIAL FINE

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:40.276
AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY CAL OSHA

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.211
WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED. AND

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:44.346
THIRD, MANY OF THE THIRD ROOT

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:45.514
CAUSE. MANY OF CAL OSHA'S

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:47.149
POLICY AND GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.418
ARE OUTDATED OR ARE UNCLEAR,

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:51.020
AND HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED OR

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.121
REVISED FOR SEVERAL YEARS,

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:54.790
LEADING TO INCONSISTENCY AMONG

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:55.724
STAFF AND MANAGERS AT DIFFERENT

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.259
DISTRICT OFFICES AND HOW THEY

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.695
JUSTIFY AND THEN DOCUMENT KEY

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.497
DECISION MAKING. FOR EXAMPLE,

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:03.299
CAL OSHA'S POLICIES ON EMPLOYER

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.934
CITATIONS AND VERIFYING

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.303
ABATEMENT WAS LAST UPDATED 17

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.938
YEARS AGO, AND ITS ACCIDENT

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:10.172
INVESTIGATION POLICY IS

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.007
CURRENTLY MARKED DRAFT AND

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.009
INCLUDES PROVISIONS OF LAW THAT

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.678
BECAME OBSOLETE IN 2020. THESE

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:17.379
UNDERLYING ROOT CAUSES HAVE

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:18.347
RESULTED IN AUDIT FINDINGS IN

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:21.450
THREE GENERAL AREAS. FIRST, CAL

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:22.751
OSHA'S INCONSISTENCY WHEN

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:23.786
DECIDING WHETHER AND HOW TO

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.454
RESPOND TO WORKER ACCIDENTS AND

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.990
COMPLAINTS. NUMBER TWO, CAL

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.458
OSHA INCONSISTENCY IN THE

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:30.593
TIMELINESS AND THE QUALITY OF

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:32.494
THE WORK IT PERFORMS. AND THIRD,

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.630
WE BELIEVE CAL OSHA IS MISSING

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:35.364
OPPORTUNITIES TO PROTECT

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:37.032
WORKERS BY NOT ALWAYS REQUIRING

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.467
EVIDENCE OF CORRECTIVE ACTION

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:41.070
FROM EMPLOYERS OR BY LIMITING

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:41.704
EMPLOYER ACCOUNTABILITY BY

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.906
REDUCING FINE AMOUNTS WITH

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.474
LIMITED EXPLANATION. SO NOW

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.109
I'LL GO INTO THOSE THREE

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.277
GENERAL FINDING AREAS IN A

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.346
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL WITH

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:52.214
RESPECT TO DECIDING WHETHER AND

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.382
HOW TO RESPOND TO WORKER

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.617
COMPLAINTS AND ACCIDENTS. AND

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.218
I'LL START WITH COMPLAINTS. IN

01:10:56.285 --> 01:11:00.189
FISCAL YEAR 2324, CAL OSHA

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:01.857
RECEIVED ROUGHLY 10,500

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.760
COMPLAINTS ALLEGING WORKPLACE

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:06.161
HEALTH OR SAFETY CONCERNS, AND

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:07.563
CAL OSHA TYPICALLY HANDLES

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.132
THESE COMPLAINTS IN ONE OF TWO

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.701
WAYS. ONE WAY IS CAL OSHA STAFF

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:13.769
CONDUCT AN ON SITE INSPECTION

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:16.271
OF THE EMPLOYER. THE SECOND

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:17.606
APPROACH IS CAL OSHA DIRECTS

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:18.607
THE EMPLOYER TO SELF

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:20.442
INVESTIGATE ITSELF AND REPORT

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.277
BACK TO CAL OSHA. AND THAT'S

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.747
CALLED A LETTER INVESTIGATION.

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:25.648
AND THESE LETTER INVESTIGATIONS

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:28.217
ARE ACTUALLY VERY COMMON. IN

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:29.451
2324, CAL OSHA CONDUCTED THEIR

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:31.754
OWN ON SITE INSPECTIONS JUST

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.322
20% OF THE TIME, WHILE LETTER

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.957
INVESTIGATIONS WERE CONDUCTED

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:36.091
BY EMPLOYERS WERE USED MORE

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.293
THAN 80% OF THE TIME. AND

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.461
NOTABLY, THESE LETTER

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.196
INVESTIGATIONS DO NOT RESULT IN

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:42.398
FINES. OUR AUDIT ALSO

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:44.333
QUESTIONED CAL OSHA'S DECISION

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.001
MAKING WHEN NOT CONDUCTING ITS

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:47.336
OWN INSPECTIONS FOR NINE OF THE

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.738
30 CASES WE REVIEWED, BECAUSE

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:50.639
CAL OSHA OFTEN LACKED EVIDENCE

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:51.340
TO DEMONSTRATE THEY WERE

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:53.409
FOLLOWING CAL OSHA'S POLICIES.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.277
IN ONE CASE WHERE WE DISAGREED

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:57.646
WITH CAL OSHA, A WORKER

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:58.380
COMPLAINED THAT ITS EMPLOYER

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:00.215
HAD FAILED TO FIX AN AIR

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:01.317
CONDITIONING UNIT IN THE

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:02.584
KITCHEN, WHERE THE TEMPERATURE

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.253
OFTEN EXCEEDED 90 DEGREES, AND

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:05.454
THE WORKER WAS TAKEN BY AN

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.790
AMBULANCE TO THE ER FOR HELP

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:10.225
FOR HEAT ILLNESS. CAL OSHA

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.493
POLICIES REQUIRED AN ON SITE

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.862
INSPECTION, BUT ONE WAS NOT

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:15.431
PERFORMED, AND NOTABLY CAL OSHA

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.066
RECEIVED A SIMILAR COMPLAINT

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:18.834
ABOUT THE SAME EMPLOYER'S AIR

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:20.469
CONDITIONING UNIT A FEW MONTHS

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:22.638
EARLIER, AND AT THE TIME, CAL

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.306
OSHA REQUIRED THE EMPLOYER TO

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:25.574
SELF INVESTIGATE THAT CASE. BUT

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:28.243
CAL OSHA HAD YET TO HEAR BACK

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.545
FROM THE EMPLOYER. SO CAL OSHA

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:32.247
SENT A SECOND LETTER CITING

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:33.982
MANAGER DISCRETION FOR THE

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:35.284
JUSTIFICATION OF NOT DOING ITS

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.553
OWN ON SITE INSPECTION. AND

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.088
WHEN RESPONDING TO THE SECOND

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:40.656
LETTER, THE EMPLOYER DID NOT

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:41.490
PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.392
THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:44.259
ACTUALLY FIXED, SUCH AS WITH

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:46.228
REPAIR INVOICES OR PHOTOGRAPHIC

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.664
EVIDENCE OR OTHER INDICATIONS

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:51.300
OF CORRECTIVE ACTION. EMPLOYERS

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:52.534
NOT PROVIDING CLEAR EVIDENCE

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.169
THAT THEY FIXED UNSAFE WORKING

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:55.404
CONDITIONS WAS A COMMON

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:56.605
OBSERVATION. WE NOTED DURING

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.273
THE AUDIT FOR THESE LETTER

01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.375
INVESTIGATIONS WHERE EMPLOYERS

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:00.509
ARE INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES.

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:03.312
WE NOTED THIS IN 15 OF THE 24

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:05.781
INSTANCES WHERE EMPLOYERS SELF

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:06.749
INVESTIGATED THEIR OWN

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:08.484
VIOLATIONS, AND IN THREE OF

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.252
THOSE 24 INSTANCES, CAL OSHA

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:12.154
CLOSED THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.455
EVER DOCUMENTING A RESPONSE

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.224
FROM THE EMPLOYER. AS FOR

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:17.259
ACCIDENTS, STATE LAW GENERALLY

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.861
REQUIRES CAL OSHA TO REVIEW THE

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.462
CAUSE OF ANY EMPLOYMENT

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:21.663
ACCIDENT THAT RESULTS IN

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.398
SERIOUS INJURY. DURING THE

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:25.134
AUDIT, WE NOTED INSTANCES WHERE

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.335
CAL OSHA DECIDED AGAINST

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:27.569
CONDUCTING ON SITE INSPECTIONS

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:30.572
OF EMPLOYERS DESPITE WORK

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:31.373
INJURY DESCRIPTIONS IN THE CASE

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.776
FILES THAT APPEARED CONCERNING

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:35.410
TO US. WHEN WE ASKED CAL OSHA

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:37.646
WHY THEY DID NOT INSPECT THESE

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:39.181
CASES, THEY OFTEN PROVIDED

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.449
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AND

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:41.950
INFORMATION THAT WAS NOT

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.586
PRESENT IN THE FILES THAT WE

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:45.420
COULD CORROBORATE. IN ONE

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.456
EXAMPLE, AN EMPLOYEE SUFFERED A

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:48.423
LACERATION OF THE SHIN FROM A

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.425
CHAINSAW, RESULTING IN SURGERY

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:52.194
AND AN OVERNIGHT STAY IN THE

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.428
HOSPITAL AND SIX WEEKS OF

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:55.531
RECOVERY. YET THE CASE FILE DID

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.266
NOT EXPLAIN WHY CAL OSHA

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.434
CONDUCTED WELL. THE CASE FILE

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:01.303
DID NOT EXPLAIN WHY CAL OSHA

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.371
CONCLUDED THIS WAS NOT A

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:04.540
SERIOUS INJURY WORTH INSPECTING,

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:06.175
AND THE MANAGER VERBALLY

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:07.342
EXPLAINED THAT IT APPEARED THAT

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:08.644
THE WORKER WAS WEARING SAFETY

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.145
EQUIPMENT, BUT THERE WAS

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.346
NOTHING IN THE CASE FILE TO

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:12.514
SUBSTANTIATE THAT OR EXPLAIN

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:15.184
WHY THE EMPLOYER POTENTIALLY

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.586
WAS NOT AT FAULT. AND ANOTHER

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:19.221
EXAMPLE A WORKER WAS STRUCK IN

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.455
THE HEAD, RESULTING IN A SKULL

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:22.257
FRACTURE THAT RENDERED THE

01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:23.892
WORKER UNCONSCIOUS FOR 5 TO 10

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:26.528
MINUTES. BUT CAL OSHA EXPLAINED

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.163
TO US THAT THE WORKER LIKELY

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:29.865
HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY ADMITTED

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:31.633
TO THE HOSPITAL FOR INPATIENT

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.368
CARE, THUS MAKING THE INJURY

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:35.470
LESS THAN SERIOUS. BUT THE CASE

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:37.973
FILE NOTED THAT THE WORKER WAS

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:38.841
ACTUALLY IN THE HOSPITAL FOR

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:41.743
NINE HOURS. GETTING TREATMENT

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.312
UNDER STAFFING WAS OFTEN THE

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:45.781
CAUSE CITED BY CAL OSHA STAFF

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:46.748
FOR THE LACK OF INSPECTIONS.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.483
EVERY DISTRICT MANAGER WE SPOKE

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:50.152
TO DURING THE AUDIT INDICATED

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:51.386
THAT THEY WERE SHORT STAFFED

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.388
AND THEY'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:54.723
DO MORE, BUT THEY LACKED THE

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.325
RESOURCES TO DO SO. BEYOND

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:57.593
QUESTIONING WHY INSPECTIONS

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.261
WEREN'T TAKING PLACE, WE ALSO

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:00.295
NOTED WEAKNESSES WITH THE

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:01.563
TIMELINESS AND THE QUALITY OF

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.432
THE INSPECTIONS THAT CAL OSHA

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:05.234
WAS PERFORMING. WITH RESPECT TO

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.802
TIMELINESS OVER A FIVE YEAR

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:08.136
AUDIT PERIOD, WE NOTED LATE ON

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:10.239
SITE INSPECTIONS FOR IMMINENT

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.874
HAZARD COMPLAINTS OR THE MOST

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.275
DANGEROUS CASES STARTING LATE

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:16.111
BETWEEN 6 TO 10% OF THE TIME,

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:18.413
OR 50 TO 170 CASES PER YEAR FOR

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.649
SERIOUS INJURY COMPLAINTS. THEY

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:22.150
STARTED LATE AROUND 23% OF THE

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:24.786
TIME, ROUGHLY 400 TO 500 CASES

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.021
PER YEAR, AND THE REMAINING

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.689
COMPLAINTS WERE STARTED LATE

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.358
AROUND 40% OF THE TIME, OR

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.360
ROUGHLY 1000 CASES PER YEAR.

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:33.295
AND THESE STATISTICS FROM CAL

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.897
OSHA MIRRORED THE RESULTS OF

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:36.965
OUR OWN CASE REVIEWS. IN TERMS

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:38.367
OF TIMELY INVESTIGATIONS, WE

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:39.902
ALSO NOTED ISSUE WITH THE

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:40.769
QUALITY OF THE INSPECTIONS

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:43.405
THEMSELVES. CAL OSHA DOES NOT

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:45.173
CONSISTENTLY EVALUATE EMPLOYERS

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.441
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ILLNESS,

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:48.110
INJURY AND PREVENTION PROGRAM

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:49.444
PLANS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:52.381
REQUIRED TO DEVELOP UNDER LAW.

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:53.148
INSPECTING THESE PLANS ARE

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.284
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GIVES CAL

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:58.453
OSHA A SENSE OF THE EMPLOYER'S

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.321
WORKPLACE CULTURE AND THE

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.089
SAFETY PRACTICES THAT THEY'VE

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:02.124
ESTABLISHED TO PROTECT WORKERS,

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:05.294
BUT FOR BUT FOR SEVEN OF THE 15

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.428
COMPLAINT INSPECTIONS WE

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.329
REVIEWED, THEY LACKED A

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.665
COMPLETE EVALUATION OF THE

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:11.566
EMPLOYER'S IIPP PLAN. AND WE

01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:14.069
NOTED THAT CAL OSHA HAS NOT

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:14.670
ESTABLISHED EXPECTATIONS FOR

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.972
HOW ITS STAFF ARE TO DOCUMENT

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:18.340
THEIR EVALUATIONS AND

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.042
CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:22.244
EMPLOYER COMPLIANCE. THE

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:23.612
QUALITY OF CAL OSHA INSPECTIONS

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.447
IS ALSO HAMPERED BY

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:26.248
INCONSISTENT DOCUMENTATION

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.483
PRACTICES. WE SAW HARD COPY

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:30.519
CASE FILES MISSING RELEVANT

01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:31.753
WORKSHEETS THAT ARE USED TO

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.388
ENSURE ADEQUATE EVIDENCE IS

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:36.258
COLLECTED AND DOCUMENTED. NOT

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.460
USING THIS TOOL AT TIMES LED TO

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:39.728
GAPS IN THE EVIDENCE THAT CAL

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:41.330
OSHA COLLECTED THAT HAD

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:42.664
NEGATIVE OUTCOMES IN HOLDING

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:44.366
EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE. AND ONE

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.501
OF THE FATAL ACCIDENTS THAT WE

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.203
REVIEWED, THE CASE FILE DID NOT

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.237
INCLUDE ANY VIOLATION

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:50.739
WORKSHEETS TO ENSURE ALL

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:51.506
NECESSARY EVIDENCE WAS

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:53.308
COLLECTED AND ORGANIZED. AND

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.377
WHEN THE EMPLOYER APPEALED THE

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.579
SERIOUS VIOLATION IMPOSED, CAL

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.247
OSHA REDUCED IT TO A VIOLATION

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:02.217
WITH A FINE OF $600. CAL,

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:04.753
OSHA'S OWN INTERNAL AUDITOR

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.388
NOTED IN 2023 THAT INSPECTION

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:07.856
CASE FILES WERE NOT ALWAYS

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.024
COMPLETE. MISSING INTERVIEW

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:11.193
NOTES AND VIOLATION WORKSHEETS,

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.427
CONCLUDING THAT OUTDATED

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.629
POLICIES AND MULTIPLE VERSIONS

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.198
OF THE SAME FORM WERE PART OF

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:18.633
THE PROBLEM. OUR AUDIT ALSO

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:21.336
TOOK ISSUE WITH HOW CAL OSHA IS

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:22.671
ENSURING THAT CORRECTIVE ACTION

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:25.240
IS BEING TAKEN BY EMPLOYERS,

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.442
AND THAT FINE REDUCTIONS ARE

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:28.510
EXPLAINED ADEQUATELY AND

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:31.446
JUSTIFIED IN TERMS OF

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.648
DEMONSTRATING CORRECTIVE ACTION.

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.684
EARLIER, I MENTIONED WHEN

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:36.418
EMPLOYERS SELF INVESTIGATE

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.353
THEMSELVES, THEY OFTEN DIDN'T

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.921
PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THEY TOOK

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.189
CORRECTIVE ACTION. BUT WE SAW A

01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:43.191
SIMILAR PATTERN WITH CAL OSHA'S

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:45.394
OWN INVESTIGATIONS, WHERE CAL

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:46.361
OSHA STAFF DID NOT CONSISTENTLY

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:48.263
OBTAIN EVIDENCE THAT EMPLOYERS

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.564
CORRECTED ISSUES FOUND DURING

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:52.567
ON SITE INSPECTIONS. STATE LAW

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:53.902
AND CAL OSHA POLICY REQUIRES

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.237
EMPLOYERS TO CERTIFY THAT THEY

01:17:55.303 --> 01:17:57.272
HAVE FIXED, UNSAFE WORKING

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:58.607
CONDITIONS. BUT NEITHER THE LAW

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:00.242
NOR CAL OSHA POLICIES ARE

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.344
EXPLICIT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:03.445
DOCUMENTING AND VERIFYING THAT

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:04.246
CORRECTIVE ACTION HAS BEEN

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:06.681
SUCCESSFULLY TAKEN. WE HAD

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:08.517
EXPECTED TO SEE EVIDENCE, SUCH

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:09.384
AS PHOTOGRAPHS AND REPAIR

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:10.552
INVOICES, DEMONSTRATING THAT

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.154
THE WORKING CONDITIONS HAD BEEN

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.289
IMPROVED FOLLOWING A CAL OSHA

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.425
INSPECTION. BUT FIVE OF THE 11

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:17.859
CASES THAT RESULTED IN

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:18.427
CITATIONS THAT WE REVIEWED

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.362
LACKED SUPPORTING EVIDENCE AND

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:22.064
IN SOME CASES EVEN LACKED THE

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.865
EMPLOYER CERTIFICATION OF

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:26.401
CORRECTION. SIMILARLY, IN 2023,

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:29.404
FEDERAL OSHA FOUND THAT 27% OF

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:31.473
CAL OSHA'S FILES LACKED

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.274
SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION TO

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.543
DEMONSTRATE ABATEMENT, AND IN

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:36.344
39% OF THOSE CASES WERE

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:38.313
EMPLOYERS CERTIFIED THAT THEY

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.181
HAD FIXED THE PROBLEM. THERE

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:41.183
WAS NOT DOCUMENTATION THAT CAL

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:42.818
OSHA INSPECTORS HAD OBSERVED OR

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:46.354
VERIFIED ABATEMENT. OUR AUDIT

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:48.490
ALSO IDENTIFIED INSTANCES WHERE

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:49.357
CAL OSHA STAFF MADE

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.593
QUESTIONABLE DECISIONS WHEN

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.360
CALCULATING FINE AMOUNTS,

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:54.196
POTENTIALLY LEADING TO LOWER

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:55.497
FINES IMPOSED ON EMPLOYERS THAN

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.632
WOULD OTHERWISE RESULT UNDER

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:59.167
APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. IN OUR

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:01.002
AUDIT REPORT, WE WALKED THROUGH

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:02.471
AN EXAMPLE WHERE A WORKER WAS

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:04.172
KILLED DURING A FORKLIFT

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.408
ACCIDENT, WHERE A SUPERVISOR

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:07.309
FROM THAT COMPANY WAS DRIVING

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:10.445
THE FORKLIFT UNSAFELY, AND WE

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:11.913
COMPARED HOW CAL OSHA

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:13.849
CALCULATED THE EMPLOYER'S FINE

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:16.551
VERSUS OUR OWN CALCULATION. CAL

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:18.920
OSHA CLASSIFIED THE ACCIDENT AS

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:20.255
JUST A GENERAL VIOLATION WITH

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:22.390
THE $2,000 BASE FINE, BUT BASED

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:24.392
ON THE FACTS PRESENTED, WE

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:25.227
CLASSIFIED IT AS A SERIOUS

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:27.496
ACCIDENT GIVEN THE FATALITY,

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.331
AND WE APPLIED A HIGHER BASE

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:31.299
FINE OF $18,000, CAL OSHA

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:32.501
DETERMINED THAT THE EMPLOYER

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:34.236
HAD A GOOD COMPLIANCE HISTORY

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:35.437
WITHOUT EVIDENCE TO EXPLAIN WHY

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.606
IN THE CASE FILES RESULTING IN

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:39.908
CAL OSHA APPLYING A PARTIAL

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:41.376
FINE REDUCTION. BUT WE FOUND

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:42.978
THE EMPLOYER HAD TWO PREVIOUS

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:44.346
VIOLATIONS AND WASN'T ENTITLED

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:46.748
TO A FINE REDUCTION, ESPECIALLY

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:48.416
DUE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:50.585
ACCIDENT. CAL OSHA GRANTED THE

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:52.154
EMPLOYER AN ABATEMENT CREDIT

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.388
THAT REDUCED THE ALREADY LOW

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:56.591
FINE BY 50%, WHICH IS STANDARD

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:57.692
FOR GENERAL VIOLATIONS. BUT OUR

01:19:57.759 --> 01:19:59.427
CALCULATION RECOGNIZED THAT

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.897
FATAL AND SERIOUS ACCIDENTS

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:03.298
AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR ABATEMENT

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:05.100
CREDITS UNDER CAL OSHA POLICY.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.202
AND AFTER APPLYING ALL OTHER

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.470
ADJUSTMENT FACTORS, CAL OSHA

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:10.572
ULTIMATELY IMPOSED A FINE OF

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.874
$21,000, ROUGHLY FOR THE ENTIRE

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:15.010
CASE, WHILE ALL WHILE OUR

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:16.378
CALCULATION WAS NEARLY DOUBLE

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:19.247
THAT AMOUNT AT $40,000. WHEN WE

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:21.316
SHOWED THIS EXAMPLE TO CAL

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.051
OSHA'S DISTRICT MANAGER, HE

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:23.585
COULD NOT PROVIDE A CLEAR

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.554
EXPLANATION FOR THE DISPARITY

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.588
AND COULD ONLY SPECULATE WHAT

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.557
CAL OSHA STAFF MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:29.257
THINKING WHEN CALCULATING THE

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.626
FINE AMOUNT. A CONTRIBUTING

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.528
FACTOR TO THE INCONSISTENCY IS

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:34.729
CAL OSHA'S POLICIES THAT DO NOT

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:37.132
SPECIFY HOW OR WHERE PERSONNEL

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.267
SHOULD DOCUMENT THEIR REASONING.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.102
WHEN CALCULATING FINE AMOUNTS.

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:43.271
I CAN TELL YOU GOING THROUGH

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:44.472
THE CASE FILES, IT WAS

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:45.207
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR THE

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:47.242
AUDIT TEAM TO GET AT THE

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:48.443
RATIONALE BEHIND THE DECISION

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.078
MAKING DECISIONS WERE

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.680
DOCUMENTED, BUT THE WHY WAS

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:54.716
DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW. IN 14 OF

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:56.218
THE 20 VIOLATIONS WE REVIEWED,

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.519
CAL OSHA DID NOT DOCUMENT OR

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:59.588
EXPLAIN AT LEAST ONE FINE

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.256
ADJUSTMENT FACTOR, WHICH CAUSED

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.058
OSHA FINE TO BE LOWER THAN MAY

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:04.726
HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN WARRANTED.

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.494
AND WE ALSO NOTED DURING THE

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.496
AUDIT THAT ONCE THAT FINE IS

01:21:08.563 --> 01:21:10.265
INITIALLY IMPOSED, IT CAN BE

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:11.733
FURTHER REDUCED AS PART OF A

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.268
SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATION PROCESS

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:16.371
BETWEEN CAL OSHA AND EMPLOYERS.

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.473
OVER OUR FIVE YEAR AUDIT PERIOD,

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.342
ROUGHLY 23,000 INSPECTIONS

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.110
INCLUDED FINES, AND 36% OF

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:24.279
THOSE HAD REDUCTIONS. AS PART

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:25.513
OF A SETTLEMENT WITH CAL OSHA,

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.182
AND THE SIZE OF THESE

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:28.450
REDUCTIONS VARIED IN SIZE, BUT

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:31.152
ROUGHLY ON AVERAGE IT WAS 56%

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:33.288
REDUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL FINE

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:34.689
AMOUNT. AND WE REVIEWED EIGHT

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.291
CASES WHERE EACH FINE WAS

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:38.493
REDUCED BY MORE THAN $10,000.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.195
AND IN SIX OF THOSE EIGHT CASES,

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.330
CAL OSHA LACKED A RATIONALE OR

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.598
EXPLANATION FOR THE MAGNITUDE

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:46.201
OF THE FINE DECREASE. IN ONE

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.003
CASE, TWO WORKERS SUFFERED

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:50.205
AMPUTATIONS BECAUSE OF A TREE

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.840
TRIMMING ACCIDENT, AND CAL OSHA

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.742
INITIALLY IMPOSED A FINE OF

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:55.443
JUST OVER $36,000, CITING THREE

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.445
SERIOUS VIOLATIONS AND ONE

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:58.280
GENERAL VIOLATION. BUT AFTER

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:02.017
THE EMPLOYER APPEALED, CAL OSHA

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:04.552
REDUCED THE FINE BY 41% FOR A

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:05.420
REDUCTION OF $15,000 TO A

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:08.556
REDUCED FINE OF JUST MORE THAN

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.358
21,000 CAL. OSHA'S CASE NOTES

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.160
DID NOT DOCUMENT ANY EXPLICIT

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:13.595
RATIONALE OR JUSTIFICATION FOR

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.230
THE REDUCTION, BUT THE EVIDENCE

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:17.265
WE REVIEWED NOTED THAT THE

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:18.800
EMPLOYER HAD CLAIMED THAT

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:19.601
MULTIPLE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.469
COULD JEOPARDIZE ITS ABILITY TO

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:23.438
OBTAIN CONTRACTS, AND CAL CAL

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:25.173
OSHA ULTIMATELY VACATED ONE

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.309
SERIOUS VIOLATION AND

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.510
DOWNGRADED ANOTHER SERIOUS

01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:30.779
VIOLATION TO JUST A GENERAL

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.814
VIOLATION. WHILE CAL OSHA

01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:34.015
POLICY SPECIFY THAT DISTRICT

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.283
MANAGERS SHALL DOCUMENT POST

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:37.052
CITATION SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.520
WITH THE EMPLOYER ON A

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.188
PARTICULAR FORM, AND THAT THE

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:40.722
REDUCTIONS DEFINED AMOUNT

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.491
SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED. AGAIN,

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:44.259
THE UNDERLYING RATIONALE AND

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:45.460
REASONS FOR WHY THESE

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.529
REDUCTIONS ARE BEING APPLIED IS

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:48.430
NOT REQUIRED TO BE DOCUMENTED

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:50.532
OR EXPLAINED, SO IT LIMITED OUR

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:52.300
ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:53.201
COMMITTEE WITH INFORMATION ON

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.103
WHY THOSE DECISIONS WERE BEING

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.271
MADE. CAL OSHA POLICY ALSO

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:58.573
DOESN'T CLEARLY SPECIFY HOW

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.441
FINE REDUCTION DECISIONS ARE TO

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:01.109
BE DOCUMENTED AND JUSTIFIED

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:03.378
WHEN ATTORNEYS ARE INVOLVED, OR

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:04.646
WHEN ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:07.882
MAY APPLY. SO OVERALL, IN

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:09.617
CONCLUSION, WITH WITHOUT THE

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:11.619
STAFFING NEEDED TO MEET ITS

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:12.954
WORKLOAD, WITHOUT CLEARLY

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:15.557
UNDERSTOOD AND UPDATED POLICIES

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:16.491
FOR ITS STAFF TO FOLLOW, AND

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:18.159
WITHOUT A RELIABLE WAY TO

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:20.228
MONITOR STAFF PERFORMANCE AND

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:22.063
MANAGE CASELOADS, CAL OSHA MAY

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.199
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:25.400
RESPONDING TO WORKER COMPLAINTS

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:26.901
AND HOLDING EMPLOYERS

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:29.671
ACCOUNTABLE. TO ITS CREDIT, CAL

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:30.905
OSHA ACCEPTED THE AUDIT'S

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:33.208
FINDINGS AND INDICATES IT IS

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:33.775
WORKING TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.744
OUR MANY RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:37.245
FIRST CHANCE TO REVIEW CAL

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:39.314
OSHA'S PROGRESS WILL BE AT OUR

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:40.615
60 DAY MARK, WHICH IS MID

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.350
SEPTEMBER, AND WE LOOK FORWARD

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:44.452
TO REVIEWING CAL OSHA RESPONSES

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:45.220
AND PROVIDING FURTHER UPDATES

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:47.322
AT THAT TIME. I HAVE NICK

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.391
VERSACE, THE AUDIT TEAM LEADER,

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:50.225
WHO ASSISTED WITH THE AUDIT.

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:51.426
WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:53.395
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:54.696
HAVE. THANK YOU, MR. PARKS, AND

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.364
THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK THERE.

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:58.099
AND I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.300
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:00.435
AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:02.504
THAT YOU AND MR. VERSACE DID ON

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.272
THIS AUDIT. AND I WILL FIRST

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:06.341
TURN IT TO MY VICE CHAIR AND

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.776
THEN MY CO-CHAIRS FOR ANY

01:24:07.842 --> 01:24:09.277
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:14.215
I HAVE ONE QUESTION AND YOU

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:17.085
WILL ALSO BE ON THE THE AGENCY.

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:20.021
BUT IN YOUR AUDIT REPORT ON

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:22.557
PAGE 71, YOU HAVE AN APPENDIX B

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.392
WHICH DEALS WITH STAFFING AND

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.494
VACANCY RATES. AND YOU

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:28.730
MENTIONED STAFFING AND VACANCY

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:34.335
RATES IN THE LATEST YEAR IS 20

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:37.238
2324. AND IT SHOWS A 32.3%

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:40.241
VACANCY RATE. AND IN ONE OF THE

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.410
DISCUSSIONS OUTSIDE THIS

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:44.679
HEARING, THERE WAS A QUESTION

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.682
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IN BUDGET

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:49.617
SWEEPS, A BUNCH OF POSITIONS

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:51.286
WERE TAKEN AND THEN IT ALTERED

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.520
THE VACANCY RATE AND IT LOOKED

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.189
LIKE SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING AS

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.724
OPPOSED TO THE POSITIONS BEING

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.259
SWEPT. AND THIS CHART DOESN'T

01:24:58.326 --> 01:25:00.361
TOTALLY REFLECT THAT. SO I WAS

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.197
WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.365
ON MAYBE WHERE IT IS NOW AND

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:06.734
HOW MUCH OF THE LOWERING OF THE

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:08.636
VACANCY RATE IS REALLY THE

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:09.838
SWEEPING OF POSITIONS, AND HOW

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:12.574
MUCH IS THE FACT THAT THEY CAN

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.374
POSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILLED?

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:16.177
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. YES,

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.580
OUR OUR FIVE YEAR AUDIT PERIOD

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.281
STOPPED IN 2324 BECAUSE WE WERE

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:22.784
DOING OUR WORK IN 2425. THAT

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:24.085
WAS THE LAST YEAR, A COMPLETE

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:25.386
YEAR. BUT WITH RESPECT TO YOUR

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:27.255
QUESTION, I REVIEWED THE

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:28.490
MATERIALS THAT CAL OSHA

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:29.224
SUBMITTED IN ADVANCE OF THIS

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.693
HEARING. IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY

01:25:31.759 --> 01:25:34.596
SWEPT OR 66 POSITIONS, ROUGHLY

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:37.465
WERE SWEPT. AND BY DOING THAT,

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:39.767
THAT HAS THE PRACTICAL EFFECT

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:41.169
OF ARTIFICIALLY LOWERING THE

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:43.605
VACANCY RATE AS YOU LOWER

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:44.739
AUTHORIZED POSITIONS. YOU'RE

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:47.542
ALSO REDUCING VACANT POSITIONS.

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:49.944
BUT REDUCING AUTHORIZED

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:50.545
POSITIONS DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:52.247
BEAR ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THE

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:54.315
NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU ACTUALLY

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:55.884
NEED TO DO THE WORK AND TO

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:58.586
HANDLE THE CASELOAD. LESS THAN

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:00.889
A YEAR AGO IN NOVEMBER, CAL

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.724
OSHA HIRED AN EXTERNAL

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:04.792
CONSULTING FIRM TO DO A

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:06.694
WORKLOAD ANALYSIS TO HELP THEM

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.530
IDENTIFY HOW MANY ADDITIONAL

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:10.198
STAFF THEY NEEDED IN ORDER TO

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:12.500
STAY ON TOP OF THEIR INCOMING

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:14.202
WORK, NOT JUST WHAT THEY WERE

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:15.336
HANDLING PRESENTLY, BUT THE

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:17.672
STUFF THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:18.306
ADDRESS IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:20.275
THAT CONSULTANT RECOMMENDED TO

01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:21.743
CAL OSHA THAT THEY NEEDED

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.344
ROUGHLY 265 MORE PEOPLE THAN

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:26.714
THEY DID AT THAT TIME. AND SO I,

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.149
I HAVE AN AUDITOR REVIEWED THE

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:29.417
MATERIALS THAT CAL OSHA

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:31.452
SUBMITTED FOR TODAY'S HEARING.

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:32.453
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ASSERTING

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.423
THEY MAY HAVE HIRED 120, 127

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:37.358
PEOPLE OR SO. IF THAT'S TRUE,

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.327
THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE START. I

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.662
WOULD HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:43.298
WHERE THOSE HIRES ARE APPLIED.

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:45.533
WHAT ROLES ARE THEY SERVING?

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.801
ARE THEY IN THE ENFORCEMENT

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:47.635
BRANCH, WHAT POSITIONS ARE THEY

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:49.671
IN? AND THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.339
THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE ASKING

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:52.574
CAL OSHA ABOUT WHEN WE GET

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.175
THEIR 60 DAY RESPONSE. BUT YES,

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:56.244
THE SWEEPING OF POSITIONS HAS

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:57.345
THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:59.380
LOWERING VACANCY RATES WITHOUT

01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:01.282
REALLY ADDRESSING THE ROOT

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.418
CAUSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:05.520
NEED TO HANDLE WORKLOAD? THANK

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:08.089
YOU. YOU ANTICIPATED MY OTHER

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.291
QUESTION AND YOU ANSWERED IT.

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:12.594
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.362
A HEADS UP FOR THE THE AGENCY.

01:27:14.429 --> 01:27:16.731
WHEN THEY GET UP HERE, WE WILL

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:19.667
REALLY LOOK FOR THEIR TAKE ON

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:20.501
THIS IN THE NUMBERS. AND THE

01:27:20.568 --> 01:27:22.337
REASON IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THOSE

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:25.506
OF US UP HERE IS ONE OF OUR

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.275
QUESTIONS IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:30.745
HELP? AND IT SEEMS TO ME TWO OF

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:32.413
THE ISSUES ARE THE VACANCIES

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.382
AND TRYING TO ASSIST OR

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:36.284
ADEQUATE POSITIONS TO DO IT AND

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:38.519
FRANKLY, ADEQUATE SALARIES,

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.221
BECAUSE IF THE VACANCY RATE IS

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:43.358
REALLY HIGH, BECAUSE WE CAN'T

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.192
RECRUIT AT THE LEVEL OF

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:46.327
SALARIES THAT EXIST, THEN WE

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:48.563
SHOULD FACE INTO THAT QUESTION.

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.932
SO THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:51.933
OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU, MR.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.269
VICE CHAIR, CHAIRWOMAN ORTEGA.

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:59.540
LET'S ASSUME CAL-OSHA IS FULLY

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:00.541
STAFFED. THEY HAVE EVERYTHING

01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:04.712
THEY NEED. WOULD WE STILL HAVE

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:07.215
SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS IF THEY

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:08.750
ONLY ADDRESSED STAFFING? I

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.385
WOULD SAY IT'S LIKELY THEY

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:11.252
WOULD STILL HAVE SOME OF THE

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:12.253
PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.421
ENCOUNTERING TODAY. IT'S NOT

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:15.590
JUST ABOUT STAFF. IT'S ABOUT

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:18.693
HAVING CONSISTENT, UPDATED AND

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.727
CLEARLY, CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.629
EXPECTATIONS FOR STAFF TO

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.398
FOLLOW. THERE ARE POLICIES IN

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:25.199
CAL OSHA'S MANUAL THAT HAVEN'T

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:27.335
BEEN UPDATED FOR 17 PLUS YEARS.

01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:29.437
THAT REFERENCE OUT-OF-DATE

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:31.839
REQUIREMENTS. AND ALSO WHAT'S

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:33.174
PROBLEMATIC HERE IS THAT IT'S

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:34.809
NOT JUST HAVING UPDATED

01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:36.344
POLICIES, BUT IT'S HAVING A

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:38.212
MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:39.814
WHETHER OR NOT YOUR EMPLOYEES

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.983
ARE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THOSE

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.685
UPDATED POLICIES AND PRACTICES.

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:46.921
CAL OSHA PRACTICES ARE LARGELY

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.290
HARDCOPY BASED. THERE ISN'T AN

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:50.558
ELECTRONIC CASE MANAGEMENT

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:52.160
SYSTEM. FILES AREN'T DIGITIZED,

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:53.461
WHICH MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.463
TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR ON AN

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.165
ONGOING BASIS. WHETHER OR NOT

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:59.133
CAL OSHA EMPLOYEES ARE MEETING

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.101
THE EXPECTATIONS AND THE

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:01.302
POLICIES AS THEY'RE DEFINED. SO

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:04.972
IT'S NOT JUST A STAFFING ISSUE.

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:05.573
IT'S THERE'S GOT TO BE CLEAR

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.308
EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:09.410
CAL OSHA EXPECTS ITS STAFF TO

01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:10.344
DO, AND THAT NEEDS TO BE BACKED

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:12.513
UP WITH SOME SORT OF MONITORING

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.115
MECHANISM WHERE CAL OSHA IS IN

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.450
A POSITION TO KNOW WHETHER OR

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:17.652
NOT THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES ARE

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:19.420
ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THROUGH OR

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:21.389
NOT. THANK YOU. SO, I MEAN, THE

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:23.124
WAY I'M LOOKING AT THIS, YOU

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:24.392
KNOW, EVEN IF THEY WERE FULLY

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:26.994
STAFFED, AS YOU MENTIONED,

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:29.230
THEY'RE STILL NOT CLEAR

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:31.999
DIRECTIONS IN TERMS OF THE

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:33.167
LETTERS AND THE INSPECTIONS,

01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:36.471
THE LACK OF CRIMINAL REFERRALS

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:39.607
AND THE SETTING AND THE

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:41.209
REDUCING OF THE FINES. I WANT

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:43.344
TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE IF

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:44.545
IT'S OKAY THROUGH THE CHAIR

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:46.180
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE FAKE

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:47.648
LETTERS, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:49.751
GOING TO CALL THEM, BECAUSE

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.185
THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:54.088
SAVE ANYONE'S LIVES. WHAT IS

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:56.190
THE PROCESS? WHEN DO THEY

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:57.525
DECIDE TO SEND ONE OF THESE

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.160
LETTERS, AND THEN WHAT IS THE

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:00.728
RESULT AND HOW MANY HAVE THEY

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:02.430
SENT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS? I

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:04.232
TURN THAT OVER TO NICK. CAN YOU

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:06.334
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LETTER

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.068
INVESTIGATIONS? YEAH, THANK YOU

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:08.269
FOR THE QUESTION. SO MY NAME IS

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.371
NICK VERSACE. I WAS THE TEAM

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:12.006
LEAD ON THE PROJECT. SO WHEN

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.174
THEY FIRST GET A COMPLAINT IN,

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:14.509
THAT'S WHEN THEY DECIDE WHETHER

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:17.111
IT'S GOING TO GO THROUGH AN ON

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:17.678
SITE INSPECTION OR TO SEND A

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:18.579
LETTER INVESTIGATION. AND THEY

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:20.481
HAVE A POLICY FOR THAT THAT HAS

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:22.150
BEEN UNDER REVISION THAT WE

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:23.284
HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO CLARIFY.

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:24.452
THEY MOSTLY RELY ON LETTER

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:26.187
INVESTIGATIONS IN THE DATA. SO

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.256
YOU ASKED ABOUT THE LAST FIVE

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:29.824
YEARS, IT'S GENERALLY BEEN

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.425
ABOUT 80% OR MORE. IS THE STATE

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:33.294
AUDITOR HAD REFERENCED AS FAR

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:34.395
AS HOW MANY OF THOSE COMPLAINTS

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:36.564
ARE RESOLVED THROUGH LETTER

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:37.331
INVESTIGATIONS. SO THEY'VE BEEN

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:39.467
RELYING ON THAT PROCESS HEAVILY.

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:41.602
AND WE RECOMMEND WAYS TO

01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:42.370
CONDUCT MORE ON SITE

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:46.607
INSPECTIONS INSTEAD. CAN YOU

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:47.875
TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.210
HOW THEY DECIDE AND WHAT'S THE

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:51.379
RESULT OF THESE? SO WE'RE USING

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:54.248
THESE LETTERS 80% OF THE TIME.

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:56.751
WHAT IS THE RESULT OF THESE

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.319
LETTERS. YEAH. SO WHEN THE

01:30:58.386 --> 01:30:59.453
EMPLOYER GETS THE LETTER

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.289
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK INTO

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.925
THE ALLEGATIONS AND RESPOND TO

01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:04.458
CAL OSHA EXPLAINING WHAT

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:06.160
THEY'VE DONE TO ADDRESS AND

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:09.297
CORRECT THOSE HAZARDS. SO WE WE

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:10.531
ACTUALLY HAD FINDINGS IN THE

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:12.633
AUDIT THAT WHEN CAL OSHA GOT

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.502
THE LETTERS BACK, THERE WASN'T

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:15.703
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION,

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.305
ALWAYS IN THOSE RESPONSES. AND

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.373
IN THREE CASES, WE ACTUALLY

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.341
DIDN'T SEE ANY RESPONSE FROM

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:22.476
THE EMPLOYER. SO WE HAD ISSUES

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:24.612
WITH, I BELIEVE, 15 OF THE 24

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:25.847
LETTER INVESTIGATIONS WE

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.415
REVIEWED, THAT THE HAZARDS

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:30.251
ACTUALLY HAD NOT BEEN CORRECTED.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.420
THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:33.354
POINT OUT TO THAT I MENTIONED

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:35.356
IN MY COMMENTS IS WHEN THESE

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:36.290
LETTER INVESTIGATIONS ARE

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:37.959
CONDUCTED, WHEN THE EMPLOYERS

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:38.559
ARE INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES,

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.595
THERE ARE NO FINES OR PENALTIES

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:45.366
THAT CAN ATTACH TO THAT. AND SO

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:47.101
THE DECISION POINT TO DO A

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.502
LETTER INVESTIGATION. IT'S

01:31:48.569 --> 01:31:50.371
ESSENTIALLY A TRADE OFF THAT

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.273
CAL OSHA IS MAKING, WHERE THEY

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.076
MAY ARGUE THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:56.510
ISSUES MORE EXPEDIENTLY BY

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:57.378
HAVING THE EMPLOYER INVESTIGATE

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:59.347
IT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:01.249
POTENTIALLY. BUT ON THE

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:02.516
NEGATIVE SIDE, IT'S REALLY HARD

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:04.352
TO HOLD EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:05.119
WHEN THEY'RE INVESTIGATING

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.787
THEMSELVES AND NO FINES CAN BE

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:09.123
IMPOSED. AND SO I THINK IT'S

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.492
IT'S A TRADE OFF THAT CAL OSHA

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.327
IS MAKING ABOUT WHEN TO DO

01:32:13.394 --> 01:32:14.262
LETTER INVESTIGATIONS AND WHEN

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:16.330
IT'S NOT. AND I THINK A FACTOR

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:18.566
IN THAT IS IT'S DECISIONS ABOUT

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:24.739
HOW TO BEST DEPLOY ITS STAFF.

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:29.176
ON THE ISSUE OF THE FINES. CAN

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:32.613
YOU TELL ME HOW MANY FINES HAVE

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:37.718
BEEN SENT OUT AND HOW THEY WERE

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:42.123
REDUCED? SO WE HAVE A TABLE IN

01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:44.258
OUR AUDIT REPORT. IT'S THE

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:46.794
APPENDIX, IT'S TABLE A5, WHERE

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.095
OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WE

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:49.430
PROVIDE INFORMATION ON WHAT WAS

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:51.832
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE FINES

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:54.335
ASSESSED INITIALLY, AND THEN

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:56.771
WHAT WAS THE AMOUNT AFTER

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:59.006
REDUCTIONS AND THEN HOW MUCH

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:00.474
WAS ACTUALLY COLLECTED. AND SO

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:02.310
IN THAT TABLE, AND I'LL JUST

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:04.879
LOOK AT FISCAL YEAR 1920, THE

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.213
FIRST YEAR, AS AN EXAMPLE, WE

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.683
SHOW THAT CAL OSHA INITIALLY

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:11.652
ASSESSED FINES OF ROUGHLY $40.7

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:15.156
MILLION AFTER REDUCTIONS

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:17.358
THROUGH SETTLEMENTS AND OTHER

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.626
PROCESSES, THAT AMOUNT WAS

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:21.629
REDUCED TO 28.2 MILLION IN

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:23.564
FINES ASSESSED. AND OF THAT

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:26.334
AMOUNT, $20.4 MILLION HAD

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.570
ACTUALLY BEEN COLLECTED. NOW,

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:32.139
THE FURTHER OUT YOU GO IN YEARS,

01:33:32.206 --> 01:33:33.674
THE CLOSER YOU GET TO

01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:36.444
COLLECTIONS BEING MORE EQUAL TO

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:37.678
THE AMOUNT OF THE FINES

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:39.513
ACTUALLY ASSESSED. AND THE MORE

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.549
RECENT YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, IN

01:33:41.615 --> 01:33:43.484
2324, YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE

01:33:43.551 --> 01:33:46.687
WAS $30.6 MILLION ASSESSED

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:49.457
AFTER REDUCTIONS AND ONLY 7.9

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.258
MILLION HAD BEEN COLLECTED. AND

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:52.860
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.462
EXPLANATIONS FOR THAT. PART OF

01:33:54.528 --> 01:33:56.263
IT CAN BE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE ON

01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:57.531
PAYMENT PLANS, AND SO THEY

01:33:57.598 --> 01:33:59.700
DON'T PAY THE ENTIRE AMOUNT

01:33:59.767 --> 01:34:01.402
RIGHT AWAY. SOMETIMES THERE'S

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:03.437
COLLECTIONS THAT ARE APPLIED

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:05.339
FOR EMPLOYERS, AND THEN ALSO

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:07.341
EMPLOYERS AT TIMES GO BANKRUPT

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.275
AND YOU NEVER COLLECT THE FULL

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:10.411
AMOUNT. AND SO IT WASN'T

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:12.113
SURPRISING TO US THE FURTHER

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:14.215
BACK IN TIME YOU GO TO THAT

01:34:14.281 --> 01:34:16.350
1920 FISCAL YEAR, YOU GET AN

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:17.985
AMOUNT THAT'S CLOSER TO THE

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.820
AMOUNT OF FINES THAT ARE

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:21.589
IMPOSED. SO WHEN I LOOKED AT

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:24.392
THIS CHART, YOU KNOW, ONE OF

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:26.227
THE THINGS THAT STOOD OUT WAS

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:28.396
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS LOOKED

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:31.198
LIKE MORE THAN 8000 FINES WERE

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:35.236
REDUCED BY MORE THAN 56% OR

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:41.475
MORE. YOU'RE COMPARING THE

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:43.511
AMOUNT OF THE FINES INITIALLY

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:45.279
ASSESSED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:47.348
THE FINES CURRENTLY ASSESSED.

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:48.582
CORRECT? RIGHT. AND AS I

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:50.284
MENTIONED IN MY PRESENTATION,

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.552
WHEN WE LOOKED AT INDIVIDUAL

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:53.320
CASE FILES, WE HAD EXAMPLES

01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:56.357
WHERE FINES WERE REDUCED 40% OR

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:57.625
MORE AND THERE WASN'T CLEAR

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:59.260
EXPLANATION OR DOCUMENTATION IN

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:01.362
THE CASE FILES JUSTIFYING THAT

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:03.330
DECREASE. AND SO OUR ABILITY TO

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:05.900
COMMENT ON WHY THOSE REDUCTIONS

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:07.134
ARE OCCURRING IS LIMITED BASED

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:09.336
ON THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE

01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:10.571
THAT EXISTS IN COLOSSIANS

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:13.374
RECORDS. SO RIGHT NOW, YOU

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:14.542
COULDN'T TELL ME WHO MADE THE

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:16.177
DECISIONS AND WHY. NÓ. CORRECT.

01:35:16.243 --> 01:35:18.345
OKAY. I'LL BE ASKING THAT. AND

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:22.249
THEN ONE LAST QUESTION. CAN YOU

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:26.854
TELL ME HOW MANY SERIOUS CASES

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:28.789
WERE REFERRED FOR CRIMINAL

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:31.325
PROSECUTION? YEAH, THANK YOU

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:33.594
FOR THE QUESTION. SO I THINK WE

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:36.330
SAY IN THE REPORT IT'S ABOUT 7

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:38.132
OR 8 PER YEAR ARE ACTUALLY

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.400
REFERRED FOR CRIMINAL

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:41.268
PROSECUTION. IN THE FIVE YEARS

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:43.871
WE LOOKED AT, I THINK IT WAS 31

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:46.407
OR 32 TOTAL. AND SO THAT CAME

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:48.309
TO AN AVERAGE OF 1.7% OF

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:51.078
SERIOUS CASES. I DON'T KNOW

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:52.346
THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE AVERAGE,

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:54.381
BUT YES, IT'S VERY LOW. YEAH.

01:35:54.448 --> 01:35:56.650
VERY LOW. AND AGAIN, WHAT WAS

01:35:56.717 --> 01:35:59.320
HOW DOES ONE GET REFERRED.

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:01.188
WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DECISION

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:03.958
MAKING PROCESS. YEAH. SO THE

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:05.226
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS LOOKS

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:07.328
LOOKS AT THOSE CASES FOR

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:08.963
POTENTIAL REFERRAL. SO THEY GET

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:11.232
NOTIFIED OF A CASE WITH A

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:12.433
SERIOUS VIOLATION AND A

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.568
FATALITY OR SERIOUS INJURY TO

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:15.803
FIVE OR MORE WORKERS. THEY

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.404
INVESTIGATE THOSE CASES AND

01:36:17.471 --> 01:36:19.273
THEN DECIDE WHETHER TO REFER

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.575
THE CASE TO LOCAL PROSECUTORS.

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.811
THEY ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:25.880
LOOK AT SERIOUS INJURIES THAT

01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:27.581
ARE NOT FATALITIES. SO WE

01:36:27.648 --> 01:36:28.449
REALLY HAD TWO CONCERNS IN THE

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:30.584
AUDIT. ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:32.219
THE BUREAU AT THE TIME OF OUR

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:34.221
AUDIT DID NOT HAVE POLICIES AND

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:36.090
PROCEDURES EXPLAINING. HOW DO

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:37.391
YOU DOCUMENT THAT REASONING FOR

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:39.393
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.561
INVESTIGATE A CASE AND THEN

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.129
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:44.932
REFER IT? SO THAT WAS OUR

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:46.200
RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU.

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:48.502
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:50.838
CHAIRWOMAN SMALLWOOD CUEVAS

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:53.474
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND THANK

01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:57.278
YOU FOR THAT. THAT THOROUGH

01:36:57.344 --> 01:36:59.246
OVERVIEW. I JUST I HAVE A FEW

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:02.416
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR YOU. SO

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:04.351
YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:06.353
THE VACANCIES, AND I UNDERSTAND

01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:08.189
YOUR ANSWER TO SENATOR LAIRD'S

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:10.357
QUESTION ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:13.727
ACCOUNTS FOR FOR LOWER VACANCY

01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:16.497
RATE. I WAS STILL CONFUSED

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:18.966
ABOUT HOW YOU FOUND THAT WE HAD

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:23.304
A RATE OF 32% IN 23, 24, AND

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:25.172
THEN NOTE THAT, YOU KNOW, BY

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:28.409
MAY 31ST, 2020, 25, POSITIONS

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:30.344
ACROSS THE DIVISION WAS AT

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:34.615
ABOUT 12%. AND CONFUSED ABOUT

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.850
WHAT WHY THE DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:39.453
DATA? AND HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.690
TO REVIEW DURR'S EVIDENCE OF

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:43.524
IMPROVED VACANCY RATES? AND

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:46.260
WHAT CAN YOU SHARE ABOUT THE

01:37:46.327 --> 01:37:47.428
DIFFERENTIATION? THANK YOU FOR

01:37:47.494 --> 01:37:49.330
THE QUESTION. JUST TO CLARIFY

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:51.832
FOR EVERYONE, THE 12% VACANCY

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:54.168
NUMBER IS NOT OUR NUMBER. IT

01:37:54.235 --> 01:37:56.470
WASN'T PART OF OUR AUDIT. OUR

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:59.240
AUDIT PERIOD ENDED IN 2324. AND

01:37:59.306 --> 01:38:00.474
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CAL

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.176
OSHA IS ASSERTING THAT 12%

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:05.846
VACANCY RATE IS 2425. AND SO

01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:07.381
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'LL BE

01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:09.550
DOING WHEN WE GET CAL OSHA'S 60

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:11.318
DAY, SIX MONTHS AND ONE YEAR

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:12.820
RESPONSES WILL BE ASKING

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:14.121
QUESTIONS AND SEEKING EVIDENCE

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:16.624
ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:18.092
ACTUALLY HIRING AND WHAT

01:38:18.158 --> 01:38:19.593
POSITIONS ARE YOU HIRING THEM

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.595
INTO. AND SO WITHOUT BEING ABLE

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:23.197
TO SEE THE UNDERLYING DATA, I'M

01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:25.399
JUST NOT IN A POSITION TO

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:27.801
COMMENT ON THAT 12% FIGURE. SO

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:29.436
WE'LL SEE THAT IN THE SEPTEMBER

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:31.272
UPDATE. THAT WILL BE CLARIFIED.

01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:33.173
OKAY. PERFECT. JUST A FOLLOW UP

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.077
QUESTION ON THAT. WE KNOW. ALSO,

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:39.913
SINCE THAT TIME OUR BUDGET HAS

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.182
LOOKED BECOME MORE AND MORE DIM

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:44.351
OUR OUTLYING YEARS AND

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:47.655
PROSPECTS. SO I'M CURIOUS THAT

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:50.424
ABOUT THIS DATA, WHERE THERE

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:53.294
SEEMS TO BE MANY POSITIONS THAT

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:57.064
ARE TO BE ELIMINATED AT DER IN

01:38:57.131 --> 01:39:01.235
THE 2526 FISCAL YEAR, AND MANY

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:03.570
WITHIN CAL OSHA IN PARTICULAR,

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:04.338
AND SOME IN THE INDUSTRIAL

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:06.240
HYGIENIST SPACE, WHICH IS WHERE

01:39:06.307 --> 01:39:07.341
THE REAL ENFORCEMENT, THE

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:08.175
GROUND LEVEL ENFORCEMENT IS

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:10.611
HAPPENING. IT'S THE FIRST STEP

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.513
IN THE PROCESS. AND SO GIVEN

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:13.947
WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:15.349
AUDIT, HOW DETRIMENTAL WOULD IT

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:18.319
BE FOR US TO SEE AN ELIMINATION

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:20.287
OF THESE POSITIONS,

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:22.122
PARTICULARLY THAT ONE, AS IT

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:23.357
RELATES TO ENSURING SAFETY FOR

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:25.259
FAMILIES? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:28.228
WE'RE GOING TO CHECK, YOU KNOW,

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:29.330
THE DISCREPANCY. BUT NOW WE

01:39:29.396 --> 01:39:31.532
HAVE ANOTHER LAYER OF CUTS THAT

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.901
ARE BEING PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:36.603
POSITIONS. THANK YOU. THE

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:38.305
INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST POSITION,

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:40.074
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY, WAS ONE

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.675
OF THE POSITIONS IN CAL OSHA

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.310
THAT HAD THE HIGHEST VACANCY

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.079
RATES. AND SO NOT FILLING THOSE

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:47.081
POSITIONS WOULD BE INCREDIBLY

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:48.482
PROBLEMATIC. IN FACT, I BELIEVE

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:50.351
WHEN CAL OSHA'S CONSULTANT CAME

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:52.486
IN AND SAID YOU NEEDED 265 MORE

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:54.555
PEOPLE, THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:56.623
THOSE POSITIONS WERE FOR

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.525
INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS. AND SO

01:39:58.592 --> 01:40:00.260
ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:02.429
HAVE IN OUR AUDIT REPORT IS,

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:03.230
CAL OSHA REALLY NEEDS TO GO

01:40:03.297 --> 01:40:05.466
FINAL AS QUICK AS IT CAN IN

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:06.633
MAKING A DECISION. NOW THAT

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.302
IT'S GOT IT'S FEEDBACK FROM ITS

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:10.371
CONSULTANT ABOUT JUST HOW MANY

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:12.206
PEOPLE DO YOU NEED TO HANDLE

01:40:12.272 --> 01:40:14.308
THE WORKLOAD THAT YOU HAVE. I'M

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.677
HOPEFUL THAT IN THE LONGER TERM,

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.479
AS IT GETS ITS CASE MANAGEMENT

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:20.481
SYSTEM, MAYBE IT CAN ACHIEVE

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:21.248
SOME MORE EFFICIENCIES AND

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:23.283
PERHAPS WON'T NEED THE FULL

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:24.551
COMPLEMENT OF PEOPLE. BUT AS OF

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.286
TODAY, BASED ON THE PRACTICES

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:27.521
AND THE POLICIES THAT IT

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:29.456
FOLLOWS, CLEARLY THEY HAVE A

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:31.325
NEED FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:32.559
ADDITIONAL STAFF. AND IT SOUNDS

01:40:32.626 --> 01:40:34.194
LIKE BASED ON CAL OSHA'S

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:36.363
RESPONSE TODAY, THEY'RE MAKING

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:37.498
PROGRESS TOWARDS HIRING

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.199
ADDITIONAL FOLKS. THANK YOU FOR

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:44.138
THAT. SO THIS AUDIT JUST REALLY

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:46.340
SHINE LIGHT ON ALL OF THE

01:40:46.407 --> 01:40:48.175
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:51.745
PROCEDURAL PROCESS FOR

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:53.847
INVESTIGATING, INSPECTING,

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:56.350
FOLLOW UP, THE FINES AND

01:40:56.417 --> 01:41:00.320
CITATIONS, SO MANY FACTORS THAT

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:02.489
THAT THAT THIS AUDIT LOOKED AT

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:04.525
AND FOUND SOME GAPING HOLES IN

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:06.493
THE WAY IN WHICH THIS WORK IS

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:09.830
BEING DONE, AS YOU AS YOU THINK

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:12.399
ABOUT THE BROAD SORT OF SET OF

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:14.535
OF AREAS THAT NEED TO BE

01:41:14.601 --> 01:41:16.203
ADDRESSED, WHERE WOULD YOU SAY

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:19.840
CAL OSHA NEEDS TO FOCUS MOST OF

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:21.442
ITS ATTENTION, ITS RESOURCES,

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:24.111
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:26.013
FROM WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW,

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:27.381
WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE IN SO

01:41:27.448 --> 01:41:29.249
MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN LAID OUT

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:32.219
HERE IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, HOW

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:34.288
WE ARE HEARING FROM WORKERS AND

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:36.390
COLLECTING THEIR INFORMATION TO

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:38.659
HOW WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:41.395
EMPLOYERS TO HOW WE ARE

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:43.163
IDENTIFYING THE SEVERITY OF

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:47.568
CASES, TO IMPLEMENTING THE FINE

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:49.636
REGIME, AND SO MUCH SO, SO, SO

01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:51.572
ON AND SO FORTH. YOU KNOW, YOU

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:52.439
GOT TO EAT THIS ELEPHANT ONE

01:41:52.506 --> 01:41:55.542
BITE AT A TIME IN ORDER TO BE

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:58.378
ABLE TO SEE CONCRETE CHANGE.

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.280
WHERE WOULD YOU FOCUS? WHAT

01:42:00.347 --> 01:42:04.384
WOULD BE TOP, YOU KNOW, 2 OR 3

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:05.219
PRIORITIES THAT YOU THINK THE

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:06.253
DEPARTMENT REALLY NEEDS TO

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.055
DRILL DOWN IN? AND CAN YOU

01:42:08.121 --> 01:42:10.791
SHARE SOME SENSE OF WHAT WOULD

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:12.359
BE THE SEQUENCE OF THAT IN

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:14.161
TERMS OF BEING MOST EFFECTIVE?

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:16.463
I THINK IT'S A IT'S A SHORT

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:17.664
TERM AND LONG TERM DISCUSSION.

01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:20.234
I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM THEY

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.535
REALLY NEED TO SOLIDIFY AND

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:24.271
MAKE CONSISTENT WHAT ARE THEIR

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:26.073
EXPECTATIONS FOR THEIR

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:28.609
EMPLOYEES? WHEN ARE YOU GOING

01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:29.643
OUT TO DO INSPECTIONS VERSUS

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:33.213
WHEN ARE YOU NOT? WE ARE OFTEN

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.649
SEEING IN THE CASE FILES CAL

01:42:35.716 --> 01:42:37.417
OSHA EMPLOYEES APPLYING THEIR

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:39.286
OWN DISCRETION AND SOMETIMES

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:41.221
EMPLOYEES IN DIFFERENT OFFICES

01:42:41.288 --> 01:42:42.422
COMING TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:44.358
ABOUT WHAT'S AN ACCIDENT

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:45.292
RELATED CASE VERSUS WHAT'S JUST

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:48.362
A GENERAL VIOLATION. AND SO I

01:42:48.428 --> 01:42:49.263
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARITY

01:42:49.329 --> 01:42:52.666
IN CAL OSHA'S POLICIES AND THE

01:42:52.733 --> 01:42:53.433
TRAINING FOR ITS EMPLOYEES SO

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.168
THAT EVERYBODY'S OPERATING OFF

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:57.404
OF THE SAME PAGE, SO TO SPEAK.

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:59.339
CAL OSHA HAS HIRED A POLICY

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:01.441
WRITER TO HELP THEM UPDATE

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:03.410
THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:05.445
AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:07.447
SEEING SORT OF WHAT THE

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:08.282
TIMELINE EXPECTATION IS FOR CAL

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:10.417
OSHA IN THAT REGARD. BUT I

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:12.119
THINK THE PROBLEMS THAT CAL

01:43:12.185 --> 01:43:14.388
OSHA IS FACING IS REALLY A SORT

01:43:14.454 --> 01:43:16.557
OF A THREE LEGGED STOOL. THE

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:18.292
FIRST ONE IS YOU GOT TO HAVE

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:20.360
THE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK. THE

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:21.328
SECOND LEG OF THE STOOL IS

01:43:21.395 --> 01:43:22.396
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:24.431
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO. AND THE

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.166
THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL IS CAL

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:27.234
OSHA MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO BE IN

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:29.369
A POSITION TO KNOW WHETHER OR

01:43:29.436 --> 01:43:30.404
NOT THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:31.505
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THOSE

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:32.272
EXPECTATIONS, AND CURRENTLY, WE

01:43:32.339 --> 01:43:34.575
DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE THREE

01:43:34.641 --> 01:43:36.877
LEGS FULLY FLESHED OUT. IN OUR

01:43:36.944 --> 01:43:38.579
OPINION. WE HAVE STAFFING THAT

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:40.247
NEEDS TO INCREASE. WE NEED

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:42.482
STAFF THAT NEED TO KNOW WHAT

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:44.151
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO AND WHEN

01:43:44.217 --> 01:43:46.286
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO IT. AND

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:49.323
CAL OSHA IS HOPING THAT THROUGH

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:51.358
ITS CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:53.360
IT HOPES TO HAVE COME ONLINE IN

01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:55.629
2026. ALTHOUGH IN THE AUDIT

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:57.497
REPORT, THEY TOLD US 2027 THAT

01:43:57.564 --> 01:43:58.231
THEY'LL BE BETTER POSITIONED TO

01:43:58.298 --> 01:43:59.399
MAKE SURE THERE IS GREATER

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:01.068
CONSISTENCY IN THE CASE FILES

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:02.369
AND THAT THEY CAN MONITOR

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.838
WHETHER OR NOT EMPLOYERS OR

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:05.939
EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:08.575
FOLLOWING THROUGH IN TERMS OF

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:09.676
HOW CASES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:44:09.743 --> 01:44:11.311
HANDLED. BUT IN THE INTERIM,

01:44:11.378 --> 01:44:13.280
BEFORE THAT CASE SYSTEM IS

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:15.148
OPERATIONAL, I THINK IT'S A

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:16.316
REALLY GOOD IDEA. AND WE MADE A

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:17.451
RECOMMENDATION TO THIS REGARD,

01:44:17.517 --> 01:44:19.486
IS THAT CAL, OSHA'S OWN

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:20.654
INTERNAL AUDITS UNIT NEEDS TO

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:22.756
DO CONTINUAL REOCCURRING AUDITS

01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:24.257
OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:26.727
ENFORCEMENT BRANCH IN UNIT TO

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:28.195
MAKE SURE THAT AS CAL OSHA IS

01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:29.830
MAKING THESE INCREMENTAL

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:31.331
CHANGES, THAT THERE IS A A

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:32.633
MONITORING MECHANISM THROUGH

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:34.701
INTERNAL AUDITS TO REPORT BACK

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:36.970
TO MANAGEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:37.537
WHAT THEY'RE SEEING ON THE

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:39.172
GROUND IS ACTUALLY BEING

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:44.611
IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE. THAT

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:48.448
IS. A REAL WORK PLAN THAT NEEDS

01:44:48.515 --> 01:44:50.684
TO BE SET UP AND FOLLOWED. AND

01:44:50.751 --> 01:44:52.886
I APPRECIATE YOU LAYING THAT

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:55.389
OUT. AND CERTAINLY IT'S GOING

01:44:55.455 --> 01:44:57.157
TO BE INCUMBENT UPON US TO

01:44:57.224 --> 01:44:58.392
ENSURE THAT THOSE STEPS GET

01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:01.194
FOLLOWED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

01:45:01.261 --> 01:45:06.333
AND. INCREDIBLE THAT AN AGENCY

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.335
THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR

01:45:08.402 --> 01:45:09.970
DECADES DOESN'T HAVE ANY LEGS

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:13.540
TO IT'S STOOL. I MY FINAL

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:16.410
QUESTION HERE HAS TO DO WITH

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:22.215
THE FINES AND. YOU KNOW,

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:24.217
FEDERAL OSHA FOUND THAT

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:26.386
ALTHOUGH CAL OSHA HAD A HIGHER

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:28.889
FINE BASE AMOUNT FOR SERIOUS

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:31.425
VIOLATIONS, THE AVERAGE FINE

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:33.727
THAT CAL OSHA HAS IS LEVYING

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:36.396
PER INSPECTION WAS BELOW THE

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:38.265
NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND TO ME,

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:42.169
THAT MEANS THE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:45:42.235 --> 01:45:44.504
EDGE IS DULL. WE'RE NOT WE'RE

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:46.306
NOT USING THAT TO ITS FULLEST

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:48.642
POTENTIAL, AND WE'RE MISSING

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:49.643
OUT ON THE RESOURCES COMING

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:52.946
BACK TO FUEL AND FUND THE

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:55.182
ENFORCEMENT. HOW HOW DOES CAL

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:57.718
OSHA'S AVERAGE FINES COMPARE TO

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:59.486
THOSE IN OTHER STATES,

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:00.253
ESPECIALLY STATES THAT HAVE

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.289
FEWER LABOR PROTECTIONS THAN

01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:04.658
CALIFORNIA? I DID NOTICE IN THE

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:06.426
REPORT THERE WERE JUST IN TERMS

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:08.528
OF JUST THE SIMPLEST THINGS, IN

01:46:08.595 --> 01:46:10.363
TERMS OF INTAKE, YOU KNOW,

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.299
PLACES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA HAD

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:15.268
FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS OF

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:16.636
RECEIVING WORKER COMPLAINTS AND

01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:18.338
INTAKE, WHICH WAS WAS WHICH WAS

01:46:18.405 --> 01:46:20.507
SHOCKING TO ME. SO I'M JUST

01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:22.809
CURIOUS, HAS THERE BEEN ANY

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.311
ASSESSMENT NATIONALLY IN

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:26.446
LOOKING AT HOW STATES ARE

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:27.280
OUTPACING US IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:46:27.347 --> 01:46:29.750
KINDS OF FINES ARE BEING

01:46:29.816 --> 01:46:30.550
COLLECTED TO SUPPORT

01:46:30.617 --> 01:46:32.385
ENFORCEMENT? YEAH. SO I MAY

01:46:32.452 --> 01:46:34.488
START OFF WITH A GENERAL ANSWER,

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:36.223
BUT I MAY NEED TO RELY ON ON

01:46:36.289 --> 01:46:38.492
NICK TO TO FOLLOW UP. WE FOCUS

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:41.194
PRIMARILY ON CAL OSHA AND ITS

01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:42.429
APPLICATION OF FINES. AND SO I

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:44.297
AGAIN, I COME BACK TO, YOU KNOW,

01:46:44.364 --> 01:46:46.299
AS AUDITORS WE WANT TO SEE

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:47.801
DOCUMENTATION. WE WANT TO SEE

01:46:47.868 --> 01:46:49.169
EXPLANATION RATIONALES FOR THE

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.337
DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE,

01:46:50.403 --> 01:46:52.339
ESPECIALLY WHEN FINES ARE BEING

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:54.474
REDUCED BY, IN SOME CASES 40%

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:57.410
OR MORE. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:46:57.477 --> 01:46:59.179
THAT RATIONALE SO THAT YOU CAN

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.413
UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT CAL

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.482
OSHA EMPLOYEES ARE FOLLOWING

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:03.416
POLICY, OR IF THERE'S SOME

01:47:03.483 --> 01:47:05.385
FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF

01:47:05.452 --> 01:47:06.686
HOW THE FINE CALCULATION

01:47:06.753 --> 01:47:08.355
PROCESS WORKS. AND I THINK

01:47:08.421 --> 01:47:10.257
THROUGHOUT OUR AUDIT, WHAT WE

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:13.426
FOUND WAS CAL OSHA AND THEIR

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:15.495
STAFF JUST AREN'T DOING AS

01:47:15.562 --> 01:47:17.664
GREAT OF A JOB AS THEY NEED TO

01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:19.332
BE DOING TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:20.066
THESE REDUCTIONS THAT WE'RE

01:47:20.133 --> 01:47:21.835
SEEING. WE WALKED YOU THROUGH

01:47:21.902 --> 01:47:23.403
AN EXAMPLE WHERE YOU HAD A

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:25.272
PERSON WHO WAS KILLED IN A

01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:28.375
FORKLIFT ACCIDENT, AND THE CAL

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:30.277
OSHA EMPLOYEE IS CALLING IT A

01:47:30.343 --> 01:47:32.779
GENERAL FINE WITH A 2000 BASE

01:47:32.846 --> 01:47:34.648
FINE AMOUNT. AND WHEN WE DO OUR

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:37.017
CALCULATION, OUR BASE FINE

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:38.518
AMOUNT IS $18,000, BECAUSE

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:39.653
WE'RE CALLING IT A SERIOUS

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:41.454
ACCIDENT THAT HAS A FATALITY.

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:43.290
AND SO I THINK THERE'S A

01:47:43.356 --> 01:47:45.292
THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF TRAINING

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:46.259
THAT'S REQUIRED. THERE'S AN

01:47:46.326 --> 01:47:48.829
ELEMENT OF DOCUMENTATION TO

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:49.896
EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE, SO THAT

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:50.697
WHEN MANAGERS ARE LOOKING

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.132
THROUGH THE CASE FILES, THEY'RE

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:53.266
IN A BETTER POSITION TO

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:54.901
UNDERSTAND WHAT DECISIONS ARE

01:47:54.968 --> 01:47:56.303
BEING MADE. BUT WITH RESPECT TO

01:47:56.369 --> 01:47:58.305
YOUR QUESTION OF WHAT ARE OTHER

01:47:58.371 --> 01:47:59.506
STATES DOING, NICK, I DON'T

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:00.707
KNOW IF WE HAD ADDITIONAL

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:02.309
INFORMATION ON THAT IN THE

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.344
AUDIT. YEAH. SO THE MAIN SOURCE

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:05.312
THAT WE FOUND AND RELIED ON WAS

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:07.581
THAT THAT FEDERAL OSHA

01:48:07.647 --> 01:48:08.448
STATISTIC YOU MENTIONED. AND

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:10.584
AGAIN, IT BASICALLY SHOWS THAT

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:12.352
IN GENERAL, CALIFORNIA DOES

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:15.121
KIND OF SET HIGH FINE AMOUNTS

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:16.323
IN LAW AND REGULATION. THAT'S

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:18.058
WHAT WE KIND OF SHOW IN THE

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:19.326
REPORT. BUT IN PRACTICE THE

01:48:19.392 --> 01:48:21.394
AVERAGE FINES ARE LOWER THAN IN

01:48:21.461 --> 01:48:24.197
MANY OTHER STATES. AND AS THE

01:48:24.264 --> 01:48:25.332
STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED, WE WE

01:48:25.398 --> 01:48:26.566
FOCUSED ON TWO THINGS IN

01:48:26.633 --> 01:48:28.201
PARTICULAR, WHICH WAS SETTING

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:30.403
HIGHER FINES INITIALLY USING

01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:32.072
THE AUTHORITY IN LAW AND

01:48:32.138 --> 01:48:34.207
REGULATIONS AND THEN NOT

01:48:34.274 --> 01:48:35.342
REDUCING THEM WITHOUT A REALLY

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:38.578
GOOD REASON. THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:41.114
AND THE AGENCY HAS TO KEEP PACE

01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:44.351
WITH THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA.

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:46.286
WE ARE PASSING POLICIES EVERY

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:47.854
DAY TO STRENGTHEN THE

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:49.489
PROTECTION OF WORKERS, THEIR

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:50.357
HEALTH AND THEIR SAFETY ON THE

01:48:50.423 --> 01:48:52.392
JOB. THE AGENCY HAS TO KEEP

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:55.495
PACE WITH THAT AND TO HEAR THAT

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:58.431
WE ARE LEVYING, LEVYING THESE

01:48:58.498 --> 01:49:00.300
FINES LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:02.669
AVERAGE, WHICH MEANS WE'RE

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:03.536
COLLECTING LESS ON A NATIONAL

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:06.873
AVERAGE. WE WOULD DRAW THAT

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.475
CONCLUSION IS, IS IS

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:11.611
UNACCEPTABLE, AND IT'S A

01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:13.480
DISSERVICE TO OUR WORKING

01:49:13.546 --> 01:49:16.349
FAMILIES. IT'S A DISSERVICE TO

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:18.218
THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA WHO

01:49:18.285 --> 01:49:20.820
WANT TO SEE A LEVEL PLAYING

01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:22.088
FIELD FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:25.959
DOING THE RIGHT THING, AND IT

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:28.328
UNDERMINES THE ABILITY FOR THE

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:30.463
STATE TO HAVE ROBUST AND

01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:32.265
VIGOROUS ON THE GROUND

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:34.701
ENFORCEMENT TO PROTECT WORKERS.

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:38.438
THANK YOU FOR YOUR EVIDENCE AND

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:40.507
TESTIMONY TODAY, AND I LOOK

01:49:40.573 --> 01:49:42.342
FORWARD TO THE SEPTEMBER

01:49:42.409 --> 01:49:43.476
UPDATES THAT YOU WILL HAVE IN

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:46.713
THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:49.449
CHAIR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA,

01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:52.319
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:55.555
AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE CHAIRS

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:57.691
AND THE STAFF FROM MOORLACH AND

01:49:57.757 --> 01:49:59.659
RESPECTIVE LABOR COMMITTEES FOR

01:49:59.726 --> 01:50:00.593
ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.362
SPECIAL THANK YOU TO CHAIR

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:04.364
ORTEGA. FOR FORWARDING THIS

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:06.132
AUDIT REQUEST AND TO OUR

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:08.301
AUDITOR AND HIS TEAM FOR A

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:11.071
GREAT REPORT. A LOT OF REALLY

01:50:11.137 --> 01:50:12.138
WONDERFUL QUESTIONS FROM

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:14.374
COLLEAGUES. I JUST WANT TO DO A

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:16.109
LITTLE BIT OF FOLLOW UP ON WHAT

01:50:16.176 --> 01:50:17.477
WAS JUST BEING DISCUSSED

01:50:17.544 --> 01:50:21.214
REGARDING FINES AND PENALTIES.

01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:24.084
HAVE THE FINES THE BASE OR

01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:26.319
MAXIMUM FINES? HOW LONG HAVE

01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:28.788
THEY BEEN SET AT THE CURRENT

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:32.325
LEVEL? WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:33.493
INFORMATION AT OUR FINGERTIPS,

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.361
BUT WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:36.329
AFTER THIS HEARING IF YOU'D

01:50:36.396 --> 01:50:38.331
LIKE. AND DO YOU KNOW, ARE YOU

01:50:38.398 --> 01:50:41.368
AWARE OF WHERE THE FINES GO

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:43.503
WHEN A FINE IS PAID, WHETHER IT

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:44.304
GOES BACK INTO ENFORCEMENT OR

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:46.673
WHAT HAVE YOU? YEAH. THANK YOU

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:48.208
FOR THE QUESTION. I BELIEVE

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:49.409
THEY GO BACK TO THE GENERAL

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:52.012
FUND, BUT WE CAN WE CAN CLARIFY

01:50:52.078 --> 01:50:53.313
THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU. OKAY.

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.647
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S AN

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:55.648
IMPORTANT POINT WHEN WE'RE

01:50:55.715 --> 01:50:57.484
DOING THE INVESTIGATIONS TO

01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:59.319
ENSURE THAT WE'RE REPLENISHING

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:03.289
THE INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS THAT

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:06.526
WILL THEN LEAD HOPEFULLY TO

01:51:06.593 --> 01:51:10.130
EITHER BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:11.464
THE QUALITY OF THE WORKPLACES

01:51:11.531 --> 01:51:14.501
OR MORE FINES TO FURTHER

01:51:14.567 --> 01:51:16.436
BOLSTER INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES.

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:18.271
I THINK THAT IF FOLKS DON'T

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:21.641
FEEL THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:24.244
GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:28.181
PENALTY, THAT IS. SOMEWHAT

01:51:28.248 --> 01:51:30.683
COMMENSURATE TO THE CONDUCT,

01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:32.085
THERE REALLY ISN'T A

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:33.586
DISINCENTIVE FOR THEM TO

01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:34.721
CONTINUE THAT CONDUCT. YOU

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:37.824
MENTIONED BANKRUPTCIES

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:40.060
ABSOLVING THE DEBT OF SOME OF

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:43.229
THESE EMPLOYERS. I IMAGINE THAT

01:51:43.296 --> 01:51:44.597
ON THE LIST OF CREDITORS IN THE

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:46.266
BANKRUPTCY, THAT THESE FINES OR

01:51:46.332 --> 01:51:48.268
FEES MAY NOT BE PRIMARY

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:50.570
CREDITORS OR, YOU KNOW, HOW ARE

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:52.472
THEY ABSOLVING THEMSELVES OF

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:54.607
THIS PARTICULAR LIABILITY WHEN

01:51:54.674 --> 01:51:56.476
THEY GO THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY

01:51:56.543 --> 01:51:58.478
PROCESS? BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES

01:51:58.545 --> 01:51:59.846
FOLKS WILL GO THROUGH A

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:01.414
BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AND REINVENT

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.383
THEMSELVES. AND NOW THEY'VE

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:04.317
GOTTEN AWAY WITH NOT HAVING TO

01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:07.921
PAY THE FINES. YEAH. SO IN OUR

01:52:07.987 --> 01:52:09.556
APPENDIX, WHEN WE'RE EXPLAINING

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:10.490
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:12.425
AMOUNTS ASSESSED AND THE

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:14.227
AMOUNTS COLLECTED, WE EXPLAIN

01:52:14.294 --> 01:52:15.462
THAT BANKRUPTCIES IS ONE

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:17.130
POTENTIAL REASON FOR WHY

01:52:17.197 --> 01:52:19.299
THERE'S THE DIFFERENCE, WHY THE

01:52:19.365 --> 01:52:20.467
AMOUNTS IMPOSED AREN'T

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:22.168
COLLECTED IN FULL. BUT OUR

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:24.704
AUDIT DIDN'T GET INTO A MORE

01:52:24.771 --> 01:52:26.106
GRANULAR ANALYSIS OF WHAT

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:28.641
PERCENTAGE WAS A RESULT OF

01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:29.375
BANKRUPTCIES VERSUS OTHER,

01:52:29.442 --> 01:52:31.244
OTHER FACTORS. WE CONSIDER THAT

01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:33.179
TO BE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:36.116
AUDIT. AND WHEN THERE'S

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:37.484
NEGOTIATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS

01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:38.485
THAT DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE

01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:41.254
AMOUNT OF THE FINES, THAT IS A

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:42.889
NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE AGENCY

01:52:42.956 --> 01:52:45.291
AND THE EMPLOYER. YES. IS THE

01:52:45.358 --> 01:52:47.293
VOICE OF THE WORKER AND THE

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:48.261
WORKERS IMPACTED. DO THEY HAVE

01:52:48.328 --> 01:52:50.597
A SAY IN THIS REDUCTION OF

01:52:50.663 --> 01:52:53.099
FINES OR FEES? YEAH. THANK YOU.

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:55.268
I BELIEVE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:56.736
ATTEND SOME OF THOSE

01:52:56.803 --> 01:52:57.537
CONFERENCES WHERE THEY DISCUSS

01:52:57.604 --> 01:52:58.338
THE REDUCTIONS. I'M NOT

01:52:58.404 --> 01:52:59.439
ENTIRELY SURE, BUT WE CAN

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:01.141
FIGURE THAT OUT AND LET YOU

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:03.510
KNOW. SO THEY MAY BE ABLE TO

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:04.310
ATTEND WHATEVER PORTION OF THE

01:53:04.377 --> 01:53:06.112
PUBLIC PROCESS IF THERE'S A

01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:07.213
HEARING, WHAT HAVE YOU, BUT NOT,

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.382
I'M PRESUMING, NOT PART OF ANY

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:10.950
NEGOTIATION THAT WOULD AGREE TO

01:53:11.017 --> 01:53:14.687
A REDUCTION IN THE ACTUAL

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:15.455
SETTLEMENT. CORRECT, TO MY

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:21.294
UNDERSTANDING. AND THE I'LL

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:22.428
JUST I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. I

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:24.197
THINK THAT WE'LL DO MORE FOLLOW

01:53:24.264 --> 01:53:26.132
UP WITH THE OTHER WITNESSES.

01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:27.500
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:30.203
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANSOM. YES,

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:32.572
THANK YOU, CHAIR, AND THANK YOU

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:34.741
TO ALL OF THE CHAIRS AND

01:53:34.807 --> 01:53:36.776
ESPECIALLY TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:39.245
ORTEGA FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS

01:53:39.312 --> 01:53:41.381
VERY IMPORTANT AREA. AND I

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:42.682
THINK WE'RE ALL KIND OF, YOU

01:53:42.749 --> 01:53:45.952
KNOW, BAFFLED ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:53:46.019 --> 01:53:48.121
GAPS, SUCH AS INFORMATION

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:50.790
SYSTEMS AND BEING ABLE TO FIND

01:53:50.857 --> 01:53:52.192
AND TRACK THINGS. BUT MY

01:53:52.258 --> 01:53:54.527
QUESTION IS, IS MY I'M GOING TO

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:56.663
START WITH TRYING TO CLARIFY

01:53:56.729 --> 01:53:59.766
WHEN FINES AND THINGS ARE BEING

01:53:59.832 --> 01:54:01.401
REDUCED. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE.

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.203
OR CAN YOU CONFIRM WERE YOU

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:05.838
ABLE TO SEE ANY SORT OF, YOU

01:54:05.905 --> 01:54:09.309
KNOW, IF THIS, THAT ANY SORT OF

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:10.577
CONSISTENCY OR WAS IT PRETTY

01:54:10.643 --> 01:54:13.680
MUCH BASED ON RELATIONSHIPS

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:14.380
BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE

01:54:14.447 --> 01:54:16.216
EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER AND

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:17.383
CONVERSATIONS LIKE, ARE THERE

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:20.119
ANY SYSTEMS EXISTING THAT WOULD

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:22.655
AT LEAST GIVE THEM LIKE A

01:54:22.722 --> 01:54:25.525
FORMULA FOR WHEN IT'S

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:29.128
APPROPRIATE TO REDUCE FINES?

01:54:29.195 --> 01:54:30.463
YEAH, I THANK YOU FOR THE

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:32.398
QUESTION. SO THAT WAS ACTUALLY

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:34.167
ONE OF THE ISSUES WE KIND OF

01:54:34.234 --> 01:54:35.401
FOUND IN THE AUDIT WAS THAT

01:54:35.468 --> 01:54:36.469
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF

01:54:36.536 --> 01:54:38.605
INDICATION AND A LOT OF THE

01:54:38.671 --> 01:54:40.607
CASE FILES REALLY WHY THE

01:54:40.673 --> 01:54:41.808
REDUCTIONS WERE HAPPENING AND

01:54:41.874 --> 01:54:43.176
THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, I

01:54:43.243 --> 01:54:45.845
THINK, IN THAT AREA ARE ALSO IN

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:47.180
NEED OF SOME CLARITY. AND SO,

01:54:47.247 --> 01:54:49.282
FOR EXAMPLE, ONE THING WE SAW A

01:54:49.349 --> 01:54:50.717
LOT WAS IN THE CONFERENCES THEY

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:52.285
HAVE WHERE THEY DISCUSS WITH

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:54.287
THE THE AGENCY AND THE EMPLOYER

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:56.322
DISCUSS POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS.

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.591
WE WOULD SEE DOCUMENTATION OF

01:54:58.658 --> 01:55:00.193
WHAT THE REDUCTIONS WOULD BE,

01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:02.829
BUT NOT WHY THAT WAS ACTUALLY

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:04.163
HAPPENING. AND IN ANOTHER

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:05.298
EXAMPLE WE TALK ABOUT IN THE

01:55:05.365 --> 01:55:07.300
REPORT, THE EMPLOYER ASSERTED

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:08.635
THROUGH EMAILS. SO WE WERE ABLE

01:55:08.701 --> 01:55:11.638
TO SEE IT IN THE CASE FILE THAT

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:12.372
MULTIPLE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS

01:55:12.438 --> 01:55:14.007
COULD THREATEN ITS ABILITY TO

01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:15.742
WIN CONTRACTS. BUT THERE WAS NO

01:55:15.808 --> 01:55:16.676
KIND OF DOCUMENTATION FROM

01:55:16.743 --> 01:55:18.311
CAL-OSHA ABOUT, WELL, WAS THAT

01:55:18.378 --> 01:55:20.480
A LEGITIMATE CLAIM? IS THAT A

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:22.482
GOOD REASON TO REDUCE THE FINE?

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:25.752
OKAY. DID YOU FIND IN YOUR IN

01:55:25.818 --> 01:55:28.087
YOUR AUDIT THAT THE THE AGENCY

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:32.191
WAS ACTING MORE AS A KIND OF AN

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:35.528
ALLY TO THE BUSINESS? I GUESS

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:38.298
I'M ASKING YOU IF YOU HAD TO

01:55:38.364 --> 01:55:40.867
WEIGH THE WAY THEY OPERATE, DO

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:43.436
WE FIND THEM TO BE MORE OF AN

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:45.138
EMPLOYEE PROTECTION OR A

01:55:45.204 --> 01:55:48.074
BUSINESS FRIENDLY AGENCY? THANK

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:50.243
YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I, I

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:52.378
UNDERSTAND THE THE FRAME OF IT.

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:53.680
IN ALL HONESTY, IT'S DIFFICULT

01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:55.315
FOR ME TO ANSWER THAT. AS AN

01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:57.817
AUDITOR, I TRY TO BE AS

01:55:57.884 --> 01:55:58.451
INDEPENDENT AND OBJECTIVE AS I

01:55:58.518 --> 01:56:00.953
CAN. AND SO THE LACK OF A

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.055
RATIONALE, THE LACK OF

01:56:02.121 --> 01:56:04.257
EXPLANATIONS IN THE FILE ABOUT

01:56:04.324 --> 01:56:05.458
WHY THEY'RE MAKING THE

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:06.826
DECISIONS THEY'RE MAKING JUST

01:56:06.893 --> 01:56:08.628
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:10.563
SAY THAT THEY'RE PRO EMPLOYER

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:14.233
OR PRO EMPLOYEE. UNDERSTAND

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:16.469
THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:19.939
THEN WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:56:20.006 --> 01:56:24.377
OF THEIR CONSULTANT IN YOUR I

01:56:24.444 --> 01:56:27.680
KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T DO THE, I

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:29.549
GUESS THE THE SAME SORT OF

01:56:29.615 --> 01:56:31.651
IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:34.153
EMPLOYEES THEY NEEDED AS THE

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.356
CONSULTANT. BUT AND WE ALSO

01:56:36.422 --> 01:56:39.025
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A NEED

01:56:39.092 --> 01:56:40.460
FOR THE INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS,

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:43.596
BUT THAT'S A LOT OF EMPLOYEES.

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:47.867
AND SO IN YOUR ANALYSIS, IS IT

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:50.336
MORE. AND I HOPEFULLY YOU CAN

01:56:50.403 --> 01:56:51.471
ANSWER THIS QUESTION, IS IT IS

01:56:51.537 --> 01:56:53.239
IT THAT WE NEED THAT MANY MORE

01:56:53.306 --> 01:56:56.709
EMPLOYEES OR DO WE WOULD IT BE

01:56:56.776 --> 01:56:58.411
EQUALLY OR MORE BENEFICIAL TO

01:56:58.478 --> 01:57:00.346
FOLLOW THE POLICIES? BECAUSE

01:57:00.413 --> 01:57:02.148
WHAT I GOT FROM YOUR AUDIT IS

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:03.449
THERE ARE SOME POLICIES THAT

01:57:03.516 --> 01:57:07.553
JUST WEREN'T FOLLOWED. SO IT

01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:09.288
THE THE POLICIES WEREN'T

01:57:09.355 --> 01:57:10.556
FOLLOWED REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY

01:57:10.623 --> 01:57:12.191
EMPLOYEES YOU HAVE. SO I'M

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:14.460
WONDERING IF WE TRULY NEED THAT

01:57:14.527 --> 01:57:16.729
MANY EMPLOYEES OR IF YOU CAN,

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:19.065
YOU KNOW, KIND OF HONE IN ON

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:21.367
THAT. YEAH, I THINK TO ANSWER

01:57:21.434 --> 01:57:23.403
THAT QUESTION, IT GETS BACK TO

01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:24.270
THE COMMENT I MADE EARLIER

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:26.239
ABOUT THE THREE LEGGED STOOL TO

01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:28.107
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM HERE. IT'S

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:29.275
PARTLY A STAFFING ISSUE, PARTLY

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:31.444
A POLICY ISSUE WHERE PEOPLE

01:57:31.511 --> 01:57:33.146
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S EXPECTED OF

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:34.380
THEM. AND THEN IT'S A

01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:36.482
MONITORING ISSUE WHERE CAL OSHA

01:57:36.549 --> 01:57:37.583
CURRENTLY ISN'T IN THE

01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:39.318
STRONGEST OF POSITIONS TO KNOW

01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:41.120
WHETHER OR NOT ITS EMPLOYEES

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:43.456
ARE FOLLOWING POLICIES THAT ARE

01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:45.658
HOPEFULLY UNDERSTOOD AND UP TO

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:49.328
DATE. AND THE THE WORKLOAD

01:57:49.395 --> 01:57:51.431
ANALYSIS THAT CAL OSHA IS

01:57:51.497 --> 01:57:54.367
CONSULTANT DID, I WILL SAY,

01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:56.869
FOCUSED HEAVILY ON HIRING MORE

01:57:56.936 --> 01:57:58.371
INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS. I DON'T

01:57:58.438 --> 01:58:01.174
HAVE THE EXACT FIGURE IN MY

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:04.010
MIND, BUT I THINK CAL OSHA HAD

01:58:04.076 --> 01:58:05.111
SOMETHING AROUND EIGHT, AND THE

01:58:05.178 --> 01:58:06.512
CONSULTANT WAS RECOMMENDING

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:09.148
THAT THEY HAVE OVER 200 MORE.

01:58:09.215 --> 01:58:11.851
AND SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:13.386
NEW HIRES THAT THE CONSULTANT

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:14.187
WAS RECOMMENDING WAS IN THE

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:16.255
INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST

01:58:16.322 --> 01:58:17.457
CLASSIFICATION. THANK YOU. AND

01:58:17.523 --> 01:58:19.225
THEN FOR MY FINAL QUESTION, I

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:21.360
BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:22.695
CONCERNS OR RATIONALES THEY

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:24.330
GAVE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO FILL

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:27.767
THE POSITIONS IS LACK OF

01:58:27.834 --> 01:58:30.636
QUALIFIED FOLKS, YOU KNOW, FOR

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:33.439
THAT POSITION. AND I'M

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:36.075
WONDERING IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:38.277
WHETHER THAT, IN YOUR OPINION,

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:39.479
IS IS CLEARLY AN OPINION

01:58:39.545 --> 01:58:41.113
QUESTION. IF THAT'S OVERSTATED,

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:43.983
IS THIS NOT A POSITION THAT YOU

01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:46.185
COULD REALLY PUT EMPHASIS ON,

01:58:46.252 --> 01:58:48.287
YOU KNOW, TRAINING OR HAVING AN

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:49.422
INTERNAL CERTIFICATION PROGRAM?

01:58:49.489 --> 01:58:51.324
WHAT WHY ARE, IN YOUR OPINION,

01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:53.493
IS IT SO HARD TO FIND A

01:58:53.559 --> 01:58:56.395
QUALIFIED PERSON TO, YOU KNOW,

01:58:56.462 --> 01:58:59.499
FOLLOW UP ON SOME STANDARDS

01:58:59.565 --> 01:59:01.434
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT? YEAH, I

01:59:01.501 --> 01:59:02.568
THINK THANK YOU FOR THE

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:03.436
QUESTION. SO THIS ISN'T

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:05.505
SOMETHING THAT WE LOOKED INTO

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:06.873
VERY DEEPLY, BUT WE DID HAVE

01:59:06.939 --> 01:59:08.107
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AGENCY.

01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:10.343
AND ONE THING THAT WE HEARD IN

01:59:10.409 --> 01:59:11.644
THIS AREA IS THAT ESPECIALLY

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:13.212
FOR THE INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS,

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:15.448
IT'S JUST HARD IN THE PIPELINE

01:59:15.515 --> 01:59:17.884
TO BRING IN ENOUGH FOLKS WITH

01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:20.353
THOSE QUALIFICATIONS. AND WHEN

01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:22.154
WE TALK TO CAL OSHA AND DIU

01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:24.957
ABOUT THIS, I THINK THEY

01:59:25.024 --> 01:59:26.192
RECOGNIZE THIS. AND MAYBE WERE

01:59:26.259 --> 01:59:28.227
TELLING US THAT THE

01:59:28.294 --> 01:59:29.862
QUALIFICATIONS MAY NOT, IN

01:59:29.929 --> 01:59:31.564
EVERY CASE, BE NECESSARY. SO

01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:33.799
THINKING ABOUT CHANGES THAT

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:34.634
COULD HELP IMPROVE THE PIPELINE

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.736
THERE. OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:59:36.802 --> 01:59:39.272
APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. THANK YOU

01:59:39.338 --> 01:59:42.341
FOR THAT. I WOULD ASK MR. PARKS,

01:59:42.408 --> 01:59:43.643
MR. VERSACE TO REMAIN THERE.

01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:45.244
I'M GOING TO BRING UP THE

01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:46.612
DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR RESPONSE

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:48.114
AND COMMENTS. AND JOINING US

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:50.616
HERE IS DIRECTOR JENNIFER

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.752

02:00:04.463 --> 02:00:07.333
WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. AND IF

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.335
YOU COULD KEEP IT TO TEN

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:10.536
MINUTES, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

02:00:10.603 --> 02:00:12.071
BUT WE WILL OBVIOUSLY NOT CUT

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:13.472

02:00:13.539 --> 02:00:16.108

THIS TEAM. I'M NOW IN MY THIRD

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:52.478
WEEK AT THE DEPARTMENT, AND I

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:53.446

02:00:58.684 --> 02:01:00.486

DEPARTMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A

02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:04.390
NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:06.659
OUTCOMES, INCLUDING MANY THAT

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:07.426
HAVE LED TO REDUCTION IN

VACANCY RATES ACROSS THE

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:11.931

02:01:11.998 --> 02:01:12.565
POINTS OUT, THERE'S STILL MORE

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:14.634
TO DO. I'VE WORKED FOR OVER 27

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.868

02:02:42.354 --> 02:02:45.591
TO THANK THE STATE AUDITORS AND

02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:59.271
CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAT

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:00.506
IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED AT

02:03:00.573 --> 02:03:03.342
CAL-OSHA. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:21.193
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE VARIOUS

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:23.863
STRATEGIES IN PLACE TO OVERCOME

02:03:23.929 --> 02:03:26.632
THE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. I

02:03:26.699 --> 02:03:29.101
BECAME CHIEF OF CAL OSHA IN

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:33.005
JUNE OF 2024, BUT MY CAREER

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:34.673
WITH CAL OSHA STARTED THREE

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:38.944
DECADES AGO, BACK IN 1994, WHEN

02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:41.447
I JOINED AS AN INDUSTRIAL

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:43.482
HYGIENIST IN THE ENFORCEMENT

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:45.518
BRANCH. SINCE THEN, I HAVE

02:03:45.584 --> 02:03:47.620
MOVED UP THE RANKS. MOST

02:03:47.686 --> 02:03:49.789
RECENTLY, I WAS THE DEPUTY

02:03:49.855 --> 02:03:51.423
CHIEF OF ENFORCEMENT, AND I AM

02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:54.727
NOW HONORED TO SERVE IN THIS

02:03:54.794 --> 02:03:55.494
ADMINISTRATION AS CHIEF OF CAL

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:57.763
OSHA. THROUGH MY YEARS OF

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.532
SERVICE, I HAVE SEEN HOW CAL

02:03:59.598 --> 02:04:03.435
OSHA HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME AND

02:04:03.502 --> 02:04:06.272
HOW IT WAS STRETCHED DURING THE

02:04:06.338 --> 02:04:09.008
COVID 19 PANDEMIC TO MEET THE

02:04:09.074 --> 02:04:11.243
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND

02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:14.113
EMPLOYERS. I HAVE MANY IDEAS TO

02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:16.816
MAKE WITH CAL OSHA TO MAKE CAL

02:04:16.882 --> 02:04:18.050
OSHA MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:20.319
EFFICIENT. MY PRIORITY IS TO

02:04:20.386 --> 02:04:23.189
PROVE AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF

02:04:23.255 --> 02:04:27.726
CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND EMPOWER

02:04:27.793 --> 02:04:29.528
EMPLOYERS. EXCUSE ME TO PROVIDE

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:32.264
A SAFE WORKPLACE. IN FACT,

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:34.433
UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, CAL OSHA

02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:37.536
WAS ALREADY WORKING TO FIX

FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE

02:05:37.363 --> 02:05:39.231

THE REDUCTION IN THE VACANCY

02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:53.812

02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:56.382

SECONDLY, THE REDUCTION OR

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:15.267
VACANCY RATE IS DUE TO THE CAL

02:06:15.334 --> 02:06:17.503

JUST GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.508

02:13:06.211 --> 02:13:07.412
POSITIONS AND WHERE YOU ARE

02:13:07.479 --> 02:13:10.515
WITH REGARD TO THE NUMBER OF

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:12.317
POSITIONS, AND MAYBE GET A

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:14.653
COMMENT FROM YOU ON HOW HARD IT

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:18.523
IS TO RECRUIT AND WHAT MIGHT BE

02:13:18.590 --> 02:13:21.293
OF ASSISTANCE IN BEING ABLE TO

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.829
SUCCESSFULLY FILL VACANCIES.

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:26.832
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

02:13:26.898 --> 02:13:29.267
SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY

02:13:29.334 --> 02:13:31.770
DILIGENTLY WITH OUR VACANCY

02:13:31.837 --> 02:13:34.539
RATES. AS I STATED IN MY

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:36.808

02:13:36.875 --> 02:13:38.877
RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT UNIT

02:13:38.944 --> 02:13:41.146
WITHIN THE ENFORCEMENT BRANCH.

02:13:41.213 --> 02:13:44.116
WE KICKED THAT OFF, I BELIEVE

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:46.251
IN 2024. TOWARDS THE END WHEN

02:13:46.318 --> 02:13:49.354
WE BUILT THE UNIT, THAT TEAM

02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:51.590
HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVELY GOING OUT.

02:13:51.656 --> 02:13:54.092
AS I STATED, TO SCHOOLS, TO

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:57.329
UNIVERSITIES AND JOB FAIRS AND

02:13:57.396 --> 02:13:59.798
SHARING AND IDENTIFYING OUR

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:01.633
VACANCIES TO RESPOND. OUR

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:02.567
CURRENT VACANCY, AS I STATED,

02:14:02.634 --> 02:14:05.370

VACANCY RATE. AND AND MR.

02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:14.246
COLADA, IF YOU CAN JUST SORT OF

02:14:14.312 --> 02:14:16.314
WORK INTO THAT. THE NET EFFECT

02:14:16.381 --> 02:14:18.817
OF THE SWEEP OF POSITIONS GOING

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:21.920
FROM A VACANCY RATE OF 32% TO

02:14:21.987 --> 02:14:24.756
12%, HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS A

02:14:24.823 --> 02:14:26.158
SWEEP OF POSITIONS AND AND HOW

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:29.961
MUCH OF THAT IS FILLING VACANT

02:14:30.028 --> 02:14:33.698
POSITIONS? THANK YOU AGAIN. MY

02:14:33.765 --> 02:14:36.201
NAME IS ANDREW. I'M THE CHIEF

02:14:36.268 --> 02:14:37.469
OF ADMINISTRATION HERE AT DIR.

02:14:37.536 --> 02:14:39.171
AND IN MY POSITION I OVERSEE

02:14:39.237 --> 02:14:41.706
THE PERSONNEL OFFICE, HUMAN

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:44.109
RESOURCES OFFICE WITHIN DIR.

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:46.378
JUST PIGGYBACKING OFF OF WHAT

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:49.147
CHIEF LEE SAID, ONE OF OUR

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:53.518
ISSUES WITH RECRUITMENT AND

02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:57.823
HIRING WITHIN IS THE

02:14:57.889 --> 02:14:59.257
SPECIFICATION. THE CLASS

02:14:59.324 --> 02:15:00.492
SPECIFICATION SERVES AS THE

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:02.894
BASIS FOR DUTY STATEMENTS AND

02:15:02.961 --> 02:15:04.229
ESTABLISHES MINIMUM

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:06.298
QUALIFICATIONS FOR APPOINTMENT

02:15:06.364 --> 02:15:08.400
TO POSITIONS WITHIN THE

02:15:08.467 --> 02:15:11.102
DEPARTMENT OF. THAT

02:15:11.169 --> 02:15:13.238
CLASSIFICATION IS SEVERAL

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:14.606
DECADES OLD. IT HASN'T BEEN

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:17.409
UPDATED. WE THINK THAT THAT MAY

02:15:17.476 --> 02:15:19.044
BE A FACTOR IN RECRUITING

02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:20.679
WITHIN THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION

02:15:20.745 --> 02:15:23.482
WITHIN. SPECIFICALLY, WE THINK

02:15:23.548 --> 02:15:27.786
THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS MAY

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:31.156
ARTIFICIALLY AFFECT APPOINTMENT

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:32.524
OF PEOPLE INTO THE

02:15:32.591 --> 02:15:34.893
CLASSIFICATION DUE TO THE

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.394
EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE

02:15:36.461 --> 02:15:38.430
REQUIREMENTS. TO ADDRESS THAT

02:15:38.497 --> 02:15:40.732
ISSUE, WE HAVE ACTUALLY ENTERED

02:15:40.799 --> 02:15:42.667
INTO A CONTRACT WITH A

02:15:42.734 --> 02:15:45.303
CONSULTANT TO DO A

02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:46.471
SPECIFICATION CLASS STUDY.

02:15:46.538 --> 02:15:48.874
COULD YOU TELL ME HOW THAT FITS

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:52.177
INTO THE OVERALL THING? IS IT

02:15:52.244 --> 02:15:54.946
THAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE

02:15:55.013 --> 02:15:55.514
VACANCIES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.582
UPDATED OR YOU'RE HIRING PEOPLE

02:15:57.649 --> 02:16:01.219
TO THAT WITH A NOT UPDATED

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:04.289
THING? I'M STILL SORT OF STUCK

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:06.124
ON WHAT THE RATE IS AND WHAT

02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:08.260
LOWERED IT AND WHAT YOUR YOUR

02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:09.661
OBSTACLES ARE OR AREN'T, AND

02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:11.696
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT FITS IN.

02:16:11.763 --> 02:16:13.398
SO ONE OF THE OBSTACLES IS THE

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:14.332
CLASSIFICATION SPECIFICATION.

02:16:14.399 --> 02:16:16.268
IT'S IT WE THINK IT MAY BE

02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:17.602
LIMITING THE CANDIDATE POOL WHO

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:19.337
COULD BE APPOINTED TO THE

02:16:19.404 --> 02:16:21.239
POSITION. I THINK JUST TO

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:23.441
PIGGYBACK OFF OF SOME OF THE

02:16:23.508 --> 02:16:25.577
COMMENTS THE CHIEF LEE MADE, WE

02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:27.312
ARE ACTUALLY MADE SOME

02:16:27.379 --> 02:16:30.215
STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO OUR

02:16:30.282 --> 02:16:31.483
HIRING PROCESSES. WE ACTUALLY

02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:34.819
HAVE A A MORE ROBUST OUTREACH

02:16:34.886 --> 02:16:37.822
EFFORT TO COMMUNITIES. WE'VE

02:16:37.889 --> 02:16:39.224
DEVELOPED PARTNERSHIPS WITH

02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:42.060
COLLEGES AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:45.330
GROUPS. WE HAVE A MORE ROBUST

02:16:45.397 --> 02:16:47.165
PRESENCE ON AN ONLINE MEDIA,

02:16:47.232 --> 02:16:49.434
PARTICULARLY LINKEDIN. WE ALSO

02:16:49.501 --> 02:16:51.169
OFFER TRAINING TO CANDIDATES ON

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:53.572
HOW TO FILL A STATE APPLICATION

02:16:53.638 --> 02:16:55.807
AND TO DO STATEMENT OF

02:16:55.874 --> 02:16:56.341
QUALIFICATIONS, WHICH ARE

02:16:56.408 --> 02:16:58.710
NECESSARY TO GET INTERVIEWS. WE

02:16:58.777 --> 02:17:02.180
ALSO AND SO ARE YOU BASICALLY

02:17:02.247 --> 02:17:03.415
STATING THAT DOING ALL THIS

02:17:03.481 --> 02:17:04.716
WORK IS THE REASON YOU'VE BEEN

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:06.518
ABLE TO FILL SOME OF THE

02:17:06.585 --> 02:17:07.586
POSITIONS? OH, ABSOLUTELY. AND

02:17:07.652 --> 02:17:10.221
THEN YOU SAID THAT THERE'S AN

02:17:10.288 --> 02:17:12.290
ISSUE OF GETTING THE

02:17:12.357 --> 02:17:14.492
CLASSIFICATION UPDATED.

02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:16.261
UNFORTUNATELY, AS A FORMER

02:17:16.328 --> 02:17:17.829
STATE ADMINISTRATOR, I HAVE

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:19.264
LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH HUMAN

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:21.766
RESOURCES AND THEY ARE NOT

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:23.435
LIGHTNING FAST IN THOSE

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:26.671
PROCESSES. AND HOW LONG WILL IT

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:28.173
TAKE YOU TO DO THAT AND AND

02:17:28.239 --> 02:17:30.375
REALLY TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:31.242
SO THERE ARE SEVERAL STEPS IN

02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:33.211
THE PROCESS. WE ENGAGED WITH

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:34.446
THE CONSULTANT ABOUT TWO MONTHS

02:17:34.512 --> 02:17:36.181
AGO. THEY ARE IN THE DATA

02:17:36.247 --> 02:17:38.316
COLLECTION PHASE OF THE STUDY.

02:17:38.383 --> 02:17:41.353
WE EXPECT TO HAVE A REPORT AND

02:17:41.419 --> 02:17:44.689
A REVISED DRAFT SPECIFICATION

02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:46.291
TO US AT THE START OF THE YEAR.

02:17:46.358 --> 02:17:48.727
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CAL

02:17:48.793 --> 02:17:52.263
H.R TO DEVELOP A PACKAGE FOR

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:55.266
PRESENTATION TO SPB, AND WE

02:17:55.333 --> 02:17:57.335
ALSO WILL BE CONSULTING WITH. I

02:17:57.402 --> 02:17:58.637
WANT TO GIVE MY COLLEAGUES A

02:17:58.703 --> 02:18:00.505
CHANCE TO ASK A QUESTION, BUT

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:01.506
I'M DETERMINED TO DRILL DOWN ON

02:18:01.573 --> 02:18:04.275
THIS. SO YOU'RE TAKING TWO

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:05.477
MONTHS AND THEN FOUR MORE

02:18:05.543 --> 02:18:07.512
MONTHS TO GET A REPORT. THEN

02:18:07.579 --> 02:18:10.348
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO

02:18:10.415 --> 02:18:11.549
ACCOMPLISH A CHANGE THAT

02:18:11.616 --> 02:18:13.218
MATCHES WHAT A RECOMMENDATION

02:18:13.284 --> 02:18:15.253
IS IN THE REPORT? SO WE'RE

02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:17.222
HOPING IT WILL BE IN THE FIRST

02:18:17.288 --> 02:18:19.324
QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR. OKAY.

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:20.592
THANK YOU. I'VE PROBABLY GIVEN

02:18:20.659 --> 02:18:22.260
ENOUGH FODDER HERE THAT SOME

02:18:22.327 --> 02:18:23.495
PEOPLE WILL ASK FOLLOW UP

02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:25.463
QUESTIONS. I APOLOGIZE THAT I

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:27.332
HAVE TO LEAVE. THANK YOU, MR.

02:18:27.399 --> 02:18:28.533
VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR BEING

02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:30.702

I APPRECIATE THE WORK. AND, YOU

02:18:42.514 --> 02:18:45.216

02:18:45.283 --> 02:18:47.052
ACKNOWLEDGING THE STAFF YOU DO

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:49.454
HAVE AND THE WORK THAT THEY ARE

02:18:49.521 --> 02:18:52.357
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. HOWEVER,

02:18:52.424 --> 02:18:54.259
YOU KNOW, WITH THIS AUDIT

02:18:54.325 --> 02:18:57.629
COMING OUT, CONFIRMING A LOT OF

02:18:57.696 --> 02:18:59.831
THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD DURING

02:18:59.898 --> 02:19:01.166
THE LAST HEARING WHERE WE FIRST

02:19:01.232 --> 02:19:06.438
MET, AND I HAD FARMWORKERS TELL

02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:08.373
STORY AFTER STORY ABOUT HOW CAL

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:10.475
OSHA WAS FAILING THEM. SO I

02:19:10.542 --> 02:19:13.812
WANT TO START WITH A BASIC

02:19:13.878 --> 02:19:17.282
QUESTION, WHICH I THINK ONE OF

02:19:17.348 --> 02:19:19.217
MY COLLEAGUES WAS ALLUDING TO

02:19:19.284 --> 02:19:22.954

COMMENT ON THAT FURTHER

02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:01.259
CORRECTLY. OUR MISSION, OUR

THAT INCLUDES EMPLOYERS AND

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:07.999
THAT INCLUDES WORKERS. THAT

02:20:08.066 --> 02:20:10.502
INCLUDES, AS I SAID, THE PEOPLE

02:20:10.568 --> 02:20:12.437

OUR ESTABLISHMENT IS TO EDUCATE

02:20:15.273 --> 02:20:16.775

OPENING, TO EMPOWER THEM TO

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:20.378

02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:43.535
REGULATIONS. WE ARE HERE FOR

02:20:43.601 --> 02:20:46.237
THE WORKERS AND WE ARE HERE FOR

02:20:46.304 --> 02:20:47.639
THE EMPLOYERS, AND WE ARE HERE

02:20:47.705 --> 02:20:48.907
TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR WORKERS AND

02:20:48.973 --> 02:20:51.242
EMPLOYERS. OKAY. WELL, LET ME

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:55.513
READ. THE THERE'S A SUMMARY IN

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:57.782
HERE THAT SAYS DIR IS TASKED

02:20:57.849 --> 02:20:59.717
WITH PROTECTING AND IMPROVING

02:20:59.784 --> 02:21:01.686
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF

02:21:01.753 --> 02:21:04.155
CALIFORNIA'S NEARLY 20 MILLION

02:21:04.222 --> 02:21:07.025
WORKERS BY ENFORCING THE

02:21:07.091 --> 02:21:09.227
WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS STATE LAW

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:12.864
REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE.

02:21:12.931 --> 02:21:15.400
AND I THINK WHAT YOU JUST

02:21:15.466 --> 02:21:17.569
OUTLINED, THIS LEVEL, LEVEL

02:21:17.635 --> 02:21:19.437
PLAYING FIELD HERE, I, I DON'T

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:24.309
SEE THAT HERE. I THOUGHT YOUR

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:27.145
ROLE RESPONSIBILITY WAS TO

02:21:27.212 --> 02:21:29.447
ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF

02:21:29.514 --> 02:21:32.283
WORKERS. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE

02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:33.952
THING THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY

02:21:34.018 --> 02:21:35.220
TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAT REALLY

02:21:35.286 --> 02:21:37.322
STOOD OUT TO ME IN THIS AUDIT

02:21:37.388 --> 02:21:40.325
IS THE FACT THAT FOR QUITE A

02:21:40.391 --> 02:21:42.560
BIT OF TIME, WE'VE REALLY

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:45.597
FOCUSED ON THE STAFFING ISSUE

02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:47.832
AND WHAT I REALLY HOPE MY

02:21:47.899 --> 02:21:49.133
COLLEAGUES AND THE PUBLIC

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:52.403
UNDERSTAND IS THE SEVERITY OF

02:21:52.470 --> 02:21:54.539
CAL-OSHA FAILURE TO PROTECT

02:21:54.606 --> 02:21:56.941
WORKERS, AND THAT THIS ISSUE

02:21:57.008 --> 02:22:00.378
GOES FAR BEYOND STAFFING.

02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:02.580
EMPLOYERS WHO PUT WORKERS IN

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:04.415
DANGER ARE NOT BEING HELD

02:22:04.482 --> 02:22:08.319
ACCOUNTABLE. I STARTED THIS

02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:11.122
HEARING WITH AN EXAMPLE IN MY

02:22:11.189 --> 02:22:14.692
DISTRICT, WHERE I HAVE THREE

02:22:14.759 --> 02:22:17.362
WORKERS, THREE WHO HAVE DIED IN

02:22:17.428 --> 02:22:20.131
THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WITHOUT

02:22:20.198 --> 02:22:22.467
ANY CRIMINAL CRIMINAL

02:22:22.533 --> 02:22:27.272
PROSECUTION OF ANY KIND. YOU,

02:22:27.338 --> 02:22:29.007
IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT THAT

02:22:29.073 --> 02:22:32.343
I HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE DATA

02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:34.646
MODERNIZATION PROJECT, AS IF

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:37.749
IT'S GOING TO SOLVE EVERY ISSUE.

02:22:37.815 --> 02:22:39.684
BUT THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE NO

02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:41.986
IMPACT ON SOME OF THE BIGGEST,

02:22:42.053 --> 02:22:43.288
MOST CONCERNING THINGS THAT I

02:22:43.354 --> 02:22:45.523
FOUND IN THIS AUDIT. SO I WANT

02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:47.392
TO START WITH SOME OTHER

02:22:47.458 --> 02:22:49.894
QUESTIONS. LET'S TALK ABOUT

02:22:49.961 --> 02:22:52.163
THESE LETTERS. WHAT IS THE

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:55.733
PROCESS OF THESE LETTERS. AND

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:58.803
THE AUDIT SAID HE HE COULDN'T

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:00.471
FIND RATIONALE. YOU'RE USING

02:23:00.538 --> 02:23:02.407
THEM 80% OF THE TIME. YOU'RE

02:23:02.473 --> 02:23:05.276
ASKING EMPLOYERS TO, YOU KNOW,

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:07.645
REPORT ON THEMSELVES TO

02:23:07.712 --> 02:23:10.181
SELF-POLICE THEMSELVES. SO WHAT

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.482
IS HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHO

02:23:11.549 --> 02:23:14.152
GETS A LETTER? HOW DO YOU

02:23:14.218 --> 02:23:16.254
DETERMINE WHAT THE FINES ARE?

02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:18.089
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE EMPLOYER

02:23:18.156 --> 02:23:20.758
GETS ONE, 2 OR 3 LETTERS AND

02:23:20.825 --> 02:23:23.261
THEY DO NOTHING? THANK YOU FOR

02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:26.164
THE QUESTION. AND I THINK,

02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:30.101
DAVID, YOU'RE GOING TO. YEAH.

02:23:30.168 --> 02:23:32.270
THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I'M DAVID

02:23:32.337 --> 02:23:34.372
WESLEY I'M THE DEPUTY CHIEF FOR

02:23:34.439 --> 02:23:38.343
CAL OSHA ENFORCEMENT. LET ME

02:23:38.409 --> 02:23:40.545
JUST START BY SAYING THE THE

02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:42.213
LETTER PROCESS IS SOMETHING

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:44.449
THAT IS USED BY US. IT'S ALSO

02:23:44.515 --> 02:23:47.852
USED BY OSHA AND OTHER STATES.

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:49.053
IT'S A WAY FOR US TO LEVERAGE

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:57.295
OUR RESOURCES TO. TO GET

02:23:57.362 --> 02:23:59.130
EMPLOYERS TO ACTUALLY RESPOND

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:01.366
WHEN WE CAN'T GO OUT ON SITE

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:03.568
INSPECTION, WHEN WE RECEIVE

02:24:03.634 --> 02:24:06.371
COMPLAINTS AND WE RECEIVE OVER

02:24:06.437 --> 02:24:08.206
12,000 COMPLAINTS A YEAR, WE

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:11.809
HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:12.910
HAZARD LEVEL IS ON THOSE

02:24:12.977 --> 02:24:15.313
COMPLAINTS. IF IT'S THERE'S

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:21.085
BASICALLY THREE LEVELS WE HAVE.

02:24:21.152 --> 02:24:24.722
WHERE THEY'RE IMMINENT, WHERE,

02:24:24.789 --> 02:24:26.057
YOU KNOW, CLEARLY THERE'S

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:29.494
THERE'S A WORKER WHO IS IN A

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.330
POSITION OF POSSIBLE DEATH OR

02:24:32.397 --> 02:24:35.566
SERIOUS INJURY UNLESS A CHANGE

02:24:35.633 --> 02:24:37.301
IS MADE IMMEDIATELY. WE USE AS

02:24:37.368 --> 02:24:38.136
EXAMPLES, FOR INSTANCE, AN

02:24:38.202 --> 02:24:40.571
UNSURE TRENCH. YOU KNOW, IF WE

02:24:40.638 --> 02:24:41.506
HAVE A WORKER IN AN UNSURE

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:43.474
TRENCH, WE SEND SOMEBODY OUT

02:24:43.541 --> 02:24:44.275
IMMEDIATELY TO TO GET THE

02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:46.577
WORKERS OUT OF THE TRENCH AND

02:24:46.644 --> 02:24:49.414
STOP THE WORK UNTIL IT GETS

02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:53.184
FIXED. SO. THAT'S THE FIRST

02:24:53.251 --> 02:24:55.987
LEVEL. THE NEXT LEVEL IS IF

02:24:56.054 --> 02:25:00.458
IT'S A SERIOUS. VIOLATION, FOR

02:25:00.525 --> 02:25:02.226
INSTANCE, THERE COULD BE LIKE A

02:25:02.293 --> 02:25:06.097
MACHINE THAT'S NOT GUARDED. WE

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:08.232
CAN WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:09.534
AND SAY, YOU KNOW, IT MAY NOT

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:11.536
BE IMMINENT. THERE MAY NOT BE

02:25:11.602 --> 02:25:12.303
ANYBODY WORKING AROUND IT AT

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:14.672
THE MOMENT, BUT IT'S A IT'S A

02:25:14.739 --> 02:25:18.676
SERIOUS LEVEL. SO WE ARE WE ARE

02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:20.545
REVISING OUR POLICIES AND

02:25:20.611 --> 02:25:21.412
PROCEDURES TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:25:21.479 --> 02:25:25.349
ALL SERIOUS. COMPLAINTS WILL

02:25:25.416 --> 02:25:27.919
RESULT IN AN ON SITE INSPECTION.

02:25:27.985 --> 02:25:30.254
THAT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE IN

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:31.689
TERMS OF OUR POLICY AND

02:25:31.756 --> 02:25:32.390
PROCEDURES. WE'RE MAKING SURE

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:34.158
THAT THAT GETS CLARIFIED AND

02:25:34.225 --> 02:25:36.794
UPDATED. THEN THE NEXT LEVEL

02:25:36.861 --> 02:25:38.629
WOULD BE OTHER THAN SERIOUS

02:25:38.696 --> 02:25:40.765
TYPES OF COMPLAINTS AND THOSE

02:25:40.832 --> 02:25:42.366
WE WE GET A LITTLE MORE

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:44.268
GRANULAR. WE ACTUALLY USE SOME

02:25:44.335 --> 02:25:45.403
OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE

02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:47.038
LABOR CODE. WE ALSO HAVE

02:25:47.105 --> 02:25:48.406
DIRECTIVES FROM OSHA THAT WE

02:25:48.473 --> 02:25:50.541
HAVE TO KIND OF TAKE A LOOK AT

02:25:50.608 --> 02:25:54.979
AND ADHERE TO. BUT FOR THOSE

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:56.280
TYPES OF COMPLAINTS, AND SOME

02:25:56.347 --> 02:25:59.383
OF THEM CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS A

02:25:59.450 --> 02:26:01.219
RECORD KEEPING TYPE OF A

02:26:01.285 --> 02:26:03.521
COMPLAINT. BUT FOR THOSE TYPES

02:26:03.588 --> 02:26:05.590
OF COMPLAINTS, THEN WE LOOK AT

02:26:05.656 --> 02:26:09.093
WHETHER IT IS A AN EMPLOYEE OR

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:11.529
AN EMPLOYEES REPRESENTATIVE

02:26:11.596 --> 02:26:13.197
THAT HAS MADE THE COMPLAINT. IF

02:26:13.264 --> 02:26:16.968
THAT'S THE CASE, THEN WE WILL

02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:19.170
DO AN ON SITE INSPECTION. WE

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:20.538
DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT THERE AS

02:26:20.605 --> 02:26:23.107
QUICKLY AS WE DO FOR THE

02:26:23.174 --> 02:26:24.408
SERIOUS ONES, BUT WE DO AN ON

02:26:24.475 --> 02:26:26.344
SITE INSPECTION FOR THE OTHER

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:28.312
ONES. WE WILL NOW DEFER TO THE

02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:32.150
TO THE LETTER INVESTIGATION. SO

02:26:32.216 --> 02:26:35.553
WE ARE TAKING THE THE AUDIT

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:38.956
FINDINGS VERY SERIOUSLY. WE

02:26:39.023 --> 02:26:41.125
CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THE

02:26:41.192 --> 02:26:43.261
WORKERS IN THE STATE OF

02:26:43.327 --> 02:26:45.429
CALIFORNIA DESERVE TO HAVE THE

02:26:45.496 --> 02:26:47.965
BEST COVERAGE THEY CAN GET. SO

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:55.206
WE ARE. LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF

02:26:55.273 --> 02:26:56.440
LETTER INVESTIGATIONS, NOT THE

02:26:56.507 --> 02:26:58.442
AMOUNT, BUT THE THE STATUS OF

02:26:58.509 --> 02:26:59.177
THE LETTER INVESTIGATIONS TO

02:26:59.243 --> 02:27:01.279
MAKE SURE THAT THE SERIOUS

02:27:01.345 --> 02:27:03.714
VIOLATIONS ARE ADDRESSED WITH

02:27:03.781 --> 02:27:08.152
ON SITE INSPECTIONS. WE ARE IN

02:27:08.219 --> 02:27:10.454
THE PROCESS OF OR HAVE UPDATED

02:27:10.521 --> 02:27:12.123
SOME OF OUR POLICIES AND

02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:13.357
PROCEDURES. WE WILL BE SOON

02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:15.826
TRAINING OUR MANAGERS ON THOSE

02:27:15.893 --> 02:27:17.261
PROCEDURES, AND THEN THERE WILL

02:27:17.328 --> 02:27:20.431
BE FOLLOW UP INTERNAL AUDITS

02:27:20.498 --> 02:27:24.969
FROM OUR OWN DIVISION TO

02:27:25.036 --> 02:27:28.973
ADDRESS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:39.817
THOSE OF THOSE CHANGES. SORRY.

02:27:39.884 --> 02:27:42.253
THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M STILL

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:44.655
NOT QUITE CLEAR. LIKE WHO'S THE

02:27:44.722 --> 02:27:47.858
DECISION MAKER WHEN ONE DECIDES

02:27:47.925 --> 02:27:50.761
WHAT IS A SERIOUS CASE THAT

02:27:50.828 --> 02:27:52.530
REQUIRES ONE VERSUS TWO LETTERS

02:27:52.597 --> 02:27:54.699
LIKE THE DIFFERENT LEVELS, WHO

02:27:54.765 --> 02:27:56.367
WHO IS THAT GOING TO BE AND

02:27:56.434 --> 02:27:58.903
WHAT IS THAT PROCESS? SO AS

02:27:58.970 --> 02:28:00.905
DAVID JUST STATED HERE, WE

02:28:00.972 --> 02:28:03.574
FIRST OF ALL ARE GOING TO

02:28:03.641 --> 02:28:04.208
INCORPORATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:28:04.275 --> 02:28:06.744
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE

02:28:06.811 --> 02:28:09.380
AUDIT TEAM, WHICH IS THAT WHEN

02:28:09.447 --> 02:28:10.548
A COMPLAINT COMES IN, IT WILL

02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:12.350
BE EVALUATED BY THE SEVERITY

02:28:12.416 --> 02:28:14.385
AND THE SURROUNDING FACTS TO

02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:17.288
THE LETTER. AND SO WE WILL BE

02:28:17.355 --> 02:28:18.889
FOCUSING IN ON THERE ARE

02:28:18.956 --> 02:28:20.191
BASICALLY THREE CATEGORIES AND

02:28:20.258 --> 02:28:21.592
THE THREE CATEGORIES THAT ARE

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:24.262
IN THE LABOR CODE ARE IMMINENT

02:28:24.328 --> 02:28:26.264
HAZARD, WHICH IS SOMETHING AS

02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:27.498
LIFE THREATENING, TO WHICH WE

02:28:27.565 --> 02:28:29.233
WILL BE ROLLING OUT ON IT. IF

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:30.501
IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS OF A

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:32.536
SERIOUS NATURE, LIKE A GUARD OR

02:28:32.603 --> 02:28:33.471
A TABLE SAW WITHOUT A GUARD,

02:28:33.537 --> 02:28:35.373
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE'LL BE

02:28:35.439 --> 02:28:36.607
ROLLING OUT ON. AND IT ALSO

02:28:36.674 --> 02:28:38.142
MANDATED AN OUTLINE IN THE

02:28:38.209 --> 02:28:39.510
LABOR CODE. AND THEN THE THIRD

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:41.512
ONE IS THOSE THAT ARE

02:28:41.579 --> 02:28:43.147
NON-SERIOUS NATURE. AND SO WHEN

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:44.415
THESE COMPLAINTS COME IN, IT IS

02:28:44.482 --> 02:28:45.616
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:47.118
DISTRICT MANAGER TO EVALUATE

02:28:47.184 --> 02:28:48.386
THOSE COMPLAINTS AND MAKE THAT

02:28:48.452 --> 02:28:49.587
DETERMINATION. IF THERE'S GOING

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:52.290
TO BE AN ON SITE INSPECTION OR

02:28:52.356 --> 02:28:55.059
NOT. AND SO THE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:56.360
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE

02:28:56.427 --> 02:28:59.397
AUDITORS IS THAT ONE, INITIALLY,

02:28:59.463 --> 02:29:00.364
IF IT'S GOING TO BE DECIDED

02:29:00.431 --> 02:29:02.300
THAT AN ON SITE LETTER IS GOING

02:29:02.366 --> 02:29:03.534
TO BE EVALUATED, IT WOULD NEED

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:05.136
TO BE DOCUMENTED. AND THE

02:29:05.202 --> 02:29:07.672
RATIONALE FOR DOING SO. HOWEVER,

02:29:07.738 --> 02:29:08.906
IF IT IS INDEED AN IMMINENT

02:29:08.973 --> 02:29:11.208
HAZARD OR SERIOUS HAZARD, IT

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:13.144
OUR TEAM WILL BE ROLLING OUT ON

02:29:13.210 --> 02:29:15.279
THOSE. AND SO THAT WILL BE MADE

02:29:15.346 --> 02:29:17.915
CLEAR IN OUR POLICY. AS I SAID,

02:29:17.982 --> 02:29:18.983
INCORPORATING WHAT THE AUDITORS

02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:20.351
HAVE RECOMMENDED IN THE EVENT

02:29:20.418 --> 02:29:21.519
THAT A LETTER WOULD BE

02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:22.320
GENERATED, IT WOULD BE

02:29:22.386 --> 02:29:24.221
SOMETHING THAT IS OF A

02:29:24.288 --> 02:29:26.123
NON-SERIOUS NATURE. IT WOULD BE

02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:28.159
SOMETHING IF I WERE TO GIVE AN

02:29:28.225 --> 02:29:29.427
EXAMPLE, LIKE A RECORD KEEPING,

02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:31.495
POSSIBLY. AND BUT ONCE AGAIN,

02:29:31.562 --> 02:29:32.296
WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE OUR

02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:35.966
PEOPLE EVALUATE WHAT SURROUNDS

02:29:36.033 --> 02:29:37.168
THE COMPLAINT ITSELF, THE

02:29:37.234 --> 02:29:39.303
SEVERITY AND THE FACTS WITH IT.

02:29:39.370 --> 02:29:41.906
IF A LETTER IS DECIDED, WE'RE

02:29:41.972 --> 02:29:42.540
TAKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

02:29:42.606 --> 02:29:47.011
A CALL WOULD BE MADE FIRST.

02:29:47.078 --> 02:29:49.480
STOP THERE, A CALL WOULD BE

02:29:49.547 --> 02:29:51.382
MADE. THE CALL WOULD BE MADE TO

02:29:51.449 --> 02:29:55.786
THE EMPLOYER. IN REGARDS TO THE

02:29:55.853 --> 02:29:58.122
COMPLAINT ALLEGATIONS. FROM

02:29:58.189 --> 02:30:01.025
THERE, THE COMPLAINT DEFINITELY

02:30:01.092 --> 02:30:03.127
WOULD BE NOTIFIED OF WHAT

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:05.296
PROCESSES HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN

02:30:05.363 --> 02:30:06.597
REGARDS TO THEIR COMPLAINT,

02:30:06.664 --> 02:30:08.165
PROVIDED THAT THE NAME AND

02:30:08.232 --> 02:30:09.467
INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN

02:30:09.533 --> 02:30:11.869
CONTACT THE PERSON IF THE

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:13.337
EMPLOYER DOES NOT RESPOND TO

02:30:13.404 --> 02:30:15.539
OUR COMPLAINT, THE POLICY WILL

02:30:15.606 --> 02:30:17.274
READ THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

02:30:17.341 --> 02:30:19.410
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW UP

02:30:19.477 --> 02:30:21.412
ON AND STAFF WILL HAVE TO ROLL

02:30:21.479 --> 02:30:25.649
OUT ON. GOT IT. THANK YOU FOR

02:30:25.716 --> 02:30:28.419
THAT. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, GIVEN

02:30:28.486 --> 02:30:30.488
YOUR STAFFING SHORTAGES, YOU

02:30:30.554 --> 02:30:33.324
KNOW, I APPRECIATE SOME EFFORT

02:30:33.391 --> 02:30:36.160
BEING PUT INTO THESE LETTERS. I

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:38.362
PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE THE WHOLE

02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:40.264
PROCESS TO STOP SENDING THESE

02:30:40.331 --> 02:30:42.400
LETTERS THAT HAVE NOT RESULTED

02:30:42.466 --> 02:30:45.536
IN MUCH. SO I WILL DEFINITELY

02:30:45.603 --> 02:30:48.105
BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THIS. I'LL

02:30:48.172 --> 02:30:51.308
MOVE ON TO MY SECOND QUESTION,

02:30:51.375 --> 02:30:54.178
WHICH IS THE LACK OF CRIMINAL

02:30:54.245 --> 02:30:57.081
REFERRALS TO PUBLIC PROSECUTORS.

02:30:57.148 --> 02:30:59.316
WHAT IS YOUR PROCESS THERE?

02:30:59.383 --> 02:31:02.119
WHEN DO YOU DECIDE THAT IT'S

02:31:02.186 --> 02:31:04.588
TIME TO HOLD AN EMPLOYER

02:31:04.655 --> 02:31:05.856
ACCOUNTABLE? IS IT AFTER THE

02:31:05.923 --> 02:31:08.526
FIRST DEATH? IS IT AFTER THE

02:31:08.592 --> 02:31:11.429
SECOND DEATH? IS IT AFTER THE

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:16.200
THIRD DEATH? THANK YOU FOR THE

02:31:16.267 --> 02:31:17.968
QUESTION. IF I CAN JUST HAVE A

02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:43.661
MOMENT. I'M SORRY. I.

02:31:51.836 --> 02:31:54.004
THINK.

02:31:54.071 --> 02:31:56.640
THANK YOU. I WANTED TO CHECK SO

02:31:56.707 --> 02:31:58.776
I CAN GIVE YOU THE RIGHT LABOR

02:31:58.843 --> 02:32:00.444
CODE. SO THAT COVER AND GOVERNS

02:32:00.511 --> 02:32:02.313
OUR PROCEDURES WITH OUR BOY

02:32:02.379 --> 02:32:04.381
UNIT. SO LABOR CODE SECTION

02:32:04.448 --> 02:32:07.918
6315 ESTABLISHES THE BUREAU OF

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:09.053
INVESTIGATION, WHICH WE REFER

02:32:09.119 --> 02:32:11.388
TO AS THE BOY UNIT. AND IT'S

02:32:11.455 --> 02:32:14.492
SET UP THE FRAMEWORK FOR

02:32:14.558 --> 02:32:16.660
INVESTIGATION. SO OUR BOY IS

02:32:16.727 --> 02:32:18.562
THEREBY TASKED WITH

02:32:18.629 --> 02:32:20.564
INVESTIGATING FATALITIES AND

02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:22.366
SERIOUS INJURIES THAT RESULT

02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:24.268
FROM A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF

02:32:24.335 --> 02:32:26.837
TITLE EIGHT FOR CRIMINAL

02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:28.205
INVESTIGATION. LABOR CODE,

02:32:28.272 --> 02:32:31.575
SECTION 64, 23 AND 64, 25 AND

02:32:31.642 --> 02:32:35.479
SIX 426 ARE ALSO OF THE

02:32:35.546 --> 02:32:36.247
AUTHORITY GIVES US THE

02:32:36.313 --> 02:32:39.350
AUTHORITY FOR OUR BOY TO USE

02:32:39.416 --> 02:32:42.186
AND MAKE CRIMINAL REFERRALS TO

02:32:42.253 --> 02:32:45.055
PROSECUTORS. THE MOST COMMON

02:32:45.122 --> 02:32:46.390
REFERRAL VEHICLE IS LABOR CODE

02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:49.360
SECTION 6425, FOR A WILLFUL

02:32:49.426 --> 02:32:52.263
VIOLATION OF A STANDARD CAUSING

02:32:52.329 --> 02:32:55.499
DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY TO AN

02:32:55.566 --> 02:32:57.835
EMPLOYEE, VIOLATION OF LABOR

02:32:57.902 --> 02:33:01.739
CODE SECTION 6425 OR CHARGES AS

02:33:01.805 --> 02:33:05.342
FELONY. SO OUR BOY UNIT, IN

02:33:05.409 --> 02:33:06.544
ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LABOR

02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:09.179
CODES AND REGULATIONS, AND THIS

02:33:09.246 --> 02:33:11.282
IS WHAT GOVERNS AND WHAT

02:33:11.348 --> 02:33:12.449
IDENTIFIES WHAT WOULD BE

02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:14.385
REFERRED OVER TO FOR CRIMINAL

02:33:14.451 --> 02:33:23.327
INVESTIGATION. SORRY, I DON'T

02:33:23.394 --> 02:33:26.096
HAVE THOSE CODES MEMORIZED. NO,

02:33:26.163 --> 02:33:28.499
NOR DID I HAVE THEM. WHEN I MET

02:33:28.566 --> 02:33:31.135
WITH THE WIDOW WHO SHOWED ME

02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:33.370
THE VIDEO OF HER HUSBAND BEING

02:33:33.437 --> 02:33:37.875
CRUSHED AFTER TWO OTHER WORKERS

02:33:37.942 --> 02:33:42.279
WERE KILLED. SO. I'M GOING TO

02:33:42.346 --> 02:33:46.250
ASK ANOTHER QUESTION. HOW MUCH

02:33:46.317 --> 02:33:48.419
WOULD IT COST FOR A DA TO

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:57.861
PROSECUTE ONE OF THESE CASES? I

02:33:57.928 --> 02:33:59.296
DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE THAT

02:33:59.363 --> 02:34:01.465
INFORMATION. I'D HAVE TO COME

02:34:01.532 --> 02:34:05.369
FROM THE DA. WELL, I, I REALLY

02:34:05.436 --> 02:34:13.243
SUGGEST YOU ASK THE DA BECAUSE.

02:34:13.310 --> 02:34:15.079
I AM GOING TO BE LOOKING INTO

02:34:15.145 --> 02:34:18.949
YOUR BUDGET AND GIVING YOUR

02:34:19.016 --> 02:34:21.652
STAFFING CONCERNS. IT'S CLEAR

02:34:21.719 --> 02:34:24.188
THAT YOU CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE

02:34:24.254 --> 02:34:27.291
THE CAPACITY TO INCREASE

02:34:27.358 --> 02:34:29.693
REFERRALS FOR CRIMINAL

02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:31.462
PROSECUTION. SO I WILL BE

02:34:31.528 --> 02:34:34.264
LOOKING INTO LEGISLATION THAT

02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:36.266
ENSURES EMPLOYERS ARE HELD

02:34:36.333 --> 02:34:38.168
ACCOUNTABLE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH

02:34:38.235 --> 02:34:39.803
CODE IT'S GOING TO FALL UNDER,

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:43.140
BUT I DO KNOW BOWDLER'S FACE. I

02:34:43.207 --> 02:34:47.311
DO KNOW THESE WORKERS AND THEIR

02:34:47.378 --> 02:34:50.714
FAMILIES. I DO KNOW THE FACE OF

02:34:50.781 --> 02:34:51.715
THIS EIGHT YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL

02:34:51.782 --> 02:34:53.350
WHO LOST HER LIFE AND COULD

02:34:53.417 --> 02:34:56.086
HAVE BEEN WHO'S, WHOSE DAD LOST

02:34:56.153 --> 02:34:58.188
HER HIS LIFE AND COULD HAVE

02:34:58.255 --> 02:35:00.190
BEEN PREVENTED. I MEAN, I DON'T

02:35:00.257 --> 02:35:01.759
THINK MY QUESTION WAS VERY

02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:04.528
DIFFICULT. WHEN IS AN EMPLOYER

02:35:04.595 --> 02:35:07.231
GOING TO BE HELD CRIMINALLY

02:35:07.297 --> 02:35:08.866
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DEATH OF

02:35:08.932 --> 02:35:10.701
EMPLOYEES IN THE WORKPLACE? IS

02:35:10.768 --> 02:35:12.536
IT AFTER THE FIRST DEATH? AFTER

02:35:12.603 --> 02:35:15.839
THE SECOND DEATH, AFTER THE

02:35:15.906 --> 02:35:18.742
THIRD DEATH? AND RIGHT NOW WHAT

02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:21.345
I'M SEEING IS THAT VERY FEW

02:35:21.412 --> 02:35:26.684
CASES, 1%, 1.7% WERE REFERRED

02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:30.287
FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. SO

02:35:30.354 --> 02:35:32.489
I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:34.291
LEGISLATION BECAUSE I DON'T

02:35:34.358 --> 02:35:35.559
WANT THIS HEARING, THIS AUDIT

02:35:35.626 --> 02:35:37.261
TO JUST BE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS.

02:35:37.327 --> 02:35:40.764
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:43.667
SOLUTIONS AND ADDRESS A LOT OF

02:35:43.734 --> 02:35:46.170
THE CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD. AND I

02:35:46.236 --> 02:35:48.305
WANT TO SEE ACTUAL

02:35:48.372 --> 02:35:51.308
ACCOUNTABILITY, BECAUSE, AGAIN,

02:35:51.375 --> 02:35:55.179
GOING BACK TO YOUR ROLE AND

02:35:55.245 --> 02:35:56.680
RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE 20

02:35:56.747 --> 02:35:59.983
MILLION WORKERS OF THE STATE IS

02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:03.520
TO ENFORCE THE HEALTH AND

02:36:03.587 --> 02:36:07.191
SAFETY OF WORKERS, AND EVERY

02:36:07.257 --> 02:36:09.593
WORKER IN THE STATE SHOULD HAVE

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.562
THE RIGHT TO GO HOME AT THE END

02:36:11.628 --> 02:36:16.366
OF THE DAY. MY LAST QUESTION IS

02:36:16.433 --> 02:36:20.270
AROUND THE FINES. SO IF A

02:36:20.337 --> 02:36:22.206
WORKER IS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO

02:36:22.272 --> 02:36:24.308
THROUGH THE PROCESS AFTER

02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:28.445
LETTERS ARE SENT AND YOU KNOW

02:36:28.512 --> 02:36:33.383
THEIR CASE IS MADE? WHO HAS THE

02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:38.055
AUTHORITY TO REDUCE THESE FINES?

02:36:38.122 --> 02:36:50.334
WHAT IS THE PROCESS? THERE'S IN

02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:52.669
TERMS OF A REDUCTION OF

02:36:52.736 --> 02:36:56.373
PENALTIES. THE DISTRICT MANAGER

02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.142
OR I SHOULD SAY THE THE

02:36:58.208 --> 02:37:02.479
EMPLOYER BEFORE THE THEY MAKE

02:37:02.546 --> 02:37:05.449
AN APPEAL, THE EMPLOYER CAN

02:37:05.516 --> 02:37:07.818
WORK WITH THE DISTRICT MANAGER

02:37:07.885 --> 02:37:10.888
AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO REDUCE

02:37:10.954 --> 02:37:12.256
SOME OF THE PENALTY

02:37:12.322 --> 02:37:16.160
CALCULATIONS. AFTER THE APPEAL

02:37:16.226 --> 02:37:21.031
PROCESS. THEN YOU KNOW IT IT

02:37:21.098 --> 02:37:23.300
IT'S UP TO THE APPEALS BOARD

02:37:23.367 --> 02:37:28.138
AND WORKING WITH. WITH THE

02:37:28.205 --> 02:37:30.240
BOARD AND THE APPEALS BOARD

02:37:30.307 --> 02:37:32.943
TYPICALLY WILL, YOU KNOW,

02:37:33.010 --> 02:37:37.381
REQUIRE. YOU KNOW, PRE-HEARING

02:37:37.447 --> 02:37:39.917
TALKS AND AND THEY TRY TO GUIDE

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:44.922
US THROUGH THAT. BUT THAT'S. GO

02:37:44.988 --> 02:37:46.390
AHEAD. SO THE FINES ARE SET IN

02:37:46.456 --> 02:37:50.561
OUR TITLE EIGHT REGULATIONS.

02:37:50.627 --> 02:37:53.530
AND SO THESE ARE IDENTIFIED THE

02:37:53.597 --> 02:37:56.099
BASE LEVEL OF EACH

02:37:56.166 --> 02:37:57.267
CLASSIFICATION OF A CITATION.

02:37:57.334 --> 02:37:59.469
SO A CITATION CAN START OFF AS

02:37:59.536 --> 02:38:02.506
A SERIOUS GENERAL OR A

02:38:02.573 --> 02:38:05.409
REGULATORY. AND SO WITHIN THE

02:38:05.475 --> 02:38:07.644
TITLE EIGHT RULES AND

02:38:07.711 --> 02:38:09.413
REGULATIONS IT IDENTIFIES WHAT

02:38:09.479 --> 02:38:10.380
WHERE THE PENALTY WAS STARTED.

02:38:10.447 --> 02:38:12.416
AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

02:38:12.482 --> 02:38:13.550
THAT THE AUDITORS DID GO INTO

02:38:13.617 --> 02:38:17.254
IN THEIR REPORT FROM THEIR

02:38:17.321 --> 02:38:20.123
WITHIN THE DISTRICT OFFICE. WE

02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:22.326
DO HAVE THINGS WHERE WHAT WE

02:38:22.392 --> 02:38:24.294
CALL INFORMAL CONFERENCES.

02:38:24.361 --> 02:38:26.330
THERE'S ALSO THE EMPLOYER HAS

02:38:26.396 --> 02:38:29.099
THE RIGHT TO APPEAL CITATIONS

02:38:29.166 --> 02:38:31.368
UNDER THAT RIGHT TO APPEAL. IT

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:34.238
GIVES THE DIVISION AND THE

02:38:34.304 --> 02:38:37.441
APPEALS BOARD THE ABILITY TO

02:38:37.507 --> 02:38:40.644
MEET WITH THE EMPLOYER, HAVE A

02:38:40.711 --> 02:38:42.112
DISCUSSION ON THE PENALTIES,

02:38:42.179 --> 02:38:45.215
BUT THE PENALTIES INITIALLY ARE

02:38:45.282 --> 02:38:53.223
SET BY TITLE EIGHT. TITLE EIGHT

02:38:53.290 --> 02:38:57.327
DECIDES THAT WHEN THE GRAND

02:38:57.394 --> 02:39:02.266
TOTAL OF FINES IS $18,000, THAT

02:39:02.332 --> 02:39:05.302
GETS REDUCED. I DON'T, I DON'T

02:39:05.369 --> 02:39:08.171
KNOW. IT OUTLINES STEP BY STEP

02:39:08.238 --> 02:39:10.274
WHERE YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE

02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:12.376
CERTAIN REDUCTIONS. SO IT WOULD

02:39:12.442 --> 02:39:13.911
SAY THAT A SERIOUS STARTS OFF

02:39:13.977 --> 02:39:16.647
AT 18,000. AND THEN THERE ARE

02:39:16.713 --> 02:39:18.582
OTHER ADJUSTMENT FACTORS THAT

02:39:18.649 --> 02:39:22.486
ALLOWS THE DIVISION TO LOOK AT

02:39:22.552 --> 02:39:24.288
AND TO CONSIDER. SO FROM THAT

02:39:24.354 --> 02:39:27.257
18,000 YOU THERE ARE OTHER

02:39:27.324 --> 02:39:31.094
MITIGATING AREAS THAT THE TITLE

02:39:31.161 --> 02:39:33.597
EIGHT ALLOWS YOU TO CONSIDER TO

02:39:33.664 --> 02:39:36.900
REDUCE THE PENALTY BY 25%, OR

02:39:36.967 --> 02:39:40.103
TO INCREASE THE PENALTY BY 25%.

02:39:40.170 --> 02:39:42.472
IT'S ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AT

02:39:42.539 --> 02:39:44.541
THE SIZE OF THE EMPLOYER, AND

02:39:44.608 --> 02:39:46.176
IT OUTLINES IF IT'S A SMALL

02:39:46.243 --> 02:39:47.311
EMPLOYER, WHAT TYPE OF

02:39:47.377 --> 02:39:48.512
REDUCTION THE PERSON CAN I MEAN,

02:39:48.578 --> 02:39:50.547
THE EMPLOYER CAN RECEIVE. IT

02:39:50.614 --> 02:39:53.350
TALKS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE

02:39:53.417 --> 02:39:55.419
OSHA HISTORY OF THE EMPLOYER,

02:39:55.485 --> 02:39:57.387
AND IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE

02:39:57.454 --> 02:39:58.422
GOOD FAITH OF THE EMPLOYER. AND

02:39:58.488 --> 02:40:00.390
THESE ARE ALL OUTLINED IN TITLE

02:40:00.457 --> 02:40:03.393
EIGHT TO WHICH STAFF WOULD

02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:07.397
FOLLOW THOSE REQUIREMENTS. SO

02:40:07.464 --> 02:40:10.300
SO THE EMPLOYER I HEARD

02:40:10.367 --> 02:40:11.635
EMPLOYER, EMPLOYEE, EMPLOYER A

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:14.771
LOT IN THAT STATEMENT. DIDN'T

02:40:14.838 --> 02:40:18.275
HEAR A WORKER A WHOLE LOT. SO

02:40:18.342 --> 02:40:19.509
I'M JUST TRYING TO I STILL

02:40:19.576 --> 02:40:21.211
HAVEN'T QUITE FIGURED OUT HOW,

02:40:21.278 --> 02:40:23.480
YOU KNOW, IN THE CASE. AGAIN,

02:40:23.547 --> 02:40:25.482
I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE

02:40:25.549 --> 02:40:27.617
CASE OF OF THE INCIDENT IN MY

02:40:27.684 --> 02:40:31.154
DISTRICT WHERE AFTER THE

02:40:31.221 --> 02:40:34.558
INVESTIGATION. AND THE THREE

02:40:34.624 --> 02:40:38.695
DEATHS, IT WAS $18,000 IN FINES.

02:40:38.762 --> 02:40:41.331
AND SO THAT AVERAGED OUT TO

02:40:41.398 --> 02:40:47.404
$6,000 PER EMPLOYEE KILLED. IS

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:49.940
THAT IN SO THAT YOU'RE TELLING

02:40:50.007 --> 02:40:53.577
ME THAT'S ALL IN TITLE EIGHT?

02:40:53.643 --> 02:40:56.747
I'M SAYING THAT TITLE EIGHT

02:40:56.813 --> 02:40:58.515
OUTLINES THE BASE, THE GRAVITY

02:40:58.582 --> 02:41:01.485
BASE OF THE PENALTY, AND THAT'S

02:41:01.551 --> 02:41:03.587
WRITTEN INTO AND THAT'S THOSE

02:41:03.653 --> 02:41:04.488
ARE THE REGULATIONS THAT WE

02:41:04.554 --> 02:41:06.656
WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW. SO WHERE

02:41:06.723 --> 02:41:08.525
DO THE WORKERS FALL IN TITLE

02:41:08.592 --> 02:41:10.494
EIGHT. WHEN DO THEY HAVE A SAY

02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:13.964
IN IN HOW MUCH THEIR FATHER SON

02:41:14.031 --> 02:41:15.132
FRIEND IS WORTH? YOU CAN'T PUT

02:41:15.198 --> 02:41:20.504
A PRICE ON A LIFE. AND BUT WE

02:41:20.570 --> 02:41:21.671
ARE WE'RE PUTTING A PRICE ON

02:41:21.738 --> 02:41:25.342
THEIR LIVES. WELL. SO WHERE

02:41:25.409 --> 02:41:28.311
WHERE DOES THE WORKER HAVE A

02:41:28.378 --> 02:41:30.714
SAY OR THE FAMILY MEMBERS IN

02:41:30.781 --> 02:41:34.051
THIS PROCESS? IT'S NOT OUTLINED

02:41:34.117 --> 02:41:37.354
IN TITLE EIGHT. SO WHERE IS IT?

02:41:37.421 --> 02:41:39.623
THOSE ARE THE RULES. I MEAN

02:41:39.689 --> 02:41:41.658
THOSE ARE THE LAWS THAT

02:41:41.725 --> 02:41:43.326
CAL-OSHA HAVE TO FOLLOW IN

02:41:43.393 --> 02:41:45.395
DEALING WITH THE PENALTIES. I

02:41:45.462 --> 02:41:47.330
WAS A GRAVITY BASE, AND I AND I

02:41:47.397 --> 02:41:49.866
DO BELIEVE THE AUDITORS DID

02:41:49.933 --> 02:41:51.201
IDENTIFY THAT IN THEIR AUDIT.

02:41:51.268 --> 02:41:54.371
SO WHERE WHERE IS. YEAH. AND IF

02:41:54.438 --> 02:41:57.207
TO THE AUDITORS PLEASE CAN YOU

02:41:57.274 --> 02:41:58.475
TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

02:41:58.542 --> 02:42:00.077
THE FINES AND WHAT YOU DIDN'T

02:42:00.143 --> 02:42:02.245
FIND. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:42:02.312 --> 02:42:05.015
WE DIDN'T FIND, YOU WERE ASKING

02:42:05.082 --> 02:42:06.149
ABOUT REFERRALS TO PROSECUTION,

02:42:06.216 --> 02:42:08.418
WHAT WE DIDN'T FIND WAS CAL

02:42:08.485 --> 02:42:10.253
OSHA HAVING POLICIES THAT

02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:13.123
DESCRIBE WHEN TO REFER OR WHEN

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:15.292
NOT TO REFER CASES. I

02:42:15.358 --> 02:42:16.860
UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW, WE

02:42:16.927 --> 02:42:18.328
CAN CITE CODE, BUT AS AUDITORS,

02:42:18.395 --> 02:42:20.297
WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:42:20.363 --> 02:42:21.398
WERE THE ACTUAL POLICIES AND

02:42:21.465 --> 02:42:23.133
PRACTICES CAL OSHA DEVELOPED

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.235
FOR ITS STAFF. THEY DIDN'T HAVE

02:42:25.302 --> 02:42:27.237
ANY FOR WHEN TO REFER CASES FOR

02:42:27.304 --> 02:42:29.306
PROSECUTION. AND WE HAVE A

02:42:29.372 --> 02:42:30.907
GRAPHIC IN OUR AUDIT REPORT ON

02:42:30.974 --> 02:42:33.110
PAGE 43, FIGURE 13, WHERE WE

02:42:33.176 --> 02:42:36.113
DESCRIBE A CASE WHERE CAL OSHA

02:42:36.179 --> 02:42:37.414
FELT LIKE IT HAD ENOUGH

02:42:37.481 --> 02:42:40.050
EVIDENCE TO FIND AN EMPLOYER

02:42:40.117 --> 02:42:41.918
$78,000, BUT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:42:41.985 --> 02:42:44.321
EVIDENCE TO REFER THAT CASE FOR

02:42:44.387 --> 02:42:46.123
PROSECUTION. AND SO WHEN WE

02:42:46.189 --> 02:42:48.325
SPOKE WITH STAFF THAT WOULD BE

02:42:48.391 --> 02:42:49.392
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, THEY

02:42:49.459 --> 02:42:50.260
INDICATED THAT THEY WERE IN THE

02:42:50.327 --> 02:42:52.896
PROCESS OF DEVELOPING POLICIES

02:42:52.963 --> 02:42:54.097
THAT WOULD CLARIFY WHEN THEY

02:42:54.164 --> 02:42:55.765
WOULD REFER CASES FOR

02:42:55.832 --> 02:42:57.467
PROSECUTION VERSUS WHEN THEY

02:42:57.534 --> 02:43:04.207
WOULD NOT. SO WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:43:04.274 --> 02:43:07.544
POLICIES IN PLACE. THE POLICIES

02:43:07.611 --> 02:43:10.714
ARE BEING DEVELOPED. AND I DO

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:11.515
BELIEVE WE PROVIDED THE OUTLINE

02:43:11.581 --> 02:43:14.951
AS THE DEADLINE. WE HAVE

02:43:15.018 --> 02:43:18.922
GUIDELINES IN PLACE WITHIN OUR

02:43:18.989 --> 02:43:20.524
VÚI INVESTIGATION. AS THE AUDIT

02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:23.660
STATED, IT IS NOT SPELLED OUT

02:43:23.727 --> 02:43:25.629
IN A POLICY, AND THAT IS

02:43:25.695 --> 02:43:27.197
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

02:43:27.264 --> 02:43:28.999
DEVELOPING AND THAT WE WILL

02:43:29.065 --> 02:43:36.206
HAVE BY THE END OF THIS MONTH.

02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:38.608
SO I MEAN, THAT'S ON THE ISSUE

02:43:38.675 --> 02:43:40.277
OF THE I'M GOING TO MOVE ON

02:43:40.343 --> 02:43:41.645
FROM THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION

02:43:41.711 --> 02:43:44.214
ON THE ISSUE OF THE FINES. THIS

02:43:44.281 --> 02:43:47.350
AUDIT SAID THAT CAL OSHA

02:43:47.417 --> 02:43:49.186
DOESN'T HAVE POLICIES, NOR DO

02:43:49.252 --> 02:43:51.454
STAFF TO JUSTIFY WHY THEY

02:43:51.521 --> 02:43:54.357
REDUCE THE FINES. AND I STILL

02:43:54.424 --> 02:43:57.160
HAVEN'T HEARD THAT. I'VE JUST

02:43:57.227 --> 02:43:59.229
HEARD CODES REFERENCE. SO WHAT

02:43:59.296 --> 02:44:01.698
IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR

02:44:01.765 --> 02:44:05.802
REDUCING THESE FINES? THANK YOU.

02:44:05.869 --> 02:44:06.970
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION,

02:44:07.037 --> 02:44:10.440
CHAIRWOMAN. WE AGREE WITH THE

02:44:10.507 --> 02:44:12.943
AUDITOR'S FINDINGS THAT WE ARE

02:44:13.009 --> 02:44:15.478
NOT CAPTURING THAT THAT

02:44:15.545 --> 02:44:17.347
INFORMATION, THAT REASON FOR

02:44:17.414 --> 02:44:20.884
THE THE REDUCTION, OFTENTIMES

02:44:20.951 --> 02:44:22.352
THE INFORMATION WE ARE

02:44:22.419 --> 02:44:26.289
CAPTURING ARE THE BITS OF THE

02:44:26.356 --> 02:44:30.227
TITLE EIGHT THAT ALLOW CERTAIN

02:44:30.293 --> 02:44:32.963
CHANGES. SO THOSE WILL BE

02:44:33.029 --> 02:44:35.632
REFERENCED, BUT NOT THE REASON

02:44:35.699 --> 02:44:37.167
WHY THOSE CHANGES WERE MADE. SO

02:44:37.234 --> 02:44:38.368
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING

02:44:38.435 --> 02:44:39.536
INTO OUR POLICIES AND

02:44:39.603 --> 02:44:41.371
PROCEDURES. THIS WILL BE

02:44:41.438 --> 02:44:42.239
SOMETHING THAT WE TRAIN ON AND

02:44:42.305 --> 02:44:45.642
SOMETHING THAT WE DO FOLLOW UP

02:44:45.709 --> 02:44:47.210
AUDITS WITH OUR STAFF TO VERIFY

02:44:47.277 --> 02:44:49.613
THAT THAT THAT'S BEING

02:44:49.679 --> 02:44:52.215
INCORPORATED. YEAH, MAYBE MAYBE

02:44:52.282 --> 02:44:54.317
MY COLLEAGUES AND I SHOULD LOOK

02:44:54.384 --> 02:44:56.586
INTO CREATING THAT POLICY FOR

02:44:56.653 --> 02:44:59.756
YOU. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU.

02:44:59.823 --> 02:45:02.158
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

02:45:02.225 --> 02:45:05.195
CHAIRWOMAN SMALLWOOD. CUEVAS.

02:45:05.262 --> 02:45:09.566
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND. YEAH,

02:45:09.633 --> 02:45:12.335
I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:45:12.402 --> 02:45:13.503
BILLS AND POLICIES WE NEED TO

02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:19.576
CONSIDER IN THIS PROCESS. ONE

02:45:19.643 --> 02:45:21.778
BEING THAT WHEN A LIFE IS LOST

02:45:21.845 --> 02:45:24.514
ON THE JOB DUE TO EMPLOYER

02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:28.184
NEGLIGENCE. THERE'S SOME

02:45:28.251 --> 02:45:30.987
OVERSIGHT IN HOW THOSE

02:45:31.054 --> 02:45:32.622
PENALTIES GET ADJUSTED. AND WE

02:45:32.689 --> 02:45:35.325
SHOULD NOT BE LOWERING THE

02:45:35.392 --> 02:45:37.527
VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE IN

02:45:37.594 --> 02:45:40.430
CALIFORNIA WORKPLACES. AND I

02:45:40.497 --> 02:45:44.401
HAVE A QUESTION IN TERMS OF, I

02:45:44.467 --> 02:45:46.836
THINK THE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE

02:45:46.903 --> 02:45:48.405
ASSEMBLY WAS GETTING AT THE

02:45:48.471 --> 02:45:52.309
ROLE OF WORKERS IN THIS PROCESS.

02:45:52.375 --> 02:45:54.144
WHAT WHAT PROCESS DOES THE

02:45:54.210 --> 02:45:58.815
PUBLIC HAVE OR WORKERS WHO.

02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:02.686
FEEL THAT THE DEPARTMENT FAILED

02:46:02.752 --> 02:46:03.987
THEM, FAILED THEIR LOVED ONES

02:46:04.054 --> 02:46:07.090
WHO WERE KILLED ON THE JOB?

02:46:07.157 --> 02:46:10.660
WHAT PROCESS DO THEY HAVE TO

02:46:10.727 --> 02:46:14.664
CHALLENGE, RATE, EVALUATE THE

02:46:14.731 --> 02:46:18.234
PERFORMANCE OF CAL OSHA? I

02:46:18.301 --> 02:46:20.737
ASKED THIS QUESTION BECAUSE

02:46:20.804 --> 02:46:23.673
GIVEN THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS

02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:26.142
PRESENTED TODAY, WE'RE TALKING

02:46:26.209 --> 02:46:33.983
DECADES OF. BARRIERS TO QUALITY

02:46:34.050 --> 02:46:36.286
ENFORCEMENT AND DECADES OF

02:46:36.353 --> 02:46:39.856
NEGLIGENCE AS IT REALLY RELATES

02:46:39.923 --> 02:46:43.393
TO ENSURING THAT WORKERS.

02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:46.963
RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED, EMPLOYERS

02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:48.765
ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, AND THE

02:46:48.832 --> 02:46:49.866
STATE OF CALIFORNIA LAWS ARE

02:46:49.933 --> 02:46:53.136
BEING PROPERLY ENFORCED. IS

02:46:53.203 --> 02:46:55.805
THERE A WHAT IS THE APPEALS

02:46:55.872 --> 02:46:58.575
PROCESS? WHAT IS THE WAY? IS

02:46:58.641 --> 02:47:00.744
THERE A LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR

02:47:00.810 --> 02:47:05.348
THE AGENCY AS IT RELATES TO

02:47:05.415 --> 02:47:08.385
WORKERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

02:47:08.451 --> 02:47:13.623
HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY. SOME OF

02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:16.192
THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS SHARED

02:47:16.259 --> 02:47:18.027
WITH US TODAY IN TERMS OF

02:47:18.094 --> 02:47:20.163
POLICIES, PROCEDURES, DUTIES,

02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:22.432
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:47:22.499 --> 02:47:29.239
NOT PERFORMED WELL. THANK YOU

02:47:29.305 --> 02:47:32.442
FOR THE QUESTION. AND I THINK

02:47:32.509 --> 02:47:34.611
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

02:47:34.677 --> 02:47:37.514
DIVISION IS GOING TO HAVE TO

02:47:37.580 --> 02:47:43.586
LOOK INTO AND TO DEVELOP NOW

02:47:43.653 --> 02:47:46.756
WITH CITATIONS ARE ISSUED.

02:47:46.823 --> 02:47:48.725
THOSE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY IT

02:47:48.792 --> 02:47:50.693
ARE ENTITLED TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:53.430
THE INFORMAL AND TO BE NOTIFIED

02:47:53.496 --> 02:47:55.432
OF THE INFORMAL CONFERENCE, TO

02:47:55.498 --> 02:47:59.202
BE NOTIFIED OF ANY PREHEARING

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:01.805
CONFERENCES, AND ALSO TO BE

02:48:01.871 --> 02:48:02.906
NOTIFIED OF THE ACTUAL HEARING

02:48:02.972 --> 02:48:05.442
IF IT MAKES IT ALL THE WAY TO A

02:48:05.508 --> 02:48:07.844
HEARING, AND TO BE AWARE OF

02:48:07.911 --> 02:48:10.513
THOSE AND TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:12.615
THEM, IT'S WHAT IS OFFERED. I

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:15.285
MEAN, WHAT IS, IS, IS THERE NOW

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:17.520
WHEN WE ISSUE CITATIONS, IT IS

02:48:17.587 --> 02:48:20.356
THEY ARE TO BE NOTIFIED OF ALL

02:48:20.423 --> 02:48:22.725
OF THOSE ACTIONS ALL THE WAY UP

02:48:22.792 --> 02:48:24.327
TO THE HEARING. YEAH, I THINK

02:48:24.394 --> 02:48:26.362
THAT'S A THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE

02:48:26.429 --> 02:48:29.232
OF POLICY WE NEED TO TO LOOK AT

02:48:29.299 --> 02:48:31.468
MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE SHOULD

02:48:31.534 --> 02:48:33.603
HAD THERE BEEN A PROCESS FOR

02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:34.537
THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE IN THIS,

02:48:34.604 --> 02:48:36.206
WE MIGHT NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS

02:48:36.272 --> 02:48:38.808
IN A REAR VIEW AND SEEING THE

02:48:38.875 --> 02:48:41.444
WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVEN'T MET,

02:48:41.511 --> 02:48:43.279
THE GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

02:48:43.346 --> 02:48:44.314
HOW THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:47.684
WOULD WANT TO SEE THEIR

02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:48.952
WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH

02:48:49.018 --> 02:48:52.489
LAWS ENFORCE. SO I AGREE THERE

02:48:52.555 --> 02:48:54.991
IS A ROLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO

02:48:55.058 --> 02:48:57.360
PLAY IN ENSURING THAT THE

02:48:57.427 --> 02:49:00.930
AGENCY IS PROPERLY HAS PROPER

02:49:00.997 --> 02:49:02.732
OVERSIGHT IN HOW THESE CASES

02:49:02.799 --> 02:49:08.137
ARE HANDLED. I WANT TO MOVE TO

02:49:08.204 --> 02:49:10.006
A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I

02:49:10.073 --> 02:49:14.611
HAVE. AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO

02:49:14.677 --> 02:49:18.615
THE LETTERS BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY

02:49:18.681 --> 02:49:22.185
BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THESE

02:49:22.252 --> 02:49:24.420
COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATIONS ARE

02:49:24.487 --> 02:49:26.823
DEALT WITH THROUGH A LETTER

02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:29.492
THAT ESSENTIALLY SAYS TO THE

02:49:29.559 --> 02:49:32.529
EMPLOYER, THIS IS THE PROBLEM,

02:49:32.595 --> 02:49:34.197
AND ALL THE EMPLOYER HAS TO DO

02:49:34.264 --> 02:49:36.699
IS SAY, I'VE TAKEN CARE OF IT

02:49:36.766 --> 02:49:39.435
AND NOTHING HAPPENS. WE'VE,

02:49:39.502 --> 02:49:44.140
WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND.

02:49:44.207 --> 02:49:47.777
HOW WE ARE RESPONDING TO THE

02:49:47.844 --> 02:49:49.345
COMPLAINTS AND WHAT IS THE

02:49:49.412 --> 02:49:52.549
MECHANISM TO SORT OF HAVE A

02:49:52.615 --> 02:49:57.153
BACKSTOP AND CHECK ON NOT ONLY

02:49:57.220 --> 02:49:58.388
THAT THE COMPLAINTS ARE GOING

02:49:58.454 --> 02:50:01.791
OUT AND WHAT THEY ARE, BUT ALSO

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:03.393
VERIFYING WHAT THE EMPLOYER IS

02:50:03.459 --> 02:50:06.029
SAYING IN THOSE LETTERS TO

02:50:06.095 --> 02:50:09.666
ENSURE THAT THE CORRECTIONS,

02:50:09.732 --> 02:50:14.370
THE NECESSARY STEPS HAVE BEEN

02:50:14.437 --> 02:50:16.205
FOLLOWED. WHAT IS THE MECHANISM

02:50:16.272 --> 02:50:19.375
THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE TO ONE

02:50:19.442 --> 02:50:21.411
ADDRESS? YOU KNOW HOW THESE

02:50:21.477 --> 02:50:23.346
LETTERS FIT INTO THE

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:27.584
ENFORCEMENT PROCESS, BUT ALSO

02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:30.720
HOW DOES IT TRIGGER ON SITE

02:50:30.787 --> 02:50:32.689
ENFORCEMENT? HOW WILL IT

02:50:32.755 --> 02:50:34.123
TRIGGER SOME SENSE OF

02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:36.326
VERIFICATION? AND THEN HOW DOES

02:50:36.392 --> 02:50:39.162
IT COME BACK TO THE STATE IN

02:50:39.228 --> 02:50:42.098
TERMS OF CLOSING OUT WHETHER OR

02:50:42.165 --> 02:50:44.267
NOT THESE THE INVESTIGATION

02:50:44.334 --> 02:50:46.169
CONTINUES AND CAN CAN BE

02:50:46.235 --> 02:50:49.772
BROUGHT TO A SUITABLE AND

02:50:49.839 --> 02:50:53.409
ADEQUATE SUMMATION IN TERMS OF,

02:50:53.476 --> 02:50:54.844
YOU KNOW, WHAT FINDS A

02:50:54.911 --> 02:50:56.179
PENALTIES, WHAT CITATIONS ARE

02:50:56.245 --> 02:50:58.414
LEVIED, YOU KNOW, WHAT SUPPORT

02:50:58.481 --> 02:51:00.617
THERE NEEDS TO BE FOR FOR THE

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:08.324
WORKER. OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU

02:51:08.391 --> 02:51:15.164
FOR THE QUESTION. THE WITH

02:51:15.231 --> 02:51:18.134
REGARD TO THE TO THE LETTER

02:51:18.201 --> 02:51:25.274
INVESTIGATIONS. THERE IS THE WE

02:51:25.341 --> 02:51:26.643
WE HAVE REQUIREMENTS AND HAVE

02:51:26.709 --> 02:51:29.245
HAD REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE FOR

02:51:29.312 --> 02:51:37.487
REVIEW OF RESPONSES. WE HAVE.

02:51:37.553 --> 02:51:43.259
WE HAVE OVERSIGHT OF MANAGEMENT

02:51:43.326 --> 02:51:45.028
OVERSIGHT. EXCUSE ME OF OF ALL

02:51:45.094 --> 02:51:48.364
OF THESE PROCESSES. IT'S NOT

02:51:48.431 --> 02:51:52.568
EASY FOR US TO, TO TRACK ALL OF

02:51:52.635 --> 02:51:56.239
THESE, THESE ISSUES. OUR DATA

02:51:56.305 --> 02:51:57.640
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WE'RE

02:51:57.707 --> 02:51:59.742
TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE WILL

02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:02.412
HELP US IMMENSELY IN DOING THAT.

02:52:02.478 --> 02:52:04.180
PART OF WHAT WE'RE FINDING AS

02:52:04.247 --> 02:52:08.051
WE LOOK AT THE WAY WE DO

02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:10.520
BUSINESS IS STRUCTURALLY, WE

02:52:10.586 --> 02:52:13.456
HAVE A LOT OF WORK THAT'S BEING

02:52:13.523 --> 02:52:16.426
DONE IN THE DISTRICT OFFICE,

02:52:16.492 --> 02:52:18.127
AND WE WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

02:52:18.194 --> 02:52:22.098
AT WHETHER OUR OUR STRUCTURE,

02:52:22.165 --> 02:52:23.833
OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IS

02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:27.603
ADEQUATE FOR HANDLING THE THE

02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:29.672
LETTER INVESTIGATIONS IN THE

02:52:29.739 --> 02:52:31.507
SAME OFFICE THAT IS HANDLING

02:52:31.574 --> 02:52:34.711
THE ON SITE INSPECTIONS.

02:52:34.777 --> 02:52:39.082
THERE'S A A TENDENCY TO TO HAVE

02:52:39.148 --> 02:52:42.552
PRIORITY OVER THE ON SITE

02:52:42.618 --> 02:52:44.153
INSPECTIONS. AND WE JUST NEED

02:52:44.220 --> 02:52:48.024
TO ADDRESS WITH OUR MANAGERS

02:52:48.091 --> 02:52:51.427
THAT THEY CONTINUE TO FOLLOW

02:52:51.494 --> 02:52:54.197
ALL THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

02:52:54.263 --> 02:52:56.332
REGARDING THE LETTER

02:52:56.399 --> 02:52:59.202
INVESTIGATIONS. WHEN DONE

02:52:59.268 --> 02:53:03.806
CORRECTLY AND EFFECTIVELY, WE

02:53:03.873 --> 02:53:05.808
HAVE THE RESPONSES TO THE

02:53:05.875 --> 02:53:06.943
LETTER INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD BE

02:53:07.009 --> 02:53:08.611
REVIEWED AND IF THEY'RE NOT

02:53:08.678 --> 02:53:10.079
ADEQUATE, WE CONTINUE TO WORK

02:53:10.146 --> 02:53:12.215
WITH THE EMPLOYER UNTIL WE CAN

02:53:12.281 --> 02:53:13.316
DETERMINE THAT THEY ARE

02:53:13.382 --> 02:53:15.752
ADEQUATE. AND IF WE'RE NOT

02:53:15.818 --> 02:53:18.654
SEEING WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE,

02:53:18.721 --> 02:53:20.256
THEN WE CAN GO OUT FOR AN ON

02:53:20.323 --> 02:53:22.325
SITE INSPECTION. IF WE GET NO

02:53:22.391 --> 02:53:24.160
RESPONSE AT ALL, WE SHOULD GO

02:53:24.227 --> 02:53:27.563
OUT ON AN ON SITE INSPECTION,

02:53:27.630 --> 02:53:29.832
AND THEN WE SHOULD ALSO

02:53:29.899 --> 02:53:32.401
PERIODICALLY. GO DO ON SITE

02:53:32.468 --> 02:53:35.304
INSPECTIONS TO VERIFY THAT THE

02:53:35.371 --> 02:53:37.306
ONES THAT WE PREVIOUSLY

02:53:37.373 --> 02:53:40.209
APPROVED ARE, IN FACT,

02:53:40.276 --> 02:53:44.213
ADEQUATELY IMPLEMENTED. SO

02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:46.382
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT THAT

02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:48.918
WE WE RECOGNIZE WE'RE NOT DOING

02:53:48.985 --> 02:53:52.088
WELL AND, AND NEED TO CONTINUE

02:53:52.155 --> 02:53:55.391
TO, TO TRAIN AND TO AUDIT AND

02:53:55.458 --> 02:53:58.995
IF NECESSARY, TO CHANGE OUR

02:53:59.061 --> 02:53:59.562
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE SO

02:53:59.629 --> 02:54:00.396
THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THESE

02:54:00.463 --> 02:54:03.366
THINGS. WELL. AND I WANT TO SAY,

02:54:03.432 --> 02:54:05.201
OH, I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD. I WAS

02:54:05.268 --> 02:54:07.236
GOING TO ADD TO ONE OF THE

02:54:07.303 --> 02:54:08.504
THINGS THAT THE AUDITORS DID

02:54:08.571 --> 02:54:09.539
POINT OUT THAT WE'RE ALSO

02:54:09.605 --> 02:54:10.706
INCORPORATING IS WHAT IS

02:54:10.773 --> 02:54:11.374
SATISFACTORY, WHAT IS

02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:13.409
ACCEPTABLE. AND SO WHEN THE

02:54:13.476 --> 02:54:15.511
RESPONSES ARE COMING BACK TO US

02:54:15.578 --> 02:54:17.713
FROM EMPLOYERS, THEY WOULD NEED

02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:19.649
TO VIDEO, PHOTOGRAPHS, REPORTS.

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:22.351
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THAT

02:54:22.418 --> 02:54:25.254
WHAT WAS SENT OUT AS A CONCERN

02:54:25.321 --> 02:54:27.423
HAS TRULY BEEN ABATED. AND THEN,

02:54:27.490 --> 02:54:29.192
AS DAVID WAS JUST MENTIONING,

02:54:29.258 --> 02:54:31.494
WE WOULD DO SOME RANDOMLY

02:54:31.561 --> 02:54:33.529
SELECTING SOME OF THOSE

02:54:33.596 --> 02:54:34.330
SATISFACTORY COMPLAINTS. AND

02:54:34.397 --> 02:54:36.866
THAT'S PEOPLE HAVE OUR TEAM GO

02:54:36.933 --> 02:54:38.568
OUT AND CONDUCT AN

02:54:38.634 --> 02:54:40.436
INVESTIGATION TO VERIFY WHAT

02:54:40.503 --> 02:54:41.637
THEY SAID THEY ACTUALLY

02:54:41.704 --> 02:54:44.340
INSTALLED. THEY ACTUALLY DID

02:54:44.407 --> 02:54:47.043
ALSO FOR ON SITE INSPECTIONS.

02:54:47.109 --> 02:54:48.911
THE OTHER RECOMMENDATION, TOO,

02:54:48.978 --> 02:54:50.146
WAS ALSO IDENTIFYING THAT WHEN

02:54:50.213 --> 02:54:52.381
OUR TEAMS ARE OUT THERE, WHAT

02:54:52.448 --> 02:54:54.517
IS KEY THAT THE AUDIT HAS

02:54:54.584 --> 02:54:56.285
POINTED OUT IS THAT WE NEED TO

02:54:56.352 --> 02:54:57.420
COLLECT THE EVIDENCE SO THAT

02:54:57.486 --> 02:54:59.288
WE'RE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON

02:54:59.355 --> 02:55:02.425
AND UPHELD THE CITATIONS, AND

02:55:02.491 --> 02:55:05.294
ALSO TO UPHELD CITATIONS THAT

02:55:05.361 --> 02:55:07.396
ARE SERIOUS AND ALSO ACCIDENT

02:55:07.463 --> 02:55:09.165
RELATED. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

02:55:09.232 --> 02:55:12.101
BE HAVING PEOPLE GO OUT AND

02:55:12.168 --> 02:55:14.770
AUDIT FORM TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT

02:55:14.837 --> 02:55:16.372
OUR INSPECTORS ARE ALSO DOING

02:55:16.439 --> 02:55:19.242
OUT IN THE FIELD AND VERIFYING

02:55:19.308 --> 02:55:21.410
THAT THEY HAVE INDEED

02:55:21.477 --> 02:55:22.345
IDENTIFIED THE HAZARDS THAT

02:55:22.411 --> 02:55:24.547
WERE THERE. AND SO THAT WOULD

02:55:24.614 --> 02:55:26.716
BE ANOTHER FORM OF AUDITING

02:55:26.782 --> 02:55:27.817
THAT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED THAT

02:55:27.884 --> 02:55:29.452
WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT

02:55:29.518 --> 02:55:32.855
INCORPORATING. AND I APPRECIATE

02:55:32.922 --> 02:55:35.758
THAT PROCESS BEING PUT IN PLACE.

02:55:35.825 --> 02:55:38.427
AND WE WILL BE A CHECK AND

02:55:38.494 --> 02:55:39.562
BALANCE ON WHETHER THAT IS

02:55:39.629 --> 02:55:41.230
EFFECTIVE OR NOT, AS THESE

02:55:41.297 --> 02:55:43.733
AUDITS WILL BE DONE BY THE BY

02:55:43.799 --> 02:55:45.534
THE AUDITOR AND ALSO BY YOUR

02:55:45.601 --> 02:55:49.472
YOUR AGENCY. BUT I WILL SAY IN

02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:53.242
LA COUNTY, WHEN WE LOOK AT AND

02:55:53.309 --> 02:55:55.411
I'M GOING TO USE WAGE THEFT AS

02:55:55.478 --> 02:55:57.246
AN EXAMPLE, AND I THINK WE HAVE

02:55:57.313 --> 02:55:59.782
A SIMILAR MODEL WITH OUR LABOR

02:55:59.849 --> 02:56:00.616
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE, WHERE WE

02:56:00.683 --> 02:56:02.218
HAVE SOME OF THE SAME

02:56:02.285 --> 02:56:05.321
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF

02:56:05.388 --> 02:56:07.890
ENFORCEMENT AND OUTCOMES. YOU

02:56:07.957 --> 02:56:10.726
KNOW, WE NEED MORE BOOTS ON THE

02:56:10.793 --> 02:56:14.730
GROUND. WE CAN'T HIRE ENOUGH

02:56:14.797 --> 02:56:17.333
INVESTIGATORS TO POLICE EVERY

02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:19.869
SINGLE WORK SITE, AND TO MAKE

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:21.370
SURE THAT PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND

02:56:21.437 --> 02:56:24.073
SAFETY IS BEING UPHELD WITHOUT

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:26.442
WITHOUT ENLISTING THE SUPPORT

02:56:26.509 --> 02:56:28.411
OF THE WORKERS THEMSELVES,

02:56:28.477 --> 02:56:30.613
WITHOUT ENLISTING WORKER

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:32.415
ORGANIZATIONS, WITHOUT

02:56:32.481 --> 02:56:37.420
DEPUTIZING TRAINED, EXPERIENCED

02:56:37.486 --> 02:56:40.456
INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN ASSIST IN

02:56:40.523 --> 02:56:43.192
MAKING SURE AND VERIFYING THESE

02:56:43.259 --> 02:56:44.360
CONDITIONS. WORKERS WANT TO

02:56:44.427 --> 02:56:46.362
WORK IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT, AND

02:56:46.429 --> 02:56:47.296
THEY KNOW WHAT SAFE MEANS, AND

02:56:47.363 --> 02:56:49.231
THEY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE UNSAFE.

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:51.600
AND SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT

02:56:51.667 --> 02:56:53.602
WE ARE WORKING AND EXPANDING

02:56:53.669 --> 02:56:55.404
OUR PARTNERSHIPS TO PUT MORE

02:56:55.471 --> 02:56:57.940
BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO MAKE

02:56:58.007 --> 02:57:01.844
THIS HAPPEN? IT IS. IMPORTANT

02:57:01.911 --> 02:57:03.546
PROCEDURES THAT WORK. IT IS

02:57:03.612 --> 02:57:05.181
IMPORTANT TO HAVE POLICIES,

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:06.382
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE INVESTING

02:57:06.449 --> 02:57:08.284
SO MUCH IN THIS AGENCY TO BE

02:57:08.351 --> 02:57:10.753
ABLE TO DO ITS JOB. BUT AT THE

02:57:10.820 --> 02:57:11.921
SAME TIME, IT'S THE

02:57:11.988 --> 02:57:13.456
RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS AGENCY

02:57:13.522 --> 02:57:14.557
TO HAVE ADEQUATE BOOTS ON THE

02:57:14.623 --> 02:57:16.625
GROUNDS OF RELATIONSHIPS OF OF

02:57:16.692 --> 02:57:19.695
ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN HELP TO

02:57:19.762 --> 02:57:21.697
SUPPORT. AND PART OF THAT

02:57:21.764 --> 02:57:24.600
EFFORT HAS TO BE TO EMPOWER THE

02:57:24.667 --> 02:57:27.103
WORKERS THEMSELVES TO BE TO

02:57:27.169 --> 02:57:29.338

02:57:32.808 --> 02:57:33.676
ADDITION TO THE INTERNAL

OVERSIGHT STEPS, BUT THE

02:57:36.512 --> 02:57:41.684
RELEVANT. INCREASE IN CAPACITY

02:57:41.751 --> 02:57:44.987
IS IMPORTANT. IS THERE. WHAT

02:57:45.054 --> 02:57:46.288
ARE YOU DOING TO EXPAND THE

02:57:46.355 --> 02:57:49.558
NETWORKS OF VERIFIERS WHO

02:57:49.625 --> 02:57:51.827
UNDERSTAND THE POLICIES, WHO

02:57:51.894 --> 02:57:53.362
UNDERSTAND THE PROTECTIONS, AND

02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:54.330
ALSO UNDERSTAND THEIR SECTORS

02:57:54.397 --> 02:57:57.967
VERY WELL? WHAT IS THE WHAT ARE

YOU DOING TO PARTNER WITH THEM

02:57:59.101 --> 02:58:04.273
ON THIS? WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. SO

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:06.675
SORRY. WE ARE WORKING WITH

02:58:06.742 --> 02:58:08.144
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:12.548
TO EDUCATE THEM ON RULES AND

02:58:12.615 --> 02:58:14.483
REGULATIONS AS THEY RELATE TO

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:17.420
OSHA. WE'RE SETTING UP

02:58:17.486 --> 02:58:19.288
RELATIONSHIP BUILDINGS,

02:58:19.355 --> 02:58:20.556
MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS DIRECTLY

02:58:20.623 --> 02:58:22.525
WITH OUR ENFORCEMENT TEAM.

02:58:22.591 --> 02:58:24.360
WE'VE WORKED WITH SO-CALLED

02:58:24.427 --> 02:58:26.128
OSHA AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

02:58:26.195 --> 02:58:29.398
AND MEETING AND DISCUSSING AND

02:58:29.465 --> 02:58:31.300
AND THE GOAL THERE IS THAT THEY

02:58:31.367 --> 02:58:33.669
BRING OTHERS TO THOSE MEETINGS

02:58:33.736 --> 02:58:35.171
SO THEY GET TO KNOW OUR

02:58:35.237 --> 02:58:38.374
ENFORCEMENT TEAM. FROM THERE,

02:58:38.441 --> 02:58:40.276
WE EDUCATE THEM ON WAYS OF

02:58:40.342 --> 02:58:43.379
FILING COMPLAINTS, OF

02:58:43.446 --> 02:58:45.614
UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYEES RIGHTS,

02:58:45.681 --> 02:58:46.582
AND WE HELP EDUCATE EMPLOYEES

02:58:46.649 --> 02:58:49.752
ON THOSE RIGHTS AND PRETTY MUCH

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:51.353
ENCOURAGE THEM TO FILE

02:58:51.420 --> 02:58:53.989
COMPLAINTS WITH US ABOUT UNSAFE

02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:55.491
WORK CONDITIONS SO THAT WE CAN

02:58:55.558 --> 02:58:58.294
RESPOND TO THOSE OUT OF, YOU

02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:00.429
KNOW, OUT OF FEAR OF

02:59:00.496 --> 02:59:01.163
RETALIATION. WE EXPLAIN ALL OF

02:59:01.230 --> 02:59:02.398
THAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT ALL THAT

02:59:02.465 --> 02:59:04.333
MEANS AS WELL. BUT MOST

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:06.235
IMPORTANTLY, BY WORKING WITH

02:59:06.302 --> 02:59:08.804
THESE CBOS AND COMMUNITY BASED

02:59:08.871 --> 02:59:10.306
GROUPS, THEY'RE ABLE TO FILE

02:59:10.372 --> 02:59:12.608
COMPLAINTS ON BEHALF AND GIVE

02:59:12.675 --> 02:59:14.743
US MORE INFORMATION SO WE KNOW

02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:16.312
WHERE TO GO. WE ARE ENGAGED IN

02:59:16.378 --> 02:59:18.447
DOING A LOT OF PROACTIVE TYPE

02:59:18.514 --> 02:59:20.282
OF INSPECTIONS, AND THEY'RE

02:59:20.349 --> 02:59:23.385
ABLE TO ASSIST US IN GIVING US

02:59:23.452 --> 02:59:25.387
DIRECTIONS AND AREAS INTO WHERE

02:59:25.454 --> 02:59:27.490
WE NEED TO LOOK INTO. BUT MOST

02:59:27.556 --> 02:59:29.191
IMPORTANTLY, THEY'RE ALSO ABLE

02:59:29.258 --> 02:59:31.527
TO HELP US COMMUNICATE WITH

02:59:31.594 --> 02:59:35.097
WORKERS. AND I AND I APPRECIATE

02:59:35.164 --> 02:59:36.499
THE CBOS AND I APPRECIATE THAT

02:59:36.565 --> 02:59:38.300
NETWORK. I JUST WANT TO STILL

02:59:38.367 --> 02:59:43.439
POINT OUT THAT THE THE WORKERS

02:59:43.506 --> 02:59:46.408
THEMSELVES ARE CRITICAL TO THIS.

02:59:46.475 --> 02:59:49.211
AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE FACT

02:59:49.278 --> 02:59:51.413
THAT WE NEED THAT WE SUPPORT

02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:52.181
ELIMINATING POSITIONS. WE'RE

02:59:52.248 --> 02:59:54.917
NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS AN

02:59:54.984 --> 02:59:56.452
ISSUE OF REPLACING THOSE

02:59:56.519 --> 02:59:58.387
WORKERS WHO ARE WITHIN THE

02:59:58.454 --> 03:00:00.523
AGENCY, BUT IT'S ABOUT BUILDING

03:00:00.589 --> 03:00:04.393
A BIGGER US, A BIGGER US TO BE

03:00:04.460 --> 03:00:06.228
ON THE GROUND AND WHO REALLY

03:00:06.295 --> 03:00:08.197
KNOW AND HAVE INTIMATE

03:00:08.264 --> 03:00:12.268
KNOWLEDGE OF THESE CONDITIONS.

03:00:12.334 --> 03:00:16.205
I, I WANT TO MOVE ON TO MY NEXT

03:00:16.272 --> 03:00:19.475
QUESTION. AND AND THIS WAS AN

03:00:19.542 --> 03:00:21.343
AREA IN THE AUDIT THAT JUST

03:00:21.410 --> 03:00:22.912
HIGHLIGHTED INVALID COMPLAINTS,

03:00:22.978 --> 03:00:25.281
INVALID COMPLAINTS AND, AND

03:00:25.347 --> 03:00:27.316
WHAT WAS DEEMED INVALID

03:00:27.383 --> 03:00:28.484
COMPLAINTS WERE WORKERS WHO

03:00:28.551 --> 03:00:30.419
WERE, YOU KNOW, EXPERIENCING

03:00:30.486 --> 03:00:33.155
SOME HARM ON THE JOB, WHO

03:00:33.222 --> 03:00:35.357
THOUGHT IT WAS A HEALTH AND

03:00:35.424 --> 03:00:36.425
SAFETY ISSUE, BUT IN FACT,

03:00:36.492 --> 03:00:37.393
MAYBE IT WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS

03:00:37.459 --> 03:00:40.296
ISSUE, OR MAYBE IT WAS A WAGE

03:00:40.362 --> 03:00:45.467
ISSUE AND IT WAS UNCLEAR. WHAT

03:00:45.534 --> 03:00:48.270
THE STEPS ARE FOR THOSE KINDS

03:00:48.337 --> 03:00:51.106
OF COMPLAINTS. SO I THINK THE

03:00:51.173 --> 03:00:53.075
AUDIT SAID SOMETHING LIKE THERE

03:00:53.142 --> 03:00:55.778
WERE, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE

03:00:55.844 --> 03:00:58.047
INSTANCES WHERE THE ALLEGATIONS

03:00:58.113 --> 03:01:00.416
WERE JUST UNCLEAR WHERE IT

03:01:00.482 --> 03:01:02.484
SEEMED LIKE MAYBE THE EMPLOYEE

03:01:02.551 --> 03:01:06.855
WAS BEING HARASSED. AND THIS IS

03:01:06.922 --> 03:01:09.024
BY YOUR INVESTIGATORS, BUT

03:01:09.091 --> 03:01:10.292
UNCLEAR WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE

03:01:10.359 --> 03:01:13.128
COMPLAINTS. AND IT SORT OF FROM

03:01:13.195 --> 03:01:15.264
THE AUDIT SEEMED AS IF NOTHING

03:01:15.331 --> 03:01:16.565
WOULD HAPPEN. SO MY QUESTION IS,

03:01:16.632 --> 03:01:18.534
IS THERE ANY FOLLOW UP FOR

03:01:18.601 --> 03:01:19.501
THOSE KINDS OF COMPLAINTS? WHAT

03:01:19.568 --> 03:01:22.705
KIND OF CROSS-AGENCY

03:01:22.771 --> 03:01:23.772
COLLABORATION DO YOU HAVE? DO

03:01:23.839 --> 03:01:25.341
YOU REFER COMPLAINTS OF

03:01:25.407 --> 03:01:27.643
HARASSMENT, PARTICULARLY IF I'M

03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:29.445
INJURED ON THE JOB AND THEN MY

03:01:29.511 --> 03:01:31.113
EMPLOYER RETALIATES AGAINST ME,

03:01:31.180 --> 03:01:33.215
THEN THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF

03:01:33.282 --> 03:01:35.117
VIOLATION WHERE, YOU KNOW,

03:01:35.184 --> 03:01:38.287
WHERE DO YOU ENGAGE WITH, FOR

03:01:38.354 --> 03:01:39.455
EXAMPLE, THE LABOR

03:01:39.521 --> 03:01:40.189
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE? AND CAN

03:01:40.256 --> 03:01:42.491
YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:01:42.558 --> 03:01:44.560
ABOUT THAT? WHEN WE RECEIVE

03:01:44.627 --> 03:01:47.529
COMPLAINTS OF THAT NATURE OR

03:01:47.596 --> 03:01:49.198
OTHER AGENCIES, WE DO REFERRALS

03:01:49.265 --> 03:01:52.368
OVER TO THOSE AGENCIES LIKE AE.

03:01:52.434 --> 03:01:54.303
WE WOULD REFER THOSE. OUR TEAM

03:01:54.370 --> 03:01:56.505
WILL TAKE DOWN THE INFORMATION

03:01:56.572 --> 03:01:59.341
AND THEN DO A FORMAL REFERRAL

03:01:59.408 --> 03:02:02.344
OVER TO AE. ONE OF THE THINGS

03:02:02.411 --> 03:02:03.646
THAT WE'RE ALSO DOING WITH

03:02:03.712 --> 03:02:05.414
AUTOMATION PROJECT THAT WE'RE

03:02:05.481 --> 03:02:08.584
WORKING ON, THAT WOULD HAVE A

03:02:08.651 --> 03:02:09.418
PORTAL WHERE COMPLAINTS OF THAT

03:02:09.485 --> 03:02:11.186
NATURE WOULD BE SENT OVER TO

03:02:11.253 --> 03:02:14.356
OUR SISTER AGENCY. WE DO ALSO

03:02:14.423 --> 03:02:16.091
WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR SISTER

03:02:16.158 --> 03:02:17.526
AGENCY. WE MAY COLLABORATE AND

03:02:17.593 --> 03:02:21.130
DO JOINT INSPECTIONS OF THAT

03:02:21.196 --> 03:02:23.599
NATURE AS WELL. IF WE'RE OUT IN

03:02:23.666 --> 03:02:24.133
THE FIELD AND WE GET

03:02:24.199 --> 03:02:25.634
INFORMATION LIKE THAT, OUR TEAM

03:02:25.701 --> 03:02:28.737
ALSO DOES REFERRALS OVER. WE'RE

03:02:28.804 --> 03:02:29.338
CURRENTLY WORKING TOGETHER TO

03:02:29.405 --> 03:02:32.474
BETTER NETWORK SISTER AGENCIES.

03:02:32.541 --> 03:02:36.679
WE DO ALSO WHAT WE CALL POP UP

03:02:36.745 --> 03:02:38.380
CLINICS, ALONG WITH OUR SISTER

03:02:38.447 --> 03:02:40.249
AGENCIES, AND TAKE COMPLAINTS

03:02:40.316 --> 03:02:41.517
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT

03:02:41.583 --> 03:02:43.152
WE DO REFER AND SEND THE

03:02:43.218 --> 03:02:44.386
INFORMATION OVER TO OUR SISTER

03:02:44.453 --> 03:02:46.722
AGENCY, AND WE'RE WORKING ON A

03:02:46.789 --> 03:02:48.123
WAY THAT WE CAN BOTH SHARE

03:02:48.190 --> 03:02:50.159
INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN

03:02:50.225 --> 03:02:52.728
BETTER INFORM WORKERS ON WHAT'S

03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:54.296
HAPPENING WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS,

03:02:54.363 --> 03:02:57.132
BE IT THAT IT'S A COMPLAINT OR

03:02:57.199 --> 03:02:59.902
COMPLAINT. YEAH. I THINK THOSE

03:02:59.968 --> 03:03:01.503
RIGOROUS COLLABORATIONS ARE

03:03:01.570 --> 03:03:03.339
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN MY

03:03:03.405 --> 03:03:04.640
EXPERIENCE, IF YOU HAVE AN

03:03:04.707 --> 03:03:06.542
EMPLOYER THAT'S VIOLATING

03:03:06.608 --> 03:03:08.610
HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS, THEY

03:03:08.677 --> 03:03:09.712
LIKELY ARE ALSO VIOLATING WAGE

03:03:09.778 --> 03:03:12.214
AND HOUR LAWS, CIVIL RIGHTS

03:03:12.281 --> 03:03:14.383
LAWS IN THE WORKPLACE. SO THAT

03:03:14.450 --> 03:03:15.217
CROSS-COLLABORATION IS IS

03:03:15.284 --> 03:03:17.353
REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I THINK

03:03:17.419 --> 03:03:20.122
THINKING ABOUT A FINE RUBRIC

03:03:20.189 --> 03:03:22.424
THAT HELPS TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS

03:03:22.491 --> 03:03:24.360
THE VARIOUS WAYS THAT WORKERS

03:03:24.426 --> 03:03:25.594
ARE IMPACTED IS CRITICALLY

03:03:25.661 --> 03:03:27.463
IMPORTANT. AGAIN, GOING BACK TO

03:03:27.529 --> 03:03:29.565
THIS QUESTION OF WHY ARE WE

03:03:29.631 --> 03:03:32.067
BRINGING IN LESS IN OUR

03:03:32.134 --> 03:03:34.536
PENALTIES AND FINES THAN OTHER

03:03:34.603 --> 03:03:36.505
OTHER STATES? WHY? WHY ARE OUR

03:03:36.572 --> 03:03:38.374
FINES SO LOW? THIS IS ANOTHER

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:41.510
WAY. AGAIN, YOU GET FOLKS PAY

03:03:41.577 --> 03:03:43.712
ATTENTION WHEN THEY'RE HIT IN

03:03:43.779 --> 03:03:45.481
THE POCKET, AND THAT IS HOW WE

03:03:45.547 --> 03:03:47.649
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

03:03:47.716 --> 03:03:49.451
USING ALL THAT WE CAN TO ASSESS

03:03:49.518 --> 03:03:51.186
FINES AND PENALTIES, AND TO DO

03:03:51.253 --> 03:03:52.554
IT IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY, SO

03:03:52.621 --> 03:03:54.423
THAT WE CAN REALLY ISOLATE BAD

03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:56.759
ACTORS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY

03:03:56.825 --> 03:03:59.428
ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. MY, MY,

03:03:59.495 --> 03:04:01.730
MY NEXT. AND I HAVE MANY

03:04:01.797 --> 03:04:06.201
QUESTIONS, BUT MY AND I WILL.

03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:08.404
HOPEFULLY WILL GET THROUGH THEM.

03:04:08.470 --> 03:04:10.339
BUT MY MY MY MY NEXT QUESTION

03:04:10.406 --> 03:04:15.244
HAS TO DO WITH CALLIE JAR. AND

03:04:15.310 --> 03:04:19.281
IT SEEMS THERE ARE SOME

03:04:19.348 --> 03:04:21.917
PROBLEMS IN THE HIRING PROCESS,

03:04:21.984 --> 03:04:24.386
AND THAT THERE SIMPLY ALSO ARE

03:04:24.453 --> 03:04:25.587
NOT ENOUGH POSITIONS, THAT

03:04:25.654 --> 03:04:27.256
THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE AUDIT

03:04:27.322 --> 03:04:30.893
IS TELLING US. I THINK THERE

03:04:30.959 --> 03:04:33.862
WAS MENTIONED SOME. I WANTED

03:04:33.929 --> 03:04:35.097
YOU TO CLARIFY YOUR STATEMENT

03:04:35.164 --> 03:04:37.232
ABOUT WHAT CAL HR IS DOING TO

03:04:37.299 --> 03:04:39.334
ASSIST IN THIS PROCESS. I KNOW

03:04:39.401 --> 03:04:41.403
WHEN WE HAD OUR AUDIT AROUND

03:04:41.470 --> 03:04:43.505
SOME OF OUR WAGE ENFORCEMENT

03:04:43.572 --> 03:04:46.275
WORK, AND WE WERE ABLE THIS

03:04:46.341 --> 03:04:48.877
LEGISLATURE TO EXPEDITE

03:04:48.944 --> 03:04:51.280
EMERGENCY HIRING THAT CAL HR

03:04:51.346 --> 03:04:54.216
AND HIRING PROCESS TOOK SO LONG

03:04:54.283 --> 03:04:56.452
THAT THE ALMOST THE EMERGENCY

03:04:56.518 --> 03:04:58.587
ORDER WAS NEARLY UP BY THE TIME

03:04:58.654 --> 03:05:01.924
WE FULLY BROUGHT THOSE HIRES

03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:04.193
ONLINE. WHAT IS THE PROCESS

03:05:04.259 --> 03:05:06.495
THAT CAL HR IS DOING? HOW ARE

03:05:06.562 --> 03:05:09.264
YOU? HOW IS HR WORKING WITH THE

03:05:09.331 --> 03:05:15.370
AGENCY TO ADDRESS THESE HIRING

03:05:15.437 --> 03:05:19.308
NEEDS, AND WHAT ARE THE

03:05:19.374 --> 03:05:21.310
BENCHMARKS THAT ARE BEING PUT

03:05:21.376 --> 03:05:23.712
IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:05:23.779 --> 03:05:24.446
ARE BRINGING, PARTICULARLY ON

03:05:24.513 --> 03:05:25.347
THE INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST SIDE

03:05:25.414 --> 03:05:28.450
OF THE TABLE, THAT WE ARE

03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:32.287
ACCELERATING THOSE FRONT LINE.

03:05:57.579 --> 03:06:00.716
A CONTRACT WITH A VENDOR TO DO

03:06:00.782 --> 03:06:01.216

03:06:29.745 --> 03:06:31.813
OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'RE WORKING

03:06:31.880 --> 03:06:34.216
ON. I DO NOT HAVE A TIMELINE OR

BENCHMARK FOR THEIR STUDY

03:06:35.417 --> 03:06:38.186
OUTSIDE OF. WE HAVE BEEN

03:06:38.253 --> 03:06:41.390
ENGAGED WITH THE AUDITOR, THE

03:06:41.456 --> 03:06:42.357
PRIVATE CONSULTANT THAT'S

03:06:42.424 --> 03:06:45.661
AUDITING THE INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE

03:06:45.727 --> 03:06:48.363
CLASSIFICATION. WE AND AND THE

03:06:48.430 --> 03:06:50.432
DUE DATE FOR THE REPORT TO BE

03:06:50.499 --> 03:06:53.535
RELEASED BY CAL H.R. I'M SORRY,

03:06:53.602 --> 03:06:55.637
THE DUE DATE IS THEY ARE

03:06:55.704 --> 03:06:58.040
SUPPOSED TO RELEASE THE REPORT

03:06:58.106 --> 03:07:01.944
DECEMBER 31ST, 2026. OKAY. ALL

03:07:02.010 --> 03:07:06.615
RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW, I. I

03:07:06.682 --> 03:07:11.687
KNOW, MISS LEE. I WAS A PART OF

03:07:11.753 --> 03:07:13.355
KNOWING ABOUT YOUR APPOINTMENT

03:07:13.422 --> 03:07:17.392
IN 2024 AND YOUR CONFIRMATION

03:07:17.459 --> 03:07:19.127
EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND

03:07:19.194 --> 03:07:22.397
CERTAINLY THESE ARE DEEPLY

03:07:22.464 --> 03:07:24.600
ENTRENCHED CHALLENGES THAT HAVE

03:07:24.666 --> 03:07:27.836
EXISTED FAR BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.

03:07:27.903 --> 03:07:30.439
BUT NOW YOU ARE ON THE HOOK FOR

03:07:30.505 --> 03:07:31.640
MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET

03:07:31.707 --> 03:07:34.543
ADDRESSED. AND I APPRECIATED

03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:41.183
OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY. I

03:07:41.249 --> 03:07:43.418
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE

03:07:43.485 --> 03:07:45.087
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN STAYING IN

03:07:45.153 --> 03:07:47.889
CONTACT WITH YOU TO ENSURE THAT

03:07:47.956 --> 03:07:50.058
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS, THE ONES

03:07:50.125 --> 03:07:51.760
THAT ARE COMING IN SEPTEMBER

03:07:51.827 --> 03:07:53.629
FROM, YOU KNOW, THE UPDATED

03:07:53.695 --> 03:07:55.364
LOOK BY OUR AUDITOR, BUT ALSO

03:07:55.430 --> 03:07:57.399
THE INTERNAL FINDINGS. AND I

03:07:57.466 --> 03:08:00.202
HOPE AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS

03:08:00.268 --> 03:08:02.204
IS THE PROCESS, BUT THAT THEY

03:08:02.270 --> 03:08:04.139
WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OUR

03:08:04.206 --> 03:08:06.808
OFFICES IN REAL TIME SO THAT WE

03:08:06.875 --> 03:08:10.946
CAN CONTINUE TO TRACK. THESE

03:08:11.013 --> 03:08:13.315
ARE THIS IS THE AGENCY WHERE IT

03:08:13.382 --> 03:08:16.418
IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.

03:08:16.485 --> 03:08:18.687
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO TREAT IT

03:08:18.754 --> 03:08:22.290
AS SUCH. AND LOOKING FORWARD TO

03:08:22.357 --> 03:08:24.726
YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

03:08:24.793 --> 03:08:26.161
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ALL THAT

03:08:26.228 --> 03:08:28.430
YOU HAVE LAID OUT HERE IN TERMS

03:08:28.497 --> 03:08:30.265
OF THE STEPS THAT YOU ARE GOING

03:08:30.332 --> 03:08:32.234
TO TAKE TO ENSURE THAT THIS

03:08:32.300 --> 03:08:33.669
AGENCY MOVES THE NEEDLE ON

03:08:33.735 --> 03:08:35.504
THESE CONDITIONS AND CONCERNS

03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:36.371
AND REALLY PROTECT THE WORKERS

03:08:36.438 --> 03:08:39.307
OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU, MADAM

03:08:39.374 --> 03:08:41.510
CHAIR. AND JUST A TIME CHECK. I

03:08:41.576 --> 03:08:43.111
KNOW THREE OF MY COLLEAGUES

03:08:43.178 --> 03:08:44.212
STILL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THIS

03:08:44.279 --> 03:08:45.647
PANEL. WE STILL HAVE OUR LAST

03:08:45.714 --> 03:08:47.149
PANEL. SO WE WILL GO TO

03:08:47.215 --> 03:08:48.283
ASSEMBLY MEMBER KARL ROVE AND

03:08:48.350 --> 03:08:49.584
SENATOR CORTEZ AND

03:08:49.651 --> 03:08:51.386
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RANSOM. BUT I DO

03:08:51.453 --> 03:08:53.522
WANT TO GET US OUT OF HERE BY

03:08:53.588 --> 03:08:55.691
ONE IF WE CAN. SO THANK YOU FOR

03:08:55.757 --> 03:08:56.491
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION. THANK YOU,

03:08:56.558 --> 03:08:57.259
MR. CHAIR, AND THANK YOU TO MY

03:08:57.325 --> 03:09:00.595
COLLEAGUES FOR ASKING GREAT

03:09:00.662 --> 03:09:04.332
QUESTIONS AND TO THE DIRECTOR

03:09:04.399 --> 03:09:06.134
AND CHIEF. I KNOW THE DIRECTOR

03:09:06.201 --> 03:09:07.335
JUST JOINED THREE WEEKS AGO,

03:09:07.402 --> 03:09:08.537
THE CHIEF JUST LAST YEAR. AND

03:09:08.603 --> 03:09:10.739
THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE IS

03:09:10.806 --> 03:09:11.339
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TURNOVER

03:09:11.406 --> 03:09:13.275
IN THOSE POSITIONS, AND IT'S

03:09:13.341 --> 03:09:14.443
HARD TO ACTUALLY HAVE

03:09:14.509 --> 03:09:16.445
TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE. I DO

03:09:16.511 --> 03:09:18.480
APPRECIATE CHIEF LEE COMING IN.

03:09:18.547 --> 03:09:20.248
AND WITHIN A MATTER, I MEAN,

03:09:20.315 --> 03:09:22.350
THIS IS JUST LIKE I THINK WE'RE

03:09:22.417 --> 03:09:23.585
BASICALLY 14 MONTHS INTO YOUR

03:09:23.652 --> 03:09:25.187
ROLE AND COMING IN AND

03:09:25.253 --> 03:09:27.389
RECOGNIZING HIRING WAS A MAJOR

03:09:27.456 --> 03:09:29.491
ISSUE IN GETTING THAT MOVING IN

03:09:29.558 --> 03:09:32.027
JANUARY. I ALSO DO APPRECIATE

03:09:32.094 --> 03:09:34.529
RECOGNITION OF THE THE

03:09:34.596 --> 03:09:36.331
AUDITOR'S CONCLUSIONS AND

03:09:36.398 --> 03:09:37.466
RECOMMENDATIONS. WE DON'T

03:09:37.532 --> 03:09:39.401
ALWAYS GET THAT WHEN WE HAVE

03:09:39.468 --> 03:09:41.937
THESE TYPES OF HEARINGS. THE VÆ

03:09:42.003 --> 03:09:44.272
IS OFTENTIMES MORE PUSHBACK.

03:09:44.339 --> 03:09:46.441
AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THOSE

03:09:46.508 --> 03:09:46.975
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING

03:09:47.042 --> 03:09:48.643
WORKED ON NOW. I THINK IT'S

03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:50.445
QUITE CLEAR THAT COME JANUARY,

03:09:50.512 --> 03:09:52.247
FOR THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS,

03:09:52.314 --> 03:09:54.583
PARTICULARLY ON THE POLICY SIDE,

03:09:54.649 --> 03:09:56.351
THAT AREN'T, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE

03:09:56.418 --> 03:09:58.754
HAVE A CHANCE TO GO LOOK AT

03:09:58.820 --> 03:09:59.654
THEM AND AREN'T SATISFIED AT

03:09:59.721 --> 03:10:01.156
THE POSITION WE'RE IN, THERE

03:10:01.223 --> 03:10:02.390
WILL BE LEGISLATION, I THINK,

03:10:02.457 --> 03:10:04.826
QUITE CLEARLY THAT WILL HELP TO

03:10:04.893 --> 03:10:06.261
SPUR SOME OF THAT. AND AS IT

03:10:06.328 --> 03:10:09.197
APPLIES TO HR, I THINK

03:10:09.264 --> 03:10:11.233
CERTAINLY THAT'S AN AREA WHERE

03:10:11.299 --> 03:10:13.401
I THINK YOU'LL GET SUPPORT FROM

03:10:13.468 --> 03:10:15.237
FOLKS TO HELP PUSH ALONG WHEN

03:10:15.303 --> 03:10:16.571
IT COMES TO HIRING AND

03:10:16.638 --> 03:10:18.473
RETENTION, WHICH I THINK IS A

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:19.474
BIG ISSUE, THAT OFTENTIMES

03:10:19.541 --> 03:10:22.144
THERE'S HIRING SPURTS AND THEN

03:10:22.210 --> 03:10:23.478
DIPS BECAUSE THE RETENTION IS

03:10:23.545 --> 03:10:25.547
THE BIG ISSUE. AND SO ENSURING

03:10:25.614 --> 03:10:27.082
THAT NOT ONLY WE CAN HIRE

03:10:27.149 --> 03:10:28.416
QUALITY FOLKS, ESPECIALLY ON

03:10:28.483 --> 03:10:30.685
THE FRONT LINE INDUSTRIAL

03:10:30.752 --> 03:10:31.553
HYGIENISTS AND SUCH, BUT CAN

03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:34.656
KEEP THEM FOR THE LONG TERM.

03:10:34.723 --> 03:10:39.861
AND THE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION

03:10:39.928 --> 03:10:42.430
ON THE LETTERS AND KIND OF

03:10:42.497 --> 03:10:44.633
FOLLOWING UP ON CHAIR SMALLWOOD

03:10:44.699 --> 03:10:46.401
CUEVAS'S POINT, IN TERMS OF

03:10:46.468 --> 03:10:48.336
COLLABORATION, I KNOW THAT LA,

03:10:48.403 --> 03:10:50.172
I KNOW IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY,

03:10:50.238 --> 03:10:52.507
WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST OFFICE OF

03:10:52.574 --> 03:10:56.244
LABOR ENFORCEMENT. WHEN THESE

03:10:56.311 --> 03:10:58.113
LETTERS ARE SENT OUT, IS THERE

03:10:58.180 --> 03:10:59.314
COMMUNICATION WITH EITHER THOSE

03:10:59.381 --> 03:11:01.383
OFFICES OR OR CIVIL PROSECUTORS,

03:11:01.449 --> 03:11:03.485
COUNTY COUNCILS, WHAT HAVE YOU?

03:11:03.552 --> 03:11:04.319
DOES THAT COMMUNICATION OCCUR?

03:11:04.386 --> 03:11:06.621
OR JUST LIKE AT LEAST SENT OVER

03:11:06.688 --> 03:11:09.324
THERE? AND IF NOT, CAN THAT BE

03:11:09.391 --> 03:11:10.525
PART OF A NEW POLICY OR

03:11:10.592 --> 03:11:12.661
CONSIDERED AS A NEW POLICY TO

03:11:12.727 --> 03:11:14.396
SEND THAT INFORMATION TO LOCAL

03:11:14.462 --> 03:11:16.331
AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING SIMILAR

03:11:16.398 --> 03:11:23.605
WORK? I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE

03:11:23.672 --> 03:11:24.439
CLEAR ON YOUR QUESTION. IF YOU

03:11:24.506 --> 03:11:27.275
COULD. WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, CAL

03:11:27.342 --> 03:11:29.945
OSHA AND THIS IS LOOKING FROM

03:11:30.011 --> 03:11:31.246
THE DOCUMENTATION OR THE INFO

03:11:31.313 --> 03:11:34.449
YOU PROVIDED US ON PAGE 16,

03:11:34.516 --> 03:11:35.217
UPON RECEIVING THE LETTER,

03:11:35.283 --> 03:11:36.451
EMPLOYER MUST DO CERTAIN THINGS,

03:11:36.518 --> 03:11:38.286
POST A LETTER IN THE WORKPLACE,

03:11:38.353 --> 03:11:40.288
RESPOND TO CAL OSHA. WELL, IF

03:11:40.355 --> 03:11:42.357
NO ONE'S GOING TO THE WORKSITE,

03:11:42.424 --> 03:11:43.325
HOW DO WE KNOW THEY'RE POSTING

03:11:43.391 --> 03:11:45.293
THAT LETTER? HOW DO WE KNOW THE

03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:46.461
WORKERS ARE INFORMED? AND I

03:11:46.528 --> 03:11:48.029
KNOW THAT, AGAIN, STAFFING

03:11:48.096 --> 03:11:48.663
ISSUES, YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE

03:11:48.730 --> 03:11:50.465
GO TO EVERY SITE WHERE A LETTER

03:11:50.532 --> 03:11:52.200
IS SUPPOSED TO BE POSTED. BUT

03:11:52.267 --> 03:11:53.401
THERE ARE LOCAL COUNTY AGENCIES

03:11:53.468 --> 03:11:55.437
THAT MAY HAVE FOLKS THAT CAN GO

03:11:55.503 --> 03:11:57.339
ON BY AND SEE IF THAT'S BEING

03:11:57.405 --> 03:11:59.274
COMPLIED WITH. IS THAT

03:11:59.341 --> 03:12:00.775
SOMETHING THAT, IF NOT

03:12:00.842 --> 03:12:01.943
CONSIDERED, WOULD BE SOMETHING

03:12:02.010 --> 03:12:04.012
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED IN

03:12:04.079 --> 03:12:04.746
TERMS OF CREATING THAT

03:12:04.813 --> 03:12:07.148
COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT? I

03:12:07.215 --> 03:12:09.551
THINK I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

03:12:09.618 --> 03:12:11.253
THAT WE COULD LOOK INTO AND

03:12:11.319 --> 03:12:13.688
CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU. DO WE

03:12:13.755 --> 03:12:15.090
NEED TO? I WOULD APPRECIATE

03:12:15.156 --> 03:12:17.959
THAT. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,

03:12:18.026 --> 03:12:20.161
AGAIN, WE KNOW THAT IN MANY

03:12:20.228 --> 03:12:21.496
WAYS WHEN IT COMES TO STANDING

03:12:21.563 --> 03:12:23.531
UP FOR OUR WORKERS THAT WERE

03:12:23.598 --> 03:12:25.267
OUTGUNNED IN MANY WAYS, THERE

03:12:25.333 --> 03:12:27.702
ARE SO MANY BUSINESSES. AND

03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:29.237
QUITE FRANKLY, WHEN WHEN YOU

03:12:29.304 --> 03:12:30.505
HAVE BUSINESSES THAT VIOLATE

03:12:30.572 --> 03:12:32.474
THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS, IT'S A

03:12:32.540 --> 03:12:33.141
DISADVANTAGE TO RESPONSIBLE

03:12:33.208 --> 03:12:34.376
BUSINESSES TOO. SO THIS IS NOT

03:12:34.442 --> 03:12:36.411
JUST THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT

03:12:36.478 --> 03:12:37.846
THE WORKERS, BUT IT'S ALSO

03:12:37.913 --> 03:12:38.413
ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE A

03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:39.547
COMPETITIVE PLAYING FIELD FOR

03:12:39.614 --> 03:12:41.516
THOSE RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYERS

03:12:41.583 --> 03:12:43.718
THAT ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING,

03:12:43.785 --> 03:12:45.854
THAT ARE ENSURING THEY HAVE A

03:12:45.921 --> 03:12:48.323
SAFE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. SO

03:12:48.390 --> 03:12:50.325
I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME

03:12:50.392 --> 03:12:52.160
THOUGHTS ON WORKING WITH THOSE

03:12:52.227 --> 03:12:54.663
LOCAL THOSE COUNTY OFFICES OF

03:12:54.729 --> 03:12:56.164
LABOR ENFORCEMENT, COUNTY

03:12:56.231 --> 03:12:58.667
COUNCILS, WHAT HAVE YOU, IN

03:12:58.733 --> 03:13:00.101
ORDER TO AGAIN INCREASE THE

03:13:00.168 --> 03:13:01.236
ARMY OF FOLKS THAT WE

03:13:01.303 --> 03:13:05.073
POTENTIALLY HAVE OF GETTING OUT

03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:07.409
INTO THE COMMUNITY, IF IT'S A

03:13:07.475 --> 03:13:09.177
PLACE THAT DOES HAVE

03:13:09.244 --> 03:13:12.681
REPRESENTATION, I BY A UNION,

03:13:12.747 --> 03:13:15.450
ARE THEY INFORMED WHEN THERE'S

03:13:15.517 --> 03:13:18.119
A LETTER BEING SENT OUT OR A

03:13:18.186 --> 03:13:21.523
VIOLATION? THIS IS SOMETHING

03:13:21.589 --> 03:13:23.091
ELSE THAT WE WERE THINKING

03:13:23.158 --> 03:13:25.460
ABOUT ALSO. SO WE CAN CIRCLE

03:13:25.527 --> 03:13:27.262
BACK TO YOU ON THE UNION ASPECT.

03:13:27.329 --> 03:13:28.363
I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY

03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:30.365
HELPFUL. AGAIN, INCREASING THE

03:13:30.432 --> 03:13:32.867
BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO ENSURE

03:13:32.934 --> 03:13:35.570
THAT NOT ONLY LETTERS ARE

03:13:35.637 --> 03:13:37.505
POSTED, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

03:13:37.572 --> 03:13:38.640
CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TAKEN AS

03:13:38.707 --> 03:13:40.642
THE EMPLOYER IS ENSURING WHEN

03:13:40.709 --> 03:13:43.378
THEY DO THAT RESPONSE SO THAT

03:13:43.445 --> 03:13:45.080
IF IT'S FOUND NOT TO BE THE

03:13:45.146 --> 03:13:47.282
CASE, THEN YOU CAN SEND SOMEONE

03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:48.483
THERE. BECAUSE I GET YOU CAN'T

03:13:48.550 --> 03:13:49.384
SEND SOMEONE TO EVERY PLACE

03:13:49.451 --> 03:13:51.619
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LETTER, BUT

03:13:51.686 --> 03:13:52.554
YOU CAN IF YOU GET FEEDBACK

03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:53.688
THAT, HEY, THEY'RE NOT DOING

03:13:53.755 --> 03:13:55.256
WHAT THE EMPLOYER IS NOT

03:13:55.323 --> 03:13:56.391
ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THEY SAID

03:13:56.458 --> 03:13:57.559
THEY'RE DOING, AND THAT COULD

03:13:57.625 --> 03:13:59.194
BE A TRIGGER TO ACTUALLY THEN

03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:00.729
SENDING SOMEONE ON THE GROUND

03:14:00.795 --> 03:14:04.199
OVER THERE. WHEN IT COMES TO.

03:14:04.265 --> 03:14:05.900
AND THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS

03:14:05.967 --> 03:14:07.469
ABOUT THE FINES AND MENTION OF

03:14:07.535 --> 03:14:08.403
TITLE EIGHT, WHAT HAVE YOU. I

03:14:08.470 --> 03:14:09.537
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

03:14:09.604 --> 03:14:11.506
CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE IN THAT

03:14:11.573 --> 03:14:13.174
ARE IN CODE, PRIOR LEGISLATION

03:14:13.241 --> 03:14:15.377
THAT YOU'RE SOMEWHAT BOUND BY.

03:14:15.443 --> 03:14:17.345
I THINK THAT WHAT POLICY WOULD

03:14:17.412 --> 03:14:20.081
BE HELPFUL IS PUTTING CRITERION

03:14:20.148 --> 03:14:23.318
AS TO OKAY, WELL, TITLE EIGHT

03:14:23.385 --> 03:14:24.486
ALLOWS THIS RANGE OF FINES, IT

03:14:24.552 --> 03:14:25.420
ALLOWS FOR REDUCTION OF FINES,

03:14:25.487 --> 03:14:27.288
WHAT HAVE YOU I THINK QUITE

03:14:27.355 --> 03:14:29.557
CLEAR CRITERION AS TO WHAT

03:14:29.624 --> 03:14:31.326
DISCRETION IS GIVEN TO YOUR

03:14:31.393 --> 03:14:33.461
FOLKS. TO ACTUALLY AGREE TO

03:14:33.528 --> 03:14:36.197
SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS TO AGREE TO

03:14:36.264 --> 03:14:40.168
REDUCTIONS. AND IF IT'S IT

03:14:40.235 --> 03:14:41.469
SEEMS LIKE IT'S BEEN VERY LOOSE.

03:14:41.536 --> 03:14:43.772
THAT'S WHAT THE YOU KNOW, THE

03:14:43.838 --> 03:14:44.305
AUDIT HAS INDICATED YOU'VE

03:14:44.372 --> 03:14:46.441
AGREED WITH THAT. SO I'D BE

03:14:46.508 --> 03:14:48.109
VERY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT

03:14:48.176 --> 03:14:50.011
WHAT POLICIES ARE PUT IN PLACE

03:14:50.078 --> 03:14:51.679
TO PUT GUARDRAILS ON THAT. AND

03:14:51.746 --> 03:14:53.214
TO THE OTHER POINT WHICH HAS

03:14:53.281 --> 03:14:54.382
BEEN RAISED BY SEVERAL

03:14:54.449 --> 03:14:55.583
COLLEAGUES, IS THE THE WORKERS

03:14:55.650 --> 03:14:57.318
VOICE. AND SO AT THESE HEARINGS,

03:14:57.385 --> 03:14:59.954
ARE THEY JUST A PUBLIC COMMENT

03:15:00.021 --> 03:15:01.389
OR ARE THEY JUST PUBLIC

03:15:01.456 --> 03:15:02.190
PARTICIPANTS THAT JUST HAVE TO

03:15:02.257 --> 03:15:03.491
SIT THERE AND KIND OF WATCH

03:15:03.558 --> 03:15:05.427
WHAT'S BEING DISCLOSED PUBLICLY,

03:15:05.493 --> 03:15:07.262
OR IS THERE A MORE FORMAL ROLE?

03:15:07.328 --> 03:15:08.530
AND IF NOT, THAT COULD BE

03:15:08.596 --> 03:15:10.765
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE ALSO

03:15:10.832 --> 03:15:11.599
CONTEMPLATED THROUGH

03:15:11.666 --> 03:15:13.268
LEGISLATION, IF NOT THROUGH

03:15:13.334 --> 03:15:15.203
POLICY, TO HAVE A MORE FORMAL

03:15:15.270 --> 03:15:18.339
ROLE OF WORKERS AT THOSE AT

03:15:18.406 --> 03:15:21.342
THOSE WORK SITES, TO HAVE THEIR

03:15:21.409 --> 03:15:23.411
VOICE BEING HEARD BEFORE

03:15:23.478 --> 03:15:25.814
THERE'S AN AGREED UPON

03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:26.881
REDUCTION IN SETTLEMENT OR

03:15:26.948 --> 03:15:30.285
CORRECTIVE ACTION, AND I'LL

03:15:30.351 --> 03:15:32.087
LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW TO

03:15:32.153 --> 03:15:33.455
ALLOW FOR MORE TIME FOR

03:15:33.521 --> 03:15:34.622
COLLEAGUES. BUT AGAIN,

03:15:34.689 --> 03:15:36.758
APPRECIATE YOUR FOLLOW UP AND

03:15:36.825 --> 03:15:37.592
FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME OF THE

03:15:37.659 --> 03:15:39.527
COMMENTS MADE BY MYSELF AND

03:15:39.594 --> 03:15:42.130
COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU, SENATOR

CORTEZ. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

JUST A COUPLE JUST A COUPLE OF

03:15:48.303 --> 03:15:50.772
THINGS I WANTED TO INQUIRE

03:15:50.839 --> 03:15:55.143
ABOUT. GOING. FIRST OF ALL, I

03:15:55.210 --> 03:15:57.612
WANT TO COMMEND ASSEMBLYMEMBER

03:15:57.679 --> 03:15:59.447
ORTEGA FOR INITIATING SO MUCH

03:15:59.514 --> 03:16:01.416
OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN

03:16:01.483 --> 03:16:02.383
ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE LAST

03:16:02.450 --> 03:16:04.352
COUPLE OF YEARS. AND I KNOW,

03:16:04.419 --> 03:16:05.253
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL A LOT

03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:07.322
OF WORK TO DO. AND I

03:16:07.388 --> 03:16:08.490
PARTICIPATED IN ONE OF THE

03:16:08.556 --> 03:16:11.259
INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS GOING

03:16:11.326 --> 03:16:13.528
BACK OVER A YEAR AGO THAT

03:16:13.595 --> 03:16:16.297
FOCUSED ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

03:16:16.364 --> 03:16:19.200
OVER TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS

03:16:19.267 --> 03:16:20.502
STILL SERVING AS A LABOR CHAIR

03:16:20.568 --> 03:16:22.570
IN THE SENATE. AT THE TIME,

03:16:22.637 --> 03:16:25.406
SENATOR HURTADO, OUR OUR SENATE

03:16:25.473 --> 03:16:28.176
AGRICULTURAL CHAIR, AND I. HELD

03:16:28.243 --> 03:16:33.181
A DE FACTO VIRTUAL HEARING.

03:16:33.248 --> 03:16:34.582
THERE WERE STILL CONCERNS ABOUT

03:16:34.649 --> 03:16:37.218
COVID AT THE TIME, AND WE

03:16:37.285 --> 03:16:39.354
COULDN'T REALLY SET UP A

03:16:39.420 --> 03:16:42.223
HEARING HERE IN THE BUILDING OR

03:16:42.290 --> 03:16:45.260
ACROSS THE STREET. AND MANY

03:16:45.326 --> 03:16:46.327
THANKS TO OSHA FOR

03:16:46.394 --> 03:16:48.396
PARTICIPATING IN THAT HEARING.

03:16:48.463 --> 03:16:49.597
AND AND REALLY, I THOUGHT

03:16:49.664 --> 03:16:54.369
GIVING, PROVIDING VERY CANDID,

03:16:54.435 --> 03:16:56.204
WHAT SEEMED TO BE HONEST

03:16:56.271 --> 03:16:57.205
TESTIMONY, YOU KNOW, WITH

03:16:57.272 --> 03:17:01.276
REGARD TO. FOLLOW UP ON

03:17:01.342 --> 03:17:02.310
COMPLAINTS, YOU KNOW, OBSTACLES

03:17:02.377 --> 03:17:04.512
THAT WERE WERE GETTING IN THE

03:17:04.579 --> 03:17:06.514
WAY. YOU KNOW, MUCH LIKE WE'RE

03:17:06.581 --> 03:17:10.652
SEEING HERE, WE REALLY

03:17:10.718 --> 03:17:12.120
INITIATED THAT BECAUSE OF

03:17:12.187 --> 03:17:13.955
COMPLAINTS THAT WERE COMING

03:17:14.022 --> 03:17:17.125
FROM, YOU KNOW, PERMITTED

03:17:17.192 --> 03:17:18.560
CANNABIS GROWS, COMMERCIAL

03:17:18.626 --> 03:17:21.696
CANNABIS GROWS, AND COMPLAINTS

03:17:21.763 --> 03:17:26.167
ABOUT WORKFORCE VIOLATIONS,

03:17:26.234 --> 03:17:28.303
ALLEGED OSHA VIOLATIONS THAT

03:17:28.369 --> 03:17:30.205
WEREN'T BEING FOLLOWED UP THERE.

03:17:30.271 --> 03:17:32.307
AND BASICALLY, THE UPSHOT OF OF

03:17:32.373 --> 03:17:37.679
THAT DISCUSSION WAS THAT A

03:17:37.745 --> 03:17:38.479
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THEM

03:17:38.546 --> 03:17:40.215
WEREN'T BEING FOLLOWED UP ON,

03:17:40.281 --> 03:17:43.384
PARTICULARLY ON A TIMELY BASIS.

03:17:43.451 --> 03:17:45.520
I SHOULD SAY, PARENTHETICALLY,

03:17:45.587 --> 03:17:47.555
THAT THAT THAT DISCUSSION

03:17:47.622 --> 03:17:49.324
MORPHED INTO A LITTLE BIT OF A

03:17:49.390 --> 03:17:50.925
LARGER DISCUSSION ABOUT

03:17:50.992 --> 03:17:53.461
AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN GENERAL,

03:17:53.528 --> 03:17:54.429
BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME COMMON

03:17:54.495 --> 03:17:56.431
THEMES THERE, SOME OVERLAPPING

03:17:56.497 --> 03:17:58.366
THEMES, AS I RECALL. AND ONE OF

03:17:58.433 --> 03:18:01.436
THEM WAS SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT

03:18:01.502 --> 03:18:02.670
REALLY SEEING CALLED OUT IN THE

03:18:02.737 --> 03:18:04.706
AUDIT, BUT MAYBE THE AUDITOR

03:18:04.772 --> 03:18:05.607
TOOK A LOOK AT IT. PROBABLY

03:18:05.673 --> 03:18:07.242
ANYONE ON THE PANEL HERE WOULD

03:18:07.308 --> 03:18:09.310
KNOW IF THAT WAS THE CASE OR

03:18:09.377 --> 03:18:11.479
NOT. AND IT'S IT WASN'T

03:18:11.546 --> 03:18:14.449
NONRESPONSIVE EMPLOYERS. IT WAS

03:18:14.515 --> 03:18:16.584
NONRESPONSIVE COMPLAINANTS. IT

03:18:16.651 --> 03:18:18.553
WAS COMPLAINANTS WHO HAD FILED

03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:22.991
A COMPLAINT. BUT IT TOOK WELL,

03:18:23.057 --> 03:18:25.159
I SHOULDN'T I SHOULDN'T SPEAK

03:18:25.226 --> 03:18:27.495
TO WHAT THE CAUSE WAS, BUT BY

03:18:27.562 --> 03:18:30.331
THE TIME THERE WAS FOLLOW UP TO

03:18:30.398 --> 03:18:34.269
THE COMPLAINT, EITHER THE

03:18:34.335 --> 03:18:36.471
EMPLOYEE COULD WAS NO LONGER

03:18:36.537 --> 03:18:39.607
EMPLOYED THERE OR THE EMPLOYEE

03:18:39.674 --> 03:18:43.578
INDICATED IN VERY SIMPLE TERMS

03:18:43.645 --> 03:18:45.046
THAT THEY NO LONGER WISH TO

03:18:45.113 --> 03:18:47.248
PURSUE THE COMPLAINT. AND THAT

03:18:47.315 --> 03:18:50.385
GAVE RISE TO A BIG DISCUSSION

03:18:50.451 --> 03:18:53.187
WHICH OSHA STAFF PARTICIPATED

03:18:53.254 --> 03:18:55.490
IN AND DID NOT SEEM TO

03:18:55.556 --> 03:18:56.958
CONTRADICT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

03:18:57.025 --> 03:18:59.761
FOR RETALIATION. OR WE HAVE

03:18:59.827 --> 03:19:01.829
LARGE NUMBERS OF UNDOCUMENTED

03:19:01.896 --> 03:19:06.200
WORKERS, SOMETIMES OVER 40%, IN

03:19:06.267 --> 03:19:08.369
THESE AGRICULTURAL SETTINGS,

03:19:08.436 --> 03:19:11.606
THAT THAT FOLKS ARE BEING

03:19:11.673 --> 03:19:12.807
THREATENED AND BOYS ARE BEING

03:19:12.874 --> 03:19:15.276
THREATENED, THAT IF THEY

03:19:15.343 --> 03:19:16.444
CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE

03:19:16.511 --> 03:19:19.480
COMPLAINT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A

03:19:19.547 --> 03:19:23.117
JOB. AND AND OF COURSE, WE'VE

03:19:23.184 --> 03:19:25.386
HEARD THAT FROM UNIONS THAT

03:19:25.453 --> 03:19:28.623
REPRESENT EMPLOYEES, UFW,

03:19:28.690 --> 03:19:32.126
UNITED FARM WORKERS AND OTHERS

03:19:32.193 --> 03:19:35.396
THAT THAT THEY HEAR THAT I'VE

03:19:35.463 --> 03:19:38.566
HEARD IT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

03:19:38.633 --> 03:19:41.436
FROM CLERGY WHO HAVE COME TO ME

03:19:41.502 --> 03:19:45.073
AND SAID THAT BECAUSE OF OF THE

03:19:45.139 --> 03:19:48.676
OF THE PRIVILEGE, THE

03:19:48.743 --> 03:19:50.478
CONFIDENTIALITY PRIVILEGE THAT

03:19:50.545 --> 03:19:53.147
PEOPLE TRUST BETWEEN CLERGY AND

03:19:53.214 --> 03:19:56.617
AND INDIVIDUALS, THEY HEAR

03:19:56.684 --> 03:19:57.285
COMPLAINTS ABOUT ACTUAL

03:19:57.352 --> 03:20:02.357
RETALIATION OR WORSE, AND AND

03:20:02.423 --> 03:20:05.226
SO I BELIEVE IT IT OCCURS AND I

03:20:05.293 --> 03:20:06.394
DON'T THINK AGAIN, OSHA

03:20:06.461 --> 03:20:08.796
CONTRADICTED ANY OF THAT. BUT

03:20:08.863 --> 03:20:09.697
THE QUESTION IS, DID THE

03:20:09.764 --> 03:20:13.534
AUDITOR LOOK AT IN THE CASE

03:20:13.601 --> 03:20:18.373
FILES OR. WHETHER YOU STUDIED

03:20:18.439 --> 03:20:20.808
THEM OR NOT? DID YOU COME

03:20:20.875 --> 03:20:24.579
ACROSS FILES WHERE THERE WAS

03:20:24.645 --> 03:20:26.881
JUST A NONRESPONSIVE

03:20:26.948 --> 03:20:30.184
COMPLAINANT, AND IF SO, WHAT

03:20:30.251 --> 03:20:32.620
WAS YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF

03:20:32.687 --> 03:20:36.224
THOSE? A CLAIM THAT WASN'T

03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:38.526
PERFECTED AND THEREFORE WE WE

03:20:38.593 --> 03:20:40.294
WOULDN'T NEED TO LOOK AT IT IN

03:20:40.361 --> 03:20:42.430
THE AUDIT OR, OR SOMETHING ELSE

03:20:42.497 --> 03:20:44.298
OR, OR PERHAPS YOU JUST PUT

03:20:44.365 --> 03:20:45.500
THOSE IN A DIFFERENT PILE

03:20:45.566 --> 03:20:48.069
BECAUSE THEY, THEY DIDN'T HAVE,

03:20:48.136 --> 03:20:49.837
YOU KNOW, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT

03:20:49.904 --> 03:20:51.472
KIND OF CLOSURE THAT THE REST

03:20:51.539 --> 03:20:53.608
OF THESE CASES DID. THANK YOU

03:20:53.674 --> 03:20:55.443
FOR THE QUESTION. OUR CASE FILE

03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:58.813
REVIEWS WERE WERE LIMITED TO A

03:20:58.880 --> 03:21:01.082
SAMPLE OF 60 ITEMS, 60 CASES,

03:21:01.149 --> 03:21:02.817
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SPECIFIC

03:21:02.884 --> 03:21:04.719
CASES INVOLVED EXAMPLES THAT

03:21:04.786 --> 03:21:05.553
YOU JUST DESCRIBED, SENATOR

03:21:05.620 --> 03:21:07.688
CORTEZ, THAT HAVE TO DEFER TO

03:21:07.755 --> 03:21:10.525
OUR AUDIT TEAM LEADER. YEAH.

03:21:10.591 --> 03:21:12.326
THANK YOU. WE DID SEE CASE

03:21:12.393 --> 03:21:14.762
FILES WITH ANONYMOUS

03:21:14.829 --> 03:21:15.363
COMPLAINANTS. AND THAT I THINK

03:21:15.430 --> 03:21:17.265
WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF FOLKS,

03:21:17.331 --> 03:21:19.367
IS PARTLY TO DO WITH FEARS OF

03:21:19.434 --> 03:21:20.268
RETALIATION. IT COULD BE A LOT

03:21:20.334 --> 03:21:21.469
OF FACTORS WHY A COMPLAINANT

03:21:21.536 --> 03:21:23.404
REMAINS ANONYMOUS. BUT WE DID

03:21:23.471 --> 03:21:24.305
SEE THAT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

03:21:24.372 --> 03:21:26.374
WE TALK ABOUT IN THE REPORT IS

03:21:26.441 --> 03:21:28.309
TRYING TO CHANGE POLICY TO

03:21:28.376 --> 03:21:31.112
INSPECT MORE OF THOSE CASES.

03:21:31.179 --> 03:21:33.347
THE WAY THE CURRENT POLICY WAS

03:21:33.414 --> 03:21:35.149
WORKING IS THAT ANONYMOUS

03:21:35.216 --> 03:21:36.384
COMPLAINTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO

03:21:36.451 --> 03:21:38.386
BE INSPECTED IF THEY WEREN'T

03:21:38.453 --> 03:21:40.221
CLEARLY A SERIOUS OR IMMINENT

03:21:40.288 --> 03:21:41.489
HAZARD. SO THAT WAS ONE THING

03:21:41.556 --> 03:21:43.191
WE LOOKED AT. BUT THE OTHER

03:21:43.257 --> 03:21:45.259
THING IS THAT BASED ON WHAT WE

03:21:45.326 --> 03:21:47.395
SAW IN THE CASE FILES, A

03:21:47.462 --> 03:21:48.196
COMPLAINANTS NON-RESPONSE AFTER

03:21:48.262 --> 03:21:50.231
THE INITIAL COMPLAINT WOULD NOT

03:21:50.298 --> 03:21:52.133
NECESSARILY PRECLUDE CAL-OSHA

03:21:52.200 --> 03:21:53.267
FROM TAKING ACTION SO THEY

03:21:53.334 --> 03:21:55.436
COULD STILL GO OUT AND INSPECT

03:21:55.503 --> 03:21:56.604
A SITE. THEY DO PROACTIVE

03:21:56.671 --> 03:21:57.672
INSPECTIONS WHERE THERE IS NO

03:21:57.738 --> 03:21:59.607
COMPLAINANT, SO IT'S NOT

03:21:59.674 --> 03:22:00.174
NECESSARILY DEPENDENT ON THE

03:22:00.241 --> 03:22:01.375
COMPLAINANT TO KEEP INTERACTING

03:22:01.442 --> 03:22:04.412
WITH THEM. YEAH. THANK YOU FOR

03:22:04.479 --> 03:22:06.614
THAT CLARIFICATION. AND AND I

03:22:06.681 --> 03:22:08.382
REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, OSHA GIVING

03:22:08.449 --> 03:22:10.885
THAT EXACT RESPONSE AND IN FACT

03:22:10.952 --> 03:22:12.820
GIVING A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF

03:22:12.887 --> 03:22:15.122
GOING OUT, YOU KNOW, TO FURTHER

03:22:15.189 --> 03:22:17.358
NOT ONLY TO INSPECT, BUT TO

03:22:17.425 --> 03:22:19.327
SORT OF PURSUE WHETHER OR NOT

03:22:19.393 --> 03:22:20.528
THE COMPLAINANT WAS WAS

03:22:20.595 --> 03:22:22.964
EMPLOYED, WHETHER OR NOT OTHER

03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:24.765
PEOPLE HAD EXPERIENCED THE FACT

03:22:24.832 --> 03:22:26.734
PATTERN IN THE COMPLAINT BEYOND

03:22:26.801 --> 03:22:29.170
JUST THE COMPLAINANT. BUT OF

03:22:29.237 --> 03:22:30.471
COURSE, AND WE WE COME FULL

03:22:30.538 --> 03:22:34.809
CIRCLE TO THIS ISSUE OF, OF

03:22:34.876 --> 03:22:36.878
CAPACITY TO INSPECT. OBVIOUSLY

03:22:36.944 --> 03:22:37.445
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET VERY

03:22:37.512 --> 03:22:40.615
FAR WITH A LETTER AND PUSH BACK

03:22:40.681 --> 03:22:42.717
IF I'M IF I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT.

03:22:42.783 --> 03:22:44.519
IF YOU HAVE A NONRESPONSIVE

03:22:44.585 --> 03:22:47.221
COMPLAINANT AND A NONRESPONSIVE

03:22:47.288 --> 03:22:50.057
EMPLOYER AT THE SAME TIME, BUT

03:22:50.124 --> 03:22:52.960
IT SEEMED TO IT SEEMED TO US

03:22:53.027 --> 03:22:54.462
DURING THAT DISCUSSION THAT WE

03:22:54.529 --> 03:22:56.330
HAD A HUGE PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS

03:22:56.397 --> 03:22:59.133
IN THE CASES OF RETALIATION,

03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:01.602
WHICH ARE THE VERY CASES WE'D

03:23:01.669 --> 03:23:02.370
WANT TO, I THINK, AS

03:23:02.436 --> 03:23:03.738
LEGISLATORS PURSUE WITH THE

03:23:03.804 --> 03:23:06.173
MOST VIGOR, WHEN WE DON'T HAVE

03:23:06.240 --> 03:23:09.076
THE CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY GO OUT

03:23:09.143 --> 03:23:11.979
AND PHYSICALLY DETERMINE WHAT'S

03:23:12.046 --> 03:23:14.282
GOING ON. ANY DISAGREEMENT WITH

03:23:14.348 --> 03:23:16.317
THAT JUST BASED ON YOUR OWN

03:23:16.384 --> 03:23:18.853
WORK? I KNOW YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT

03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:19.487
THOSE SPECIFICALLY, BUT IF I'M

03:23:19.554 --> 03:23:22.189
SAYING SOMETHING OUT OF, YOU

03:23:22.256 --> 03:23:23.524
KNOW, IF I'M TAKING LIBERTIES

03:23:23.591 --> 03:23:25.393
HERE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. NO,

03:23:25.459 --> 03:23:27.161
SENATOR, I DON'T THINK YOU'VE

03:23:27.228 --> 03:23:28.296
TAKEN LIBERTIES. YOU KNOW, AS

03:23:28.362 --> 03:23:30.631
ONE OF THE THE OBSERVATIONS

03:23:30.698 --> 03:23:32.233
THAT'S BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT TODAY

03:23:32.300 --> 03:23:34.402
IS, YOU KNOW, THESE LETTER

03:23:34.468 --> 03:23:35.536
INVESTIGATIONS WHERE THE

03:23:35.603 --> 03:23:37.471
EMPLOYER IS SELF REVIEWING ITS

03:23:37.538 --> 03:23:40.808
OWN OPERATIONS. THEY DON'T

03:23:40.875 --> 03:23:43.511
RESULT IN FINES AND PENALTIES.

03:23:43.578 --> 03:23:46.147
AND THE OTHER DISCUSSION TODAY

03:23:46.213 --> 03:23:48.349
THAT I TAKE NOTE OF IS THIS

03:23:48.416 --> 03:23:49.984
DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO FORWARD

03:23:50.051 --> 03:23:51.485
INSTANCES OF WORKER COMPLAINTS

03:23:51.552 --> 03:23:53.487
TO THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY THAT

03:23:53.554 --> 03:23:56.424
CAN ENFORCE FAIR LABOR

03:23:56.490 --> 03:23:57.625
PRACTICES, WHETHER IT'S GOING

03:23:57.692 --> 03:23:58.859
TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S

03:23:58.926 --> 03:24:01.395
OFFICE OR SOMEPLACE ELSE, BUT

03:24:01.462 --> 03:24:03.064
REFERRALS TO OTHER STATE

03:24:03.130 --> 03:24:04.298
AGENCIES, LIKE THE LABOR

03:24:04.365 --> 03:24:06.968
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE, WAS NOT

03:24:07.034 --> 03:24:08.836
A FOCUS OF OUR AUDIT AND WASN'T

03:24:08.903 --> 03:24:09.303
PART OF OUR SCOPE AND

03:24:09.370 --> 03:24:14.275
OBJECTIVES. THANK YOU. MOVING

03:24:14.342 --> 03:24:16.544
ON A LITTLE BIT HERE TO TRYING

03:24:16.611 --> 03:24:19.280
TO FIX THIS PROBLEM OF OF

03:24:19.347 --> 03:24:21.115
RESPONSIVENESS AND CAPACITY.

03:24:21.182 --> 03:24:23.250
AND I HEARD THE TESTIMONY ABOUT

03:24:23.317 --> 03:24:28.322
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS AND HOW

03:24:28.389 --> 03:24:30.224
PERHAPS SOME EXPANSION THERE,

03:24:30.291 --> 03:24:32.293
YOU KNOW, COULD MAKE HIRING

03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:35.096
EASIER OR MORE EFFECTIVE OR

03:24:35.162 --> 03:24:36.430
WHATEVER THE WORDS WERE THAT

03:24:36.497 --> 03:24:39.100
WERE USED COULD HELP FIX THE

03:24:39.166 --> 03:24:40.334
PROBLEM. HAS THERE BEEN AND

03:24:40.401 --> 03:24:43.337
THIS IS, YOU KNOW, FOR THE REST

03:24:43.404 --> 03:24:45.406
OF THE PANEL, NOT THE AUDITOR,

03:24:45.473 --> 03:24:47.308
BUT I WELCOME THE AUDITOR TO TO

03:24:47.375 --> 03:24:51.712
MAKE ANY OBSERVATIONS HERE. HAS

03:24:51.779 --> 03:24:52.546
THERE BEEN DISCUSSION WITHIN

03:24:52.613 --> 03:24:55.716
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF, YOU

03:24:55.783 --> 03:24:57.284
KNOW, TAKING URGENCY MEASURES,

03:24:57.351 --> 03:24:59.320
WHETHER THAT BE EXECUTIVE ORDER

03:24:59.387 --> 03:25:03.257
OR OTHER EXECUTIVE POWERS, TO

03:25:03.324 --> 03:25:05.726
TO WAIVE SOME OF THESE

03:25:05.793 --> 03:25:07.194
REQUIREMENTS, ACCELERATE HIRING,

03:25:07.261 --> 03:25:08.396
MAKE IT EASIER FOR STATE

03:25:08.462 --> 03:25:10.598
EMPLOYEES TO MOVE FROM ONE CODE

03:25:10.665 --> 03:25:13.467
OR ONE DIVISION TO A TO ANOTHER

03:25:13.534 --> 03:25:16.270
SO THAT THEY CAN, YOU KNOW,

03:25:16.337 --> 03:25:18.739
FILL SOME OF THESE POSITIONS. I

03:25:18.806 --> 03:25:19.740
MEAN, WHAT HAS HAPPENED BESIDES

03:25:19.807 --> 03:25:21.275
JUST GENERAL HIRING OUTREACH

03:25:21.342 --> 03:25:23.444
WORK THAT WE SEE HERE IN SOME

03:25:23.511 --> 03:25:25.246
OF THE SOME OF THE

03:25:25.312 --> 03:25:26.347
DOCUMENTATION? I'D LIKE TO KNOW

03:25:26.414 --> 03:25:28.749
WHAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS, YOU

03:25:28.816 --> 03:25:30.184
KNOW, WHAT'S WHAT'S OCCURRED IN

03:25:30.251 --> 03:25:33.487
THOSE DISCUSSIONS, IF ANYTHING.

03:25:33.554 --> 03:25:35.322
YOU'RE PRESENTING IT TO US.

03:25:35.389 --> 03:25:36.557
WE'RE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.

03:25:36.624 --> 03:25:37.725
WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO

03:25:37.792 --> 03:25:39.660
ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. I'M

03:25:39.727 --> 03:25:40.928
PRETTY SURE A COUPLE OF THE

03:25:40.995 --> 03:25:42.196
LEGISLATORS HERE WOULD DO SO

03:25:42.263 --> 03:25:43.364
IMMEDIATELY. IF WE HAD THAT

03:25:43.431 --> 03:25:45.332
POWER, WE WOULD JUST SAY, WAIVE

03:25:45.399 --> 03:25:46.100
THE DAMN MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS,

03:25:46.167 --> 03:25:47.368
GET THOSE POSITIONS FILLED, USE

03:25:47.435 --> 03:25:49.437
YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AS TO

03:25:49.503 --> 03:25:50.171
QUALIFICATIONS, AND START

03:25:50.237 --> 03:25:53.340
MOVING. I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF

03:25:53.407 --> 03:25:54.475
THERE'S DISCUSSIONS LIKE THAT

03:25:54.542 --> 03:25:56.043
GOING ON AT THE EXECUTIVE

03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:57.278
BRANCH, WHERE THAT POWER IS

03:25:57.344 --> 03:26:01.148
REALLY HELD. SO THANK YOU FOR

03:26:01.215 --> 03:26:02.483
THE QUESTION. I'M NOT AWARE OF

03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:03.784
THESE DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING AT

03:26:03.851 --> 03:26:06.320
THAT LEVEL. WHO DO YOU TALK TO

03:26:06.387 --> 03:26:08.889
ABOUT IT BESIDES US? I MEAN,

03:26:08.956 --> 03:26:10.157
YOU MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO US

03:26:10.224 --> 03:26:11.525
ABOUT THE MODIFICATION OF

03:26:11.592 --> 03:26:12.993
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS.

03:26:13.060 --> 03:26:14.195
OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE NOT THE HR

03:26:14.261 --> 03:26:15.830
DEPARTMENT AND WE'RE NOT THE

03:26:15.896 --> 03:26:17.898
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. SO IS THIS

03:26:17.965 --> 03:26:21.435
JUST SOMETHING INTERNAL TO TO

03:26:21.502 --> 03:26:23.237
OSHA? YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU

03:26:23.304 --> 03:26:26.040
TALK ABOUT IT AND KEEP IT TO

03:26:26.107 --> 03:26:27.341
YOURSELVES. OTHER THAN WHEN

03:26:27.408 --> 03:26:29.343
THERE'S A HEARING LIKE THIS, I

03:26:29.410 --> 03:26:31.612
THINK WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN

03:26:31.679 --> 03:26:33.681
EMPATHIZE WITH THE PROBLEM. BUT

03:26:33.748 --> 03:26:35.583
I THINK I WANT TO KNOW WHAT

03:26:35.649 --> 03:26:37.818
YOU'RE DOING TO, YOU KNOW, TO

03:26:37.885 --> 03:26:40.187
TO ACCELERATE THAT REMEDY. SO

03:26:40.254 --> 03:26:43.424
ACTUALLY, I DO THINK WE ARE IT

03:26:43.491 --> 03:26:45.292
MAY NOT FEEL THAT WAY, BUT WE

03:26:45.359 --> 03:26:46.994
ARE ACTUALLY EXPEDITING THIS

03:26:47.061 --> 03:26:49.530
PROCESS. I THINK HR HAS

03:26:49.597 --> 03:26:51.265
ACTUALLY PLAYED A MUCH MORE

03:26:51.332 --> 03:26:54.268
INTIMATE ROLE IN UPDATING THE

03:26:54.335 --> 03:26:56.604
MKZ AND THE CLASSIFICATION IN

03:26:56.670 --> 03:26:58.172
GENERAL. I THINK ONE OF THE

03:26:58.239 --> 03:27:00.241
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IS WE'RE

03:27:00.307 --> 03:27:01.609
RELYING ON DATA THROUGH SURVEYS

03:27:01.675 --> 03:27:04.178
AND INTERVIEWS TO ACTUALLY

03:27:04.245 --> 03:27:05.513
DRIVE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT

03:27:05.579 --> 03:27:08.382
THE MQ SHOULD BE. AND THAT'S

03:27:08.449 --> 03:27:11.385
THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING TIME. AND

03:27:11.452 --> 03:27:13.354
ALTHOUGH IT'S EXPEDITED AND CAL

03:27:13.420 --> 03:27:15.222
HR IS PLAYING A LEAD ROLE IN

03:27:15.289 --> 03:27:19.026
REVIEWING THE SPECS WITH US AND

03:27:19.093 --> 03:27:21.495
DEVELOPING THE BOARD ITEM FOR

03:27:21.562 --> 03:27:23.297
THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD,

03:27:23.364 --> 03:27:25.166
THAT'S PRIMARILY HOW WE'RE

03:27:25.232 --> 03:27:28.002
WE'RE EXPEDITING THIS PROCESS.

03:27:28.068 --> 03:27:30.538
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT

03:27:30.604 --> 03:27:32.273
TO SAY MORE, DIRECTOR, BUT I

03:27:32.339 --> 03:27:34.041
WOULD JUST AGAIN, COMING INTO

03:27:34.108 --> 03:27:35.276
THIS WITH KNOWING THE

03:27:35.342 --> 03:27:37.344
BACKGROUND OF HOW THE PROCESS

03:27:37.411 --> 03:27:38.245
OF THESE THINGS TAKE, I WOULD

03:27:38.312 --> 03:27:42.383
SAY THAT I WAS IMPRESSED BY HOW

03:27:42.449 --> 03:27:43.417
HR APPEARS TO BE LEANING INTO

03:27:43.484 --> 03:27:45.352
THIS. I THINK SOMETIMES THERE

03:27:45.419 --> 03:27:47.087
BELIEVE ME, THERE'S MANY STATE

03:27:47.154 --> 03:27:48.255
CLASSIFICATIONS THAT ARE IN

03:27:48.322 --> 03:27:50.424
NEED OF THEIR CLASS BEING

03:27:50.491 --> 03:27:52.226
UPDATED AND CAL HR, FROM WHAT

03:27:52.293 --> 03:27:54.528
I'VE SEEN IN MY SHORT TIME HAS

03:27:54.595 --> 03:27:57.164
BEEN PRETTY. I THINK ALMOST

03:27:57.231 --> 03:27:59.366
EMBEDDED A LITTLE BIT IN THE

03:27:59.433 --> 03:28:00.467
PROCESS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:28:00.534 --> 03:28:02.236
ALL OF THIS STILL HAS TO GO TO

03:28:02.303 --> 03:28:03.470
THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD, BUT

03:28:03.537 --> 03:28:04.572
I THINK THEY'RE DOING

03:28:04.638 --> 03:28:06.807
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO TO MOVE

03:28:06.874 --> 03:28:07.808
MUCH FASTER THAN NORMAL. ANDREW,

03:28:07.875 --> 03:28:09.643
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE MORE

03:28:09.710 --> 03:28:11.245
INSIGHT. I JUST HAD ONE OTHER

03:28:11.312 --> 03:28:12.379
COMMENT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING

03:28:12.446 --> 03:28:13.714
ABOUT A SPECIFICATION REVISION,

03:28:13.781 --> 03:28:15.249
IT'S NOT JUST ONE. IN THIS CASE,

03:28:15.316 --> 03:28:17.585
CAL-OSHA HAS 26 SPECS THAT NEED

03:28:17.651 --> 03:28:19.520
TO BE REVISED. THEY'RE ALL

03:28:19.587 --> 03:28:21.755
ENGINEERS. THEY DO SIMILAR WORK

03:28:21.822 --> 03:28:23.090
BUT NOT IDENTICAL WORK, AND

03:28:23.157 --> 03:28:25.459
THEY ARE ALL PAID PRETTY MUCH

03:28:25.526 --> 03:28:27.695
THE SAME. ACTUALLY, I THINK THE

03:28:27.761 --> 03:28:28.662
PAY IS IDENTICAL. SO KELLEHER

03:28:28.729 --> 03:28:30.865
WANTS TO HAVE CONSISTENCY IN

03:28:30.931 --> 03:28:32.700
THE SPECIFICATIONS THAT WE'RE

03:28:32.766 --> 03:28:34.201
REVISING BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH

03:28:34.268 --> 03:28:36.070
AN INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT

03:28:36.136 --> 03:28:38.873
THE DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS

03:28:38.939 --> 03:28:41.175
DO. SO THERE'S SOME UNIQUENESS

03:28:41.242 --> 03:28:42.576
WITH CAL, CAL OSHA THAT

03:28:42.643 --> 03:28:44.278
PROBABLY DON'T EXIST WITH OTHER

03:28:44.345 --> 03:28:45.646
CLASSIFICATIONS, JUST BECAUSE

03:28:45.713 --> 03:28:47.348
OF THE SCOPE AND NUMBER OF

03:28:47.414 --> 03:28:48.549
CLASSIFICATIONS WE'RE DEALING

03:28:48.616 --> 03:28:50.351
WITH. AND WOULD YOU OPPOSE

03:28:50.417 --> 03:28:52.586
LEGISLATION THAT'S THAT

03:28:52.653 --> 03:28:53.554
SIMPLIFIED, THAT REDUCED THE

03:28:53.621 --> 03:28:56.290
NUMBER OF CLASSIFICATIONS. SO

03:28:56.357 --> 03:28:57.424
ACTUALLY THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:28:57.491 --> 03:28:58.659
THINGS THAT WE'RE ASKING THEM

03:28:58.726 --> 03:29:00.294
TO DO IS TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER

03:29:00.361 --> 03:29:01.762
OF CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WE'RE

03:29:01.829 --> 03:29:03.464
WE'RE USING IN ADDITION TO THE

03:29:03.530 --> 03:29:05.165
MKZ AND THE SCOPE WITHIN THE

03:29:05.232 --> 03:29:07.534
SPECIFICATION. BUT IF THERE WAS,

03:29:07.601 --> 03:29:09.203
IF THERE WERE, IF I WERE TO

03:29:09.270 --> 03:29:11.605
BRING LEGISLATION NEXT YEAR TO

03:29:11.672 --> 03:29:12.339
CONSOLIDATE THOSE

03:29:12.406 --> 03:29:13.140
CLASSIFICATIONS, REDUCE THEM

03:29:13.207 --> 03:29:16.277
AND DIRECT CAL HR TO

03:29:16.343 --> 03:29:18.279
DRAMATICALLY OPEN UP HIRING

03:29:18.345 --> 03:29:20.381
WITHIN THE NEXT CALENDAR YEAR,

03:29:20.447 --> 03:29:21.682
WOULD YOU OPPOSE THAT FOR COST

03:29:21.749 --> 03:29:23.617
OR OTHER REASONS? FOR

03:29:23.684 --> 03:29:25.686
APPROPRIATIONS REASONS? DO YOU

03:29:25.753 --> 03:29:27.087
LIKE THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS?

03:29:27.154 --> 03:29:28.956
WOULD YOU WOULD YOU FIGHT TO

03:29:29.023 --> 03:29:29.924
KEEP THEM, OR WOULD YOU

03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:31.759
COOPERATE WITH THAT KIND OF

03:29:31.825 --> 03:29:34.628
LEGISLATION? I DON'T THINK WE

03:29:34.695 --> 03:29:37.264
CAN SPEAK TO POTENTIAL

03:29:37.331 --> 03:29:39.833
LEGISLATION, BUT I THINK THAT

03:29:39.900 --> 03:29:41.268
WE WOULD WE ARE GENERALLY

03:29:41.335 --> 03:29:42.603
SUPPORTIVE OF CALHERN'S EFFORT

03:29:42.670 --> 03:29:44.104
TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WE

03:29:44.171 --> 03:29:46.640
JUST KNOW THAT IT'S IT TAKES A

03:29:46.707 --> 03:29:47.474
LONG TIME BECAUSE, AS ANDREW

03:29:47.541 --> 03:29:49.143
SAID, THERE'S THERE'S OTHER

03:29:49.209 --> 03:29:50.844
CLASSIFICATIONS THAT ARE

03:29:50.911 --> 03:29:52.379
IMPACTED BY MAKING CHANGES TO

03:29:52.446 --> 03:29:53.714
THIS ONE THAT IT CREATES KIND

03:29:53.781 --> 03:29:55.316
OF A RIPPLE EFFECT THROUGH

03:29:55.382 --> 03:29:57.384
OTHERS. AND I THINK ANYTHING I

03:29:57.451 --> 03:29:58.185
THINK GENERALLY, KELLEHER HAS

03:29:58.252 --> 03:30:00.354
BEEN WORKING TO, IN A LARGER

03:30:00.421 --> 03:30:02.690
SENSE FOR MANY YEARS AND LARGER

03:30:02.756 --> 03:30:05.259
CLASS CONSOLIDATION. AND SO I

03:30:05.326 --> 03:30:07.227
THINK WE SUPPORT THEM IN THIS

03:30:07.294 --> 03:30:09.396
EFFORT. WE WOULD LOVE FOR THIS

03:30:09.463 --> 03:30:11.432
TO HAPPEN LIKE THIS, BUT WE WE

03:30:11.498 --> 03:30:12.700
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE, YOU

03:30:12.766 --> 03:30:13.467
KNOW, JUST BARRIERS THAT ARE

03:30:13.534 --> 03:30:15.336
OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL TO DO

03:30:15.402 --> 03:30:17.338
THAT. YEAH. I JUST WANTED TO

03:30:17.404 --> 03:30:19.340
ADD THAT I THINK WE'RE LOOKING

03:30:19.406 --> 03:30:20.541
AT THE DATA. WE ARE OPEN TO

03:30:20.607 --> 03:30:22.276
CLASS CONSOLIDATION AND TO

03:30:22.343 --> 03:30:23.444
EMPHASIZE WE'RE HOPING THAT

03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:25.412
THIS REPORT AND THE PROPOSED

03:30:25.479 --> 03:30:26.180
SPECIFICATION REVISIONS ARE

03:30:26.246 --> 03:30:28.382
DONE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

03:30:28.449 --> 03:30:30.851
NEXT CALENDAR YEAR. SO, MARCH

03:30:30.918 --> 03:30:33.821
Ó YOU'VE HEARD THE OLD,

03:30:33.887 --> 03:30:37.424
SOMETIMES HUMOROUS ANECDOTE OR

03:30:37.491 --> 03:30:39.126
LINE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT WE'RE

03:30:39.193 --> 03:30:41.462
HERE TO HELP, WHICH A LOT OF

03:30:41.528 --> 03:30:43.063
PEOPLE DON'T RECEIVE WELL OUT

03:30:43.130 --> 03:30:45.599
IN THE COMMUNITY. OF COURSE,

03:30:45.666 --> 03:30:46.433
WE'RE THE LEGISLATURE. WE'RE

03:30:46.500 --> 03:30:49.236
HERE TO HELP. AND IT MIGHT BE A

03:30:49.303 --> 03:30:50.337
LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT

03:30:50.404 --> 03:30:53.173
WE CAN'T HELP UNLESS WE'RE

03:30:53.240 --> 03:30:55.809
GIVEN, YOU KNOW, A MENU OF OF

03:30:55.876 --> 03:30:58.879
OPTIONS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

03:30:58.946 --> 03:31:01.615
COOPERATE WITH. I DON'T THINK

03:31:01.682 --> 03:31:03.283
ANY LEGISLATION THAT WE COULD

03:31:03.350 --> 03:31:04.585
BRING FORWARD THAT WOULD ASSIST

03:31:04.651 --> 03:31:06.086
YOU WITH STREAMLINING HIRING

03:31:06.153 --> 03:31:08.389
PROCESSES IS IS GOING TO

03:31:08.455 --> 03:31:11.225
SURVIVE WITHOUT THE COOPERATION

03:31:11.291 --> 03:31:14.428
OF, OF OF YOUR OFFICE'S, OF

03:31:14.495 --> 03:31:16.196
YOUR OWN LEADERSHIP AND THE

03:31:16.263 --> 03:31:20.467
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. SO WHAT I

03:31:20.534 --> 03:31:24.071
WOULD RECOMMEND AND, YOU KNOW,

03:31:24.138 --> 03:31:26.707
HOPEFULLY PEOPLE HAVE THE THE

03:31:26.774 --> 03:31:30.944
GUMPTION TO DO THAT IS TO TAKE.

03:31:31.011 --> 03:31:33.313
THE MOST AGGRESSIVE REMEDIES

03:31:33.380 --> 03:31:35.349
FOR EXPEDITING THIS HIRING

03:31:35.416 --> 03:31:37.251
PROCESS AS HIGH AS YOU POSSIBLY

03:31:37.317 --> 03:31:39.353
CAN IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH,

03:31:39.420 --> 03:31:42.022
WHICH I WOULD SAY WOULD BE THE

03:31:42.089 --> 03:31:45.359
GOVERNOR. AND ASK FOR ANY

03:31:45.426 --> 03:31:46.126
LEGISLATIVE ENABLING

03:31:46.193 --> 03:31:48.395
LEGISLATION THAT THAT YOU NEED

03:31:48.462 --> 03:31:50.864
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AS SOON AS

03:31:50.931 --> 03:31:51.498
POSSIBLE. PEOPLE ARE DYING. I'M

03:31:51.565 --> 03:31:53.467
NOT GOING TO ASK MY QUESTIONS

03:31:53.534 --> 03:31:55.069
ABOUT HEAT ILLNESS, BUT I THINK

03:31:55.135 --> 03:31:56.336
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION

03:31:56.403 --> 03:31:58.539
IS OUT THERE. I'M SURE YOU'D

03:31:58.605 --> 03:32:01.175
LIKE TO BE OUT THERE WITH

03:32:01.241 --> 03:32:02.443
INSPECTORS ON THE SPOT, YOU

03:32:02.509 --> 03:32:04.244
KNOW, WITHIN 3 TO 14 DAYS,

03:32:04.311 --> 03:32:06.146
DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF

03:32:06.213 --> 03:32:07.414
THE ALLEGATIONS. AND I DON'T

03:32:07.481 --> 03:32:09.149
BELIEVE YOU CAN GET OUT THERE.

03:32:09.216 --> 03:32:11.819
YOU KNOW, GIVEN THE INTENSITY

03:32:11.885 --> 03:32:13.921
OF THE PROBLEM AND, AND THE

03:32:13.987 --> 03:32:16.457
VOLUME OF ISSUES THAT ARE THAT

03:32:16.523 --> 03:32:18.125
ARE OUT THERE, NOT JUST WITH

03:32:18.192 --> 03:32:19.993
COMPLAINTS, BUT IN TERMS OF

03:32:20.060 --> 03:32:22.529
RANDOM INSPECTIONS TO, TO TO

03:32:22.596 --> 03:32:23.363
FORCE COMPLIANCE. SO I SAID,

03:32:23.430 --> 03:32:25.399
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT

03:32:25.466 --> 03:32:26.934
THAT, BUT THAT'S THAT'S ALL I'M

03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:28.335
GOING TO SAY ABOUT THAT. THAT'S

03:32:28.402 --> 03:32:30.671
AS URGENT AS ANYTHING THAT WE

03:32:30.737 --> 03:32:31.872
FACED DURING THE PANDEMIC, AS

03:32:31.939 --> 03:32:33.874
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. AND

03:32:33.941 --> 03:32:36.243
MERITS IN EXECUTIVE BRANCH

03:32:36.310 --> 03:32:39.379
THAT'S WILLING TO, AGAIN, SIGN

03:32:39.446 --> 03:32:40.647
EXECUTIVE ORDERS OR DO WHATEVER

03:32:40.714 --> 03:32:42.349
NEEDS TO BE DONE TO EXPEDITE

03:32:42.416 --> 03:32:43.517
THIS HIRING PROCESS, EVEN IF IT

03:32:43.584 --> 03:32:44.751
MEANS GETTING TEMPORARY

03:32:44.818 --> 03:32:47.421
EMPLOYEES IN PLACE. SO THAT'S

03:32:47.488 --> 03:32:49.089
WHAT I'M FOR. I THINK WE WOULD

03:32:49.156 --> 03:32:51.191
LIKE TO HELP IF THERE'S SOME

03:32:51.258 --> 03:32:53.360
LEGISLATION, COMPANION

03:32:53.427 --> 03:32:54.128
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD NEED TO

03:32:54.194 --> 03:32:55.329
GO ALONG WITH SOMETHING LIKE

03:32:55.395 --> 03:32:58.165
THAT. BUT I THINK WE'RE HEADED

03:32:58.232 --> 03:33:04.872
FOR. FURTHER TRAGIC OUTCOMES

03:33:04.938 --> 03:33:07.441
LIKE DEATH, SERIOUS INJURY,

03:33:07.508 --> 03:33:10.277
BEYOND WHAT WE SHOULD BE

03:33:10.344 --> 03:33:13.046
ACCEPTING OR TOLERATING AND

03:33:13.113 --> 03:33:14.281
FRANKLY, EMBARRASSMENT, YOU

03:33:14.348 --> 03:33:16.550
KNOW, AS TO HOW WE'RE

03:33:16.617 --> 03:33:19.453
CONDUCTING OURSELVES AS A STATE

03:33:19.520 --> 03:33:21.555
IF WE DON'T PULL OUT ALL THE

03:33:21.622 --> 03:33:23.524
STOPS AND AND DEAL WITH THIS.

03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:25.359
AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE,

03:33:25.425 --> 03:33:27.227
YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE END OF

03:33:27.294 --> 03:33:28.462
THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION,

03:33:28.529 --> 03:33:30.130
THAT'S MY POSITION. SO I KNOW

03:33:30.197 --> 03:33:33.333
THE LABOR CHAIRS WOULD TEND TO

03:33:33.400 --> 03:33:35.369
BE THE ONES TO TO APPROACH THAT

03:33:35.435 --> 03:33:37.337
AGGRESSIVELY. BUT YOU CERTAINLY

03:33:37.404 --> 03:33:38.539
HAVE MY SUPPORT IF YOU START

03:33:38.605 --> 03:33:39.806
GOING IN THAT DIRECTION. THANK

03:33:39.873 --> 03:33:42.176
YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU,

03:33:42.242 --> 03:33:43.143
SENATOR. SENATOR RANSOM, AND

03:33:43.210 --> 03:33:45.212
THEN WE WILL BRING UP THE LAST

03:33:45.279 --> 03:33:46.480
PANEL. THANK YOU. CHAIR, I'M

03:33:46.547 --> 03:33:48.882
GOING TO TRY TO BE VERY BRIEF

03:33:48.949 --> 03:33:50.417
FOR THE SAKE OF TIME. I THINK

03:33:50.484 --> 03:33:52.452
MY CONCERNS AND AND MY

03:33:52.519 --> 03:33:53.320
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ARE

03:33:53.387 --> 03:33:55.455
GOING TO ECHO A LOT OF THE

03:33:55.522 --> 03:33:57.691
SENTIMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD IN

03:33:57.758 --> 03:34:00.027
REGARDS TO THE WORKERS. A LOT

03:34:00.093 --> 03:34:02.129
OF THE PROCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN,

03:34:02.196 --> 03:34:04.264
AND A LOT OF THE APPROACHES AND

03:34:04.331 --> 03:34:05.999
EVEN THE REMEDIES HAVE BEEN

03:34:06.066 --> 03:34:10.771
VERY EMPLOYER FOCUSED. AND WE

03:34:10.837 --> 03:34:13.640
DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

03:34:13.707 --> 03:34:14.575
LOTS OF ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS

03:34:14.641 --> 03:34:16.143
BECAUSE FOLKS ARE CONCERNED

03:34:16.210 --> 03:34:20.214
ABOUT RETALIATION. BUT IT WOULD

03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:22.583
IT SEEMS THAT IT WOULD BE VERY

03:34:22.649 --> 03:34:25.219
HELPFUL IF WE CAN GET A WAY TO

03:34:25.285 --> 03:34:27.854
HAVE THE FOLKS WHO MADE THE

03:34:27.921 --> 03:34:29.189
COMPLAINT TO WEIGH IN ON

03:34:29.256 --> 03:34:31.558
WHETHER THE COMPLAINT IS

03:34:31.625 --> 03:34:33.527
ACTUALLY BEING RECTIFIED. AND

03:34:33.594 --> 03:34:35.495
I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU ALL

03:34:35.562 --> 03:34:37.564
HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT MAYBE IN

03:34:37.631 --> 03:34:39.566
YOUR THE, THE WHILE YOU'RE

03:34:39.633 --> 03:34:40.434
BUILDING THIS NEW SYSTEM, IS

03:34:40.500 --> 03:34:42.636
THERE A WAY THAT WHEN A PERSON

03:34:42.703 --> 03:34:44.238
FILES A COMPLAINT, THERE'LL BE

03:34:44.304 --> 03:34:46.139
A NUMBER THAT'S THEY CAN USE TO

03:34:46.206 --> 03:34:49.343
FOLLOW UP AND ADD ADDITIONAL

03:34:49.409 --> 03:34:50.510
INFORMATION, OR WHERE YOU CAN

03:34:50.577 --> 03:34:53.313
POST AND SAY CLAIM NUMBER.

03:34:53.380 --> 03:34:55.415
WHATEVER THE EMPLOYER HAS SAID,

OTHER THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING

03:36:54.501 --> 03:36:57.838
AT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH

03:36:57.904 --> 03:36:58.605
UPDATING OUR POLICIES IN

03:36:58.672 --> 03:37:00.374
REGARDS TO LETTER

03:37:00.440 --> 03:37:02.075
INVESTIGATIONS, BUT NOT JUST

03:37:02.142 --> 03:37:03.610

CONCERN ABOUT THE EXPECTATION

03:37:25.198 --> 03:37:27.601
AND OR BELIEF THAT THE EMPLOYER

03:37:27.667 --> 03:37:30.170
IS GOING TO POST THE LETTER

03:37:30.237 --> 03:37:33.106
WHEN YOU KNOW THERE IS A

03:37:33.173 --> 03:37:34.374
COMPLAINT. AND I'M WONDERING IF

03:37:34.441 --> 03:37:37.377
YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT, AS WAS

03:37:37.444 --> 03:37:39.346
KIND OF ALLUDED TO, INCLUDING

03:37:39.413 --> 03:37:41.782
IF THERE'S A BARGAINING UNIT OR

03:37:41.848 --> 03:37:44.618
SOME WAY TO NOTIFY OTHER FOLKS

03:37:44.684 --> 03:37:46.920
THAN THE EMPLOYER, BECAUSE IT'S

03:37:46.987 --> 03:37:49.790
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS TO BE

03:37:49.856 --> 03:37:53.293
EMPLOYEE CENTRIC IN REGARDS TO

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.996
HEALTH AND SAFETY. SO HAVE YOU

03:37:56.062 --> 03:37:57.197
THOUGHT ABOUT CONTACTING

03:37:57.264 --> 03:37:58.598
WHETHER IT'S BARGAINING UNITS

03:37:58.665 --> 03:38:02.235
OR REQUIRING SUPERVISORS TO,

03:38:02.302 --> 03:38:04.371
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT JUST A

03:38:04.438 --> 03:38:05.672
BREAK ROOM, YOU KNOW, TAKE YOUR

03:38:05.739 --> 03:38:07.340
BREAK POST, BUT SOMEWHERE THAT

03:38:07.407 --> 03:38:10.544
FOLKS CAN ACTUALLY DISSEMINATE

03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:17.451
THAT INFORMATION. OR WHY NOT

03:38:17.517 --> 03:38:19.486
JUST SEND IT TO EVERY EMPLOYEE?

03:38:19.553 --> 03:38:20.887
I DON'T KNOW, JUST THINKING OUT

03:38:20.954 --> 03:38:23.757
LOUD HERE. YES, I DO BELIEVE

03:38:23.824 --> 03:38:25.392
THAT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AS

03:38:25.459 --> 03:38:27.160
WELL, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE

03:38:27.227 --> 03:38:28.361
LOOKING INTO THAT AS WELL IN

03:38:28.428 --> 03:38:30.464
REGARDS TO THE UNIONS AND AND

03:38:30.530 --> 03:38:32.332
HOW WE CAN FURTHER GET THAT

03:38:32.399 --> 03:38:34.434
INFORMATION OUT. OKAY. AND THEN

03:38:34.501 --> 03:38:36.369
THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND THEN MY

03:38:36.436 --> 03:38:39.606
LAST QUESTION, ARE YOU LOOKING

03:38:39.673 --> 03:38:42.509
AT PUTTING IN MORE INFORMATION

03:38:42.576 --> 03:38:45.111
TO NOT EVEN MORE INFORMATION?

03:38:45.178 --> 03:38:47.214
THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE VERY

03:38:47.280 --> 03:38:48.482
CONCERNING TO ME. THESE FINES

03:38:48.548 --> 03:38:51.518
AND THE SUBJECTIVENESS OF THEM,

03:38:51.585 --> 03:38:52.752
I DON'T THINK THEY COMPEL

03:38:52.819 --> 03:38:54.187
ANYONE TO BE COMPLIANT. AND I

03:38:54.254 --> 03:38:57.123
THINK IT'S ALSO HEARTBREAKING

03:38:57.190 --> 03:39:00.193
TO THINK THAT WE WOULD DISCOUNT

03:39:00.260 --> 03:39:03.563
SOMEONE IN CASES WHERE THERE'S

03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:05.298
NEGLIGENCE UP UNTIL DEATH, THAT

03:39:05.365 --> 03:39:08.468
WE ARE SOMEHOW NEGOTIATING DOWN

03:39:08.535 --> 03:39:10.504
IS HAVE YOU ALL THOUGHT ABOUT,

03:39:10.570 --> 03:39:12.706
YOU KNOW, HAVING SOME

03:39:12.772 --> 03:39:16.776
NON-NEGOTIABLES IN SOME OF YOUR.

03:39:16.843 --> 03:39:18.378
WHEN THINGS ARE, WHEN PEOPLE

03:39:18.445 --> 03:39:20.413
ARE FOUND TO BE NEGLIGENT OR

03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:21.648
WHEN SOMETHING LEADS ALL THE

03:39:21.715 --> 03:39:24.251
WAY UP INTO DEATH AND OR

03:39:24.317 --> 03:39:25.519
DISMEMBERMENT. HAVE YOU LOOKED

03:39:25.585 --> 03:39:29.389
AT ONE BEING VERY FIRM AND A

03:39:29.456 --> 03:39:33.326
SYSTEM THAT, YOU KNOW, KEEPS IT

03:39:33.393 --> 03:39:35.128
CONSISTENT ACROSS EVERY

03:39:35.195 --> 03:39:36.463
EMPLOYER? LIKE I DON'T REALLY

03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:38.431
CARE THAT YOU'RE FINANCIALLY

03:39:38.498 --> 03:39:40.367
STRUGGLING IF YOU ARE CREATING

03:39:40.433 --> 03:39:43.436
HARM AND DEATH FOR FOLKS. WE

03:39:43.503 --> 03:39:45.238
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT SAYS YOU CAN

03:39:45.305 --> 03:39:47.340
ONLY RECEIVE X AMOUNT OF

03:39:47.407 --> 03:39:48.575
DISCOUNT IN IN WHATEVER THE

03:39:48.642 --> 03:39:50.310
SITUATIONS ARE. SO HAVE YOU ALL

03:39:50.377 --> 03:39:52.779
TALKED OR THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO

03:39:52.846 --> 03:39:55.348
BE CONSISTENT IN THE

03:39:55.415 --> 03:39:56.483
NEGOTIATIONS WHEN YOU WERE

03:39:56.550 --> 03:39:58.318
REDUCING FINES SO THAT ANYONE

03:39:58.385 --> 03:40:00.420
CAN PICK UP A CHART AND SAY, OH,

03:40:00.487 --> 03:40:02.756
I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THEY GOT

03:40:02.822 --> 03:40:05.425
HERE. THAT'S THAT'S PART A OF

03:40:05.492 --> 03:40:07.527
THE QUESTION. AND THEN B KIND

03:40:07.594 --> 03:40:08.628
OF HAVING A NON-NEGOTIABLE WHEN

03:40:08.695 --> 03:40:10.363
IT COMES TO LIKE DEATH,

03:40:10.430 --> 03:40:12.632
DISMEMBERMENT AND AND CERTAIN

03:40:12.699 --> 03:40:24.444
AREAS OF NEGLECT. OKAY. THERE

03:40:24.511 --> 03:40:29.149
THERE ARE OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR

03:40:29.215 --> 03:40:31.384
CITATIONS OR VIOLATIONS THAT

03:40:31.451 --> 03:40:33.753
ARE CONSIDERED ACCIDENT RELATED.

03:40:33.820 --> 03:40:34.621
SO THERE'S LIMITATIONS ALREADY

03:40:34.688 --> 03:40:40.961
THERE. BUT CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW,

03:40:41.027 --> 03:40:43.163
WE CAN WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO

03:40:43.229 --> 03:40:45.565
OTHER CONDITIONS BEING REQUIRED

03:40:45.632 --> 03:40:47.334
IN THE LABOR CODE. IT'S NOT

03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:49.402
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD I DON'T

03:40:49.469 --> 03:40:51.137
BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

03:40:51.204 --> 03:40:52.572
COULD INITIATE IN TERMS OF

03:40:52.639 --> 03:40:53.440
INTERNAL POLICY. IT WOULD NEED

03:40:53.506 --> 03:40:58.278
TO BE LAW OR REGULATION THAT

03:40:58.345 --> 03:41:00.714
THAT WE CAN POINT TO. THANK YOU.

03:41:00.780 --> 03:41:02.782
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW SOME PEOPLE

03:41:02.849 --> 03:41:04.517
WHO CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT. I

03:41:04.584 --> 03:41:05.251
WILL STATE THOUGH, THERE IS

03:41:05.318 --> 03:41:06.252
SOMETHING CURRENTLY, AND I

03:41:06.319 --> 03:41:07.554
THINK THE AUDITORS DID BRING IT

03:41:07.621 --> 03:41:09.222
UP IN REGARDS TO THE IAP. IF

03:41:09.289 --> 03:41:11.458
YOU DO NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE

03:41:11.524 --> 03:41:13.059
IAP, THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:41:13.126 --> 03:41:14.294
REDUCTIONS THAT CANNOT BE GIVEN

03:41:14.361 --> 03:41:16.262
TO YOU. AND ALSO IF THERE'S AN

03:41:16.329 --> 03:41:17.230
ACCIDENT RELATED, I THINK WHAT

03:41:17.297 --> 03:41:18.698
THE AUDITOR'S POINTED OUT AND

03:41:18.765 --> 03:41:20.333
THAT WE ARE WORKING ON IS THAT

03:41:20.400 --> 03:41:22.068
WHAT'S CRUCIAL IS THAT WE GET

03:41:22.135 --> 03:41:23.370
THE RATIONALE AND THE EVIDENCE

03:41:23.436 --> 03:41:25.372
INTO THE CASE FILE SO THAT WE

03:41:25.438 --> 03:41:26.573
CAN SUSTAIN THAT. AND SO THOSE

03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:28.241
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE

03:41:28.308 --> 03:41:29.843
WORKING ON IN REGARDS TO

03:41:29.909 --> 03:41:31.444
FATALITIES AND WHERE YOU CANNOT

03:41:31.511 --> 03:41:33.446
MAKE THAT REDUCTION. THANK YOU.

03:41:33.513 --> 03:41:35.615
I THINK WE CAN ALL APPRECIATE

03:41:35.682 --> 03:41:37.550
THAT. I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE A LOT

03:41:37.617 --> 03:41:38.785
OF WORK TO DO AND YOU'RE

03:41:38.852 --> 03:41:40.754
WORKING REALLY HARD. I JUST I

03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:41.388
WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE AND THAT

03:41:41.454 --> 03:41:43.790
AS WE DO THIS, THAT WE ARE

03:41:43.857 --> 03:41:45.025
REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE NOT

03:41:45.091 --> 03:41:46.493
THAT YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT

03:41:46.559 --> 03:41:48.395
PEOPLE, BUT YOU GOT TO

03:41:48.461 --> 03:41:49.596
COMMUNICATE A LOT WITH THE

03:41:49.663 --> 03:41:51.164
EMPLOYER. BUT ULTIMATELY WE'RE

03:41:51.231 --> 03:41:53.466
TRYING TO SAVE PEOPLE FROM, YOU

03:41:53.533 --> 03:41:55.268
KNOW, HURT, HARM AND DEATH. SO

03:41:55.335 --> 03:41:57.170
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

03:41:57.237 --> 03:41:58.271

NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE,

03:42:08.181 --> 03:42:10.316
AND I WILL NOW CALL UP OUR

03:42:10.383 --> 03:42:13.186
THIRD AND LAST PANEL TO PROVIDE

03:42:13.253 --> 03:42:14.421
PERSPECTIVES ON THE AUDIT. AND

03:42:14.487 --> 03:42:16.122
THAT IS GOING TO BE ELMER

03:42:16.189 --> 03:42:17.323
LUSARDI, WHO IS WITH THE

03:42:17.390 --> 03:42:18.425

UNIONS, STEVEN KNIGHT, WHO IS

AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE

03:42:32.505 --> 03:42:35.108
AND SITTING THROUGH THE HEARING.

03:42:35.175 --> 03:42:37.444
I WOULD GIVE YOU EACH FIVE

03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:39.079
MINUTES TO KIND OF MAKE OPENING

03:42:40.413 --> 03:42:42.515
THINK YOU HAVE SEEN THE ROBUST

03:42:42.582 --> 03:42:43.683
QUESTIONS AND AND COMMENTS IN

03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:45.285
THE DISCUSSIONS. AND AND SO I

03:42:45.351 --> 03:42:47.687
WOULD I WOULD PROBABLY

03:42:47.754 --> 03:42:49.489
RECOMMEND LEAVING MORE TIME FOR

03:42:49.556 --> 03:42:51.758
US TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AND

03:42:51.825 --> 03:42:54.160
REALLY ALLOWING US TO TO PRESS

03:42:54.227 --> 03:42:56.296
YOU MAYBE IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS.

03:42:56.362 --> 03:43:00.300
AND SO WITH THAT, I WILL TURN

03:43:00.366 --> 03:43:01.668
IT OVER TO MR. LUSARDI WHENEVER

03:43:01.735 --> 03:43:03.703
HE'S READY. THANK YOU, THANK

03:43:03.770 --> 03:43:05.538
YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE.

03:43:05.605 --> 03:43:06.239
ELMER LUSARDI, I'M A

03:43:06.306 --> 03:43:08.241
LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE

03:43:08.308 --> 03:43:09.442
CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF LABOR

03:43:09.509 --> 03:43:10.443
UNIONS. WE REPRESENT 2.3

03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:12.479
MILLION UNION MEMBERS IN THE

03:43:12.545 --> 03:43:14.514
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO

03:43:14.581 --> 03:43:16.149
THANK YOU ALL FOR PUTTING THIS

03:43:16.216 --> 03:43:17.217
TOGETHER AND ALLOWING US TO

03:43:17.283 --> 03:43:18.551
GIVE THE WORKER PERSPECTIVE. I

03:43:18.618 --> 03:43:20.453
DO, HOWEVER, WANT TO START BY

03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:22.555
SHIFTING THE LENS A LITTLE BIT

03:43:22.622 --> 03:43:24.591
WITH HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

03:43:24.657 --> 03:43:26.192
ISSUES RAISED IN THE AUDIT,

03:43:26.259 --> 03:43:28.328
BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT US TO

03:43:28.394 --> 03:43:29.496
MISS THE BIGGER PICTURE, WHICH

03:43:29.562 --> 03:43:31.531
IS THAT THE REASON WE'RE HERE

03:43:31.598 --> 03:43:32.298
IS BECAUSE EMPLOYERS ARE

03:43:32.365 --> 03:43:35.101
CONSISTENTLY BREAKING THE LAW,

03:43:35.168 --> 03:43:37.303
AND THEY'RE DOING IT AT SUCH AN

03:43:37.370 --> 03:43:38.304
ASTONISHING RATE THAT WE'VE

03:43:38.371 --> 03:43:40.240
BECOME DESENSITIZED TO IT. WE

03:43:40.306 --> 03:43:42.442
READ ALL THESE HORRIFIC STORIES

03:43:42.509 --> 03:43:44.210
IN THE AUDIT, AND THEN

03:43:44.277 --> 03:43:46.513
AFTERWARDS WE HEAR, MAN, I WISH

03:43:46.579 --> 03:43:49.182
WE COULD HAVE PREVENTED IT. AND

03:43:49.249 --> 03:43:50.383
MEANWHILE WE FORGET THAT

03:43:50.450 --> 03:43:52.485
EMPLOYERS OFTEN DO HAVE THE

03:43:52.552 --> 03:43:54.354
MEANS AND THE ULTIMATE

03:43:54.420 --> 03:43:55.989
RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT THESE

03:43:56.055 --> 03:43:58.324
INJURIES. THEY CAN AND HAVE

03:43:58.391 --> 03:44:00.527
SOME CONTROL OVER THE WORK

03:44:00.593 --> 03:44:02.195
ENVIRONMENT, AND THEY SHOULD.

03:44:02.262 --> 03:44:04.364
AND YET, EVERY TIME THAT WE TRY

03:44:04.430 --> 03:44:06.266
TO DO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU, ALL

03:44:06.332 --> 03:44:07.333
ON POSITIVE REFORMS THAT WILL

03:44:07.400 --> 03:44:10.403
HELP PROTECT WORKERS ON THE JOB,

03:44:10.470 --> 03:44:11.171
EMPLOYERS FIGHT US TOOTH AND

03:44:11.237 --> 03:44:12.405
NAIL EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

03:44:12.472 --> 03:44:14.407
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE

03:44:14.474 --> 03:44:15.241
STATUS QUO, AS OUTLINED IN THE

03:44:15.308 --> 03:44:17.677
AUDIT, IS WORKING IN THEIR

03:44:17.744 --> 03:44:19.412
FAVOR. AND WHILE WORKERS ARE

03:44:19.479 --> 03:44:20.213
CONTRACTING ILLNESSES OR

03:44:20.280 --> 03:44:22.715
BREAKING BONES, OR FAMILIES ARE

03:44:22.782 --> 03:44:24.184
LOSING A BREADWINNER, FOR FAR

03:44:24.250 --> 03:44:25.785
TOO MANY EMPLOYERS, THAT

03:44:25.852 --> 03:44:28.154
BECOMES JUST A COST OF DOING

03:44:28.221 --> 03:44:30.390
BUSINESS. AND OF COURSE, WE HAD

03:44:30.456 --> 03:44:32.091
THE LABOR FEDERATION HAVE

03:44:32.158 --> 03:44:33.259
CONSISTENTLY PRIORITIZED LABOR

03:44:33.326 --> 03:44:35.261
LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE WE KNOW

03:44:35.328 --> 03:44:36.896
THAT WITHOUT IT, ALL THE GREAT

03:44:36.963 --> 03:44:38.464
WORK THAT EVERYONE DOES IN THE

03:44:38.531 --> 03:44:39.232
LEGISLATURE BECOMES MEANINGLESS.

03:44:39.299 --> 03:44:40.834
AND SO ENSURING THAT OUR

03:44:40.900 --> 03:44:41.668
AGENCIES ARE FUNCTIONAL AND

03:44:41.734 --> 03:44:44.337
THEY HAVE STAFFING AND THE BEST

03:44:44.404 --> 03:44:45.405
PRACTICES FOR INVESTIGATION AND

03:44:45.471 --> 03:44:46.639
THE RESOURCES, ALL THAT'S

03:44:46.706 --> 03:44:48.274
ESSENTIAL. AND I THINK THE

03:44:48.341 --> 03:44:49.576
AUDIT DOES A GREAT JOB OF

03:44:49.642 --> 03:44:50.577
HIGHLIGHTING THE STATE'S

03:44:50.643 --> 03:44:51.177
GLARING WEAKNESSES IN

03:44:51.244 --> 03:44:53.279
ENFORCEMENT. BUT WE HAVE TO

03:44:53.346 --> 03:44:54.848
REMEMBER THAT THE REAL REASON

03:44:54.914 --> 03:44:55.381
WE HAVE SUCH A WIDESPREAD

03:44:55.448 --> 03:44:57.317
HEALTH AND SAFETY CRISIS FOR

03:44:57.383 --> 03:44:59.352
WORKERS IS THAT SOME EMPLOYERS

03:44:59.419 --> 03:45:00.286
ARE ROUTINELY BREAKING THE LAW,

03:45:00.353 --> 03:45:03.356
AND WORKERS ARE EXPLOITED SO

03:45:03.423 --> 03:45:04.424
FREQUENTLY THAT THE STATE

03:45:04.490 --> 03:45:06.226
SIMPLY CANNOT KEEP UP WITH IT.

03:45:06.292 --> 03:45:08.494
YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO POINT TO

03:45:08.561 --> 03:45:09.362
AN EXAMPLE THAT ACTUALLY WAS

03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:10.396
HIGHLIGHTED BY SOME OF THE

03:45:10.463 --> 03:45:12.398
FOLKS IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL,

03:45:12.465 --> 03:45:13.166
WHEREIN A SUPERVISOR WAS

03:45:13.233 --> 03:45:15.401
DRIVING A FORKLIFT, AND THEN

03:45:15.468 --> 03:45:17.370
THE LOAD ON THE FORKLIFT FELL

03:45:17.437 --> 03:45:19.272
AND ULTIMATELY KILLED A WORKER,

03:45:19.339 --> 03:45:22.008
AND AFTERWARDS THE EMPLOYER WAS

03:45:22.075 --> 03:45:25.445
ASSESSED ABOUT $21,000 IN FINES.

03:45:25.511 --> 03:45:27.180
BUT THE POTENTIAL FINE, WHICH

03:45:27.247 --> 03:45:28.982
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASSESSED WAS

03:45:29.048 --> 03:45:30.416
ABOUT DOUBLE THAT. AND THERE'S

03:45:30.483 --> 03:45:31.584
A LOT TO UNPACK FROM THAT

03:45:31.651 --> 03:45:34.287
EXAMPLE. BUT TO MY POINT ABOUT

03:45:34.354 --> 03:45:35.855
THE STATUS QUO BENEFITING

03:45:35.922 --> 03:45:37.390
EMPLOYERS, EVEN IN THE INSTANCE

03:45:37.457 --> 03:45:40.226
OF A WORKER FATALITY, SOMEHOW

03:45:40.293 --> 03:45:42.562
THE EMPLOYER STILL GOT THEIR

03:45:42.629 --> 03:45:45.064
PENALTIES REDUCED BY 50%. AND

03:45:45.131 --> 03:45:46.466
ALL THAT SIGNALS TO EMPLOYERS

03:45:46.532 --> 03:45:48.301
IS THAT IF THINGS REMAIN THE

03:45:48.368 --> 03:45:50.103
SAME, AND ALL THE EXAMPLES IN

03:45:50.169 --> 03:45:52.305
THE AUDITS POINT TO THIS,

03:45:52.372 --> 03:45:54.507
THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO EVER GET AN

03:45:54.574 --> 03:45:56.576
IN-PERSON INSPECTION. AND IF

03:45:56.643 --> 03:45:59.245
THEY DO, AT WORST THEY WILL

03:45:59.312 --> 03:46:01.381
STILL GET THEIR PENALTY REDUCED.

03:46:01.447 --> 03:46:02.282
SO THERE'S NO REASON TO STOP

03:46:02.348 --> 03:46:04.350
CUTTING CORNERS OR TO EVEN STOP

03:46:04.417 --> 03:46:05.485
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE

03:46:05.551 --> 03:46:08.154
CONSEQUENCES ARE OF THOSE

03:46:08.221 --> 03:46:10.056
ACTIONS ON THE WORKERS ON WHICH

03:46:10.123 --> 03:46:12.292
THEY ARE PROFITING. IT IS ALSO

03:46:12.358 --> 03:46:14.294
CLEAR FROM THE EXAMPLE THAT,

03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:15.962
YOU KNOW, BETTER EVIDENCE

03:46:16.029 --> 03:46:16.663
GATHERING PRACTICES ARE

03:46:16.729 --> 03:46:17.764
REQUIRED SO THAT BLATANT

03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:19.365
VIOLATIONS LIKE THESE WILL

03:46:19.432 --> 03:46:20.333
ACTUALLY LEAD TO MORE ADEQUATE

03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:22.435
FINE DETERMINATIONS, AND THAT

03:46:22.502 --> 03:46:23.603
EMPLOYERS MAY ACTUALLY BE

03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:25.438
COMPELLED TO FOLLOW THE LAW.

03:46:25.505 --> 03:46:27.373
AND I WANT TO LEAD THAT TO SAY,

03:46:27.440 --> 03:46:29.542
FOR ALL OF US IN THE ROOM, AS

03:46:29.609 --> 03:46:30.376
WE THINK ABOUT ALL THE

03:46:30.443 --> 03:46:31.444
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:46:31.511 --> 03:46:33.713
RAISED OR THE LAPSES, LAPSES IN

03:46:33.780 --> 03:46:35.281
PROCESS, I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT

03:46:35.348 --> 03:46:37.350
ON US TO RECOGNIZE THE

03:46:37.417 --> 03:46:38.184
PRIVILEGE IN OUR POWER TO DO

03:46:38.251 --> 03:46:40.620
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IF WE HAVE

03:46:40.687 --> 03:46:42.488
TO STATUTORILY CHANGE THESE

03:46:42.555 --> 03:46:44.324
PRACTICES. I THINK THAT WE HAVE

03:46:44.390 --> 03:46:46.392
THE OBLIGATION TO DO THAT. AND,

03:46:46.459 --> 03:46:47.660
YOU KNOW, JUST IN SITTING HERE,

03:46:47.727 --> 03:46:48.461
I'VE BEEN MOVED BY THE

03:46:48.528 --> 03:46:50.330
CONVICTION OF SOME OF YOU ALL

03:46:50.396 --> 03:46:51.531
ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW, CHAIR

03:46:51.597 --> 03:46:52.632
ORTEGA'S IDEA, FOR EXAMPLE, TO

03:46:52.699 --> 03:46:54.033
INCREASE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

03:46:54.100 --> 03:46:56.336
RIGHT. STUFF LIKE THAT. AND

03:46:56.402 --> 03:46:57.103
CREATIVE WAYS TO INCREASE

03:46:57.170 --> 03:46:58.504
ENFORCEMENT ARE NECESSARY

03:46:58.571 --> 03:46:59.372
BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING AT THE

03:46:59.439 --> 03:47:02.108
FEDERAL LEVEL, OUR AGENCIES ARE

03:47:02.175 --> 03:47:03.776
BEING GUTTED. AND THAT MEANS

03:47:03.843 --> 03:47:05.378
THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE

03:47:05.445 --> 03:47:06.212
WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY

03:47:06.279 --> 03:47:07.780
CALIFORNIA THAT MUCH MORE

03:47:07.847 --> 03:47:09.882
BECAUSE, AS HAS BEEN SAID,

03:47:09.949 --> 03:47:12.618
WORKERS ARE LIVING MORE SO IN

03:47:12.685 --> 03:47:13.653
FEAR NOW THAN EVER, AND THEY'RE

03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:15.221
LESS LIKELY TO COME FORWARD AND

03:47:15.288 --> 03:47:17.357
EVEN SPEAK ABOUT OR FILE A

03:47:17.423 --> 03:47:19.792
COMPLAINT AGAINST AN EMPLOYER.

03:47:19.859 --> 03:47:22.695
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW,

03:47:22.762 --> 03:47:23.596
THE AUDIT HAS BEEN GREAT IN

03:47:23.663 --> 03:47:26.299
HELPING US POINT TO EXAMPLES

03:47:26.366 --> 03:47:27.834
WHERE CLEAR LAPSES HAVE

03:47:27.900 --> 03:47:29.702
OCCURRED, BUT A LOT OF THE

03:47:29.769 --> 03:47:32.438
ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED ARE NOT

03:47:32.505 --> 03:47:34.307
REALLY NEW. US AND A LOT OF

03:47:34.374 --> 03:47:35.808
WORKER ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN

03:47:35.875 --> 03:47:37.076
RAISING THESE FOR SEVERAL YEARS,

03:47:37.143 --> 03:47:38.845
AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO COME

03:47:38.911 --> 03:47:39.679
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN

03:47:39.746 --> 03:47:41.114
LEAD TO TANGIBLE RESULTS

03:47:41.180 --> 03:47:43.282
QUICKLY. I THINK ONE OF THE BIG

03:47:43.349 --> 03:47:44.450
EXAMPLES THAT WE BROUGHT UP

03:47:44.517 --> 03:47:45.985
CONSISTENTLY OVER THE LAST FEW

03:47:46.052 --> 03:47:47.587
YEARS IS EXPEDITED HIRING,

03:47:47.653 --> 03:47:48.354
SOMETHING THAT WILL DIRECTLY

03:47:48.421 --> 03:47:50.456
IMPACT AND IMPROVE MOST OF THE

03:47:50.523 --> 03:47:52.358
ISSUES RAISED BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:47:52.425 --> 03:47:54.427
IMPACTED BY INDIVIDUAL WORKLOAD.

03:47:54.494 --> 03:47:55.395
AND I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT

03:47:55.461 --> 03:47:57.797
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IN SPEAKING

03:47:57.864 --> 03:47:58.631
WITH SOME OF THE UNIONS WHO

03:47:58.698 --> 03:47:59.966
REPRESENT WORKERS ACTUALLY

03:48:00.033 --> 03:48:01.367
DOING THIS ENFORCEMENT, THEY

03:48:01.434 --> 03:48:02.735
OFTEN RAISE WORKLOAD AS A

03:48:02.802 --> 03:48:04.103
BARRIER TO MEETING THEIR GOALS.

03:48:04.170 --> 03:48:05.271
AND THE UNDERSTAFFING SLASH

03:48:05.338 --> 03:48:07.306
WORKLOAD ISSUE IS ACTUALLY

03:48:07.373 --> 03:48:09.275
EXACERBATING ITS OWN ISSUES

03:48:09.342 --> 03:48:14.147
BECAUSE AS THE WORKER, THE

03:48:14.213 --> 03:48:15.848
WORKLOAD FOR EACH INDIVIDUALS

03:48:15.915 --> 03:48:17.383
RAISES, IT'S ALSO MORE

03:48:17.450 --> 03:48:20.453
DIFFICULT TO INCREASE RETENTION

03:48:20.520 --> 03:48:23.156
OF THOSE WORKERS, TOO. SO WE

03:48:23.222 --> 03:48:24.557
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE

03:48:24.624 --> 03:48:26.225
NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

03:48:26.292 --> 03:48:27.527
IMPROVE WORKER RETENTION, SO WE

03:48:27.593 --> 03:48:29.295
CAN KEEP THOSE FEW PEOPLE WE

03:48:29.362 --> 03:48:30.329
ACTUALLY DO HAVE IN THOSE JOBS

03:48:30.396 --> 03:48:32.498
WITHOUT LOSING THEM TO SOME

03:48:32.565 --> 03:48:33.332
OTHER POSITIONS OUT IN THE

03:48:33.399 --> 03:48:34.467
INDUSTRY. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

03:48:34.534 --> 03:48:36.202
AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE

03:48:36.269 --> 03:48:37.336
OURSELVES AVAILABLE TO YOU ALL

03:48:37.403 --> 03:48:38.604
AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE

03:48:38.671 --> 03:48:40.473
WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY IN

03:48:40.540 --> 03:48:41.674
CALIFORNIA, THAT WE CAN BE A

03:48:41.741 --> 03:48:42.675
PARTNER IN THAT. THANK YOU.

03:48:42.742 --> 03:48:43.676
THANK YOU, MR. ROSATI.

03:48:43.743 --> 03:48:44.510
APPRECIATE THAT. APPRECIATE YOU

03:48:44.577 --> 03:48:46.279
BEING HERE, MR. KNIGHT. YES.

03:48:46.345 --> 03:48:48.714
GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S AN HONOR

03:48:48.781 --> 03:48:51.184
TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF THIS

03:48:51.250 --> 03:48:52.452
COMMITTEE. STEVEN KNIGHT,

03:48:52.518 --> 03:48:53.386
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH

03:48:53.453 --> 03:48:55.354
WORKSAFE FOR 40 YEARS, FIGHTING

03:48:55.421 --> 03:48:57.857
FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY AND

03:48:57.924 --> 03:48:58.724
EMPOWERMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S

03:48:58.791 --> 03:49:00.193
WORKERS WHO DESERVE THE

03:49:00.259 --> 03:49:02.395
NATION'S BEST WORKER PROTECTION

03:49:02.462 --> 03:49:04.430
AGENCY. AND WITH THE POLITICAL

03:49:04.497 --> 03:49:06.732
WILL FROM THE BACKING OF

03:49:06.799 --> 03:49:09.202
CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS, SAFETY

03:49:09.268 --> 03:49:11.637
AND SAFE AND HEALTHY CONDITIONS

03:49:11.704 --> 03:49:13.606
FOR WORKERS IN OUR STATE ARE A

03:49:13.673 --> 03:49:14.674
CENTRAL INGREDIENT TO AN

03:49:14.740 --> 03:49:17.510
ECONOMY THAT IS GROUNDED IN

03:49:17.577 --> 03:49:19.245
EQUITY AND RESPECT, NOT

03:49:19.312 --> 03:49:21.080
EXPLOITATION. AND HERE'S

03:49:21.147 --> 03:49:22.381
SOMETHING THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME

03:49:22.448 --> 03:49:26.652
FROM THE AUDIT. MORE THAN 4050

03:49:26.719 --> 03:49:28.955
COMPLAINTS ARE FILED EVERY DAY

03:49:29.021 --> 03:49:30.723
COMING INTO CAL-OSHA EVERY DAY

03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:33.659
ACROSS OUR STATE. TWO THIRDS OF

03:49:33.726 --> 03:49:35.194
THE ON SITE INSPECTIONS ARE

03:49:35.261 --> 03:49:37.630
FINDING AT LEAST ONE VIOLATION.

03:49:37.697 --> 03:49:39.699
CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS ARE NOT

03:49:39.765 --> 03:49:41.434
CRYING WOLF. THEY ARE CRYING

03:49:41.501 --> 03:49:44.203
FOR HELP. AND UNFORTUNATELY,

03:49:44.270 --> 03:49:45.404
THE AUDIT LAYS BARE AN AGENCY

03:49:45.471 --> 03:49:47.306
STRUGGLING WITH, QUOTE,

03:49:47.373 --> 03:49:50.376
CRITICAL WEAKNESSES. AS WE'VE

03:49:50.443 --> 03:49:52.612
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS MORNING.

03:49:52.678 --> 03:49:55.348
SO TO BE CLEAR, IT'S NOT

03:49:55.414 --> 03:49:57.683
CALSCI'S JOB TO ENSURE A SAFE

03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:58.417
WORKPLACE. THAT'S THE

03:49:58.484 --> 03:50:00.620
EMPLOYER'S JOB. BUT REGULATION

03:50:00.686 --> 03:50:03.523
AND ENFORCEMENT BY CAL OSHA

03:50:03.589 --> 03:50:05.324
PROVIDES PARAMETERS THAT KEEP

03:50:05.391 --> 03:50:06.159
BUSINESSES FROM SETTLING TO THE

03:50:06.225 --> 03:50:09.295
LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. AND

03:50:09.362 --> 03:50:11.564
AS ELMER'S JUST TALKING ABOUT,

03:50:11.631 --> 03:50:13.299
EMPLOYERS ARE GAMING THE SYSTEM

03:50:13.366 --> 03:50:15.535
AND GETTING AWAY WITH THE COST

03:50:15.601 --> 03:50:17.370
OF DOING BUSINESS. WHAT WE FIND

03:50:17.436 --> 03:50:20.273
WITH OUR PARTNERS IS THAT

03:50:20.339 --> 03:50:22.275
WORKERS HAVE ZERO TRUST THAT

03:50:22.341 --> 03:50:24.143
THEIR NAMES WON'T BE SHARED.

03:50:24.210 --> 03:50:27.380
IT'S SPELLED OUT IN THE AUDIT.

03:50:27.446 --> 03:50:29.448
YOU KNOW, IT'S A FACTOR IN

03:50:29.515 --> 03:50:31.284
WHETHER COMPLAINTS ARE EVEN

03:50:31.350 --> 03:50:33.119
RESPONDED TO IN THE CURRENT

03:50:33.186 --> 03:50:35.721
ENVIRONMENT. WITH ICE RAIDS AND

03:50:35.788 --> 03:50:37.089
THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S

03:50:37.156 --> 03:50:40.426
VIOLATIONS OF OF PRIVACY. THIS

03:50:40.493 --> 03:50:43.095
IS NOT OKAY. FARMWORKERS AND

03:50:43.162 --> 03:50:45.498
OTHER PARTNERS FACE REAL HEALTH

03:50:45.565 --> 03:50:47.733
AND SAFETY CRISES, BUT THEY'RE

03:50:47.800 --> 03:50:49.268
NOT MOTIVATED EVEN TO ENGAGE

03:50:49.335 --> 03:50:51.137
WITH WORKSAFE UNLESS IT'S

03:50:51.204 --> 03:50:53.539
SOMETHING THAT MAKES

03:50:53.606 --> 03:50:54.540
ENFORCEMENT REAL. A GROUP OF

03:50:54.607 --> 03:50:56.475
FARM WORKERS FACING EXTREME

03:50:56.542 --> 03:50:58.411
HEAT LAST YEAR WERE DENIED A

03:50:58.477 --> 03:51:00.146
REST BREAK, TOLD THE TRUCK WAS

03:51:00.213 --> 03:51:03.382
COMING. NO, YOU CAN'T STOP WORK.

03:51:03.449 --> 03:51:05.184
THEY WERE FACING EXTREME

03:51:05.251 --> 03:51:06.719
CONDITIONS. THEY TOOK ACTION

03:51:06.786 --> 03:51:08.020
AND STOPPED TO TAKE REST AND

03:51:08.087 --> 03:51:10.823
THE WHOLE GROUP WAS FIRED

03:51:10.890 --> 03:51:12.491
WITHIN A WEEK. AND AND NO, NO

03:51:12.558 --> 03:51:16.629
COMPLAINT WAS EVER FILED. SO

03:51:16.696 --> 03:51:19.865
JUST TO CALL OUT QUICKLY, THREE

03:51:19.932 --> 03:51:22.068
AREAS OBVIOUSLY LET'S GET FULLY

03:51:22.134 --> 03:51:25.738
STAFFED AND NOT BY ELIMINATING

03:51:25.805 --> 03:51:27.273
POSITIONS SO THAT THEN WE CAN

03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:30.409
IMPROVE THE AGENCY. FROM THERE,

03:51:30.476 --> 03:51:31.210
THE AUDIT CALLS OUT FOR

03:51:31.277 --> 03:51:33.446
BUILDING CAREER PIPELINES.

03:51:33.512 --> 03:51:36.716
RIGHT NOW IN AB 694, THIS

03:51:36.782 --> 03:51:39.418
LEGISLATURE IS ADVANCING A

03:51:39.485 --> 03:51:41.454
REFORM PROPOSAL TO TRY TO HELP

03:51:41.520 --> 03:51:43.389
OPEN UP HIRING. WE HEAR THE

03:51:43.456 --> 03:51:44.690
GOVERNOR TALKING ABOUT BREAKING

03:51:44.757 --> 03:51:46.525
DOWN BARRIERS TO MEET

03:51:46.592 --> 03:51:49.362
CALIFORNIA WORKERS WHERE THEY

03:51:49.428 --> 03:51:50.696
ARE. AND HERE'S A CRITICAL

03:51:50.763 --> 03:51:52.298
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

03:51:52.365 --> 03:51:53.566
COALITION NEEDS TO STAFF TO

03:51:53.633 --> 03:51:55.268
RAMP UP PROGRAM INSPECTIONS. WE

03:51:55.334 --> 03:51:56.569
HAVEN'T HEARD THAT TALKED ABOUT

03:51:56.636 --> 03:52:00.273
THAT MUCH TODAY. JUST GOING OUT

03:52:00.339 --> 03:52:03.075
AND AND NOT WAITING FOR THE

03:52:03.142 --> 03:52:07.113
COMPLAINT TO DO INSPECTIONS AND

03:52:07.179 --> 03:52:09.715
TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE WORK

03:52:09.782 --> 03:52:13.552
THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORTING

03:52:13.619 --> 03:52:15.721
THE MAXIMUM PENALTIES AND

03:52:15.788 --> 03:52:17.523
SUPPORTING THE ENFORCEMENT

03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:20.493
PROCEEDINGS IN COURT. THE AUDIT

03:52:20.559 --> 03:52:22.228
SAYS, QUOTE, LETTER

03:52:22.295 --> 03:52:24.330
INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT A

03:52:24.397 --> 03:52:25.898
SUBSTITUTE FOR ON SITE

03:52:25.965 --> 03:52:26.632
INSPECTIONS, BUT CLEARLY

03:52:26.699 --> 03:52:29.368
THEY'RE BEING TREATED THAT WAY.

03:52:29.435 --> 03:52:31.737
IT'S 80% OF THE OF THE RESPONSE.

03:52:31.804 --> 03:52:34.106
IF THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE

03:52:34.173 --> 03:52:36.275
IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO OVERSEE

03:52:36.342 --> 03:52:38.544
AN AGENCY SENDING AN ENVELOPE

03:52:38.611 --> 03:52:40.279
INSTEAD OF A PERSON TO TO

03:52:40.346 --> 03:52:42.748
CONSTITUTE AN INSPECTION OF A

03:52:42.815 --> 03:52:44.216
LIKELY UNSAFE BUSINESS, THEN

03:52:44.283 --> 03:52:45.851
MORE HAS TO BE DONE TO

03:52:45.918 --> 03:52:47.486
STRENGTHEN THAT PROCESS. AND

03:52:47.553 --> 03:52:49.388
THEN, OF COURSE, THE CLIMATE

03:52:49.455 --> 03:52:52.158
THREATS CAL-OSHA MUST DO MORE

03:52:52.224 --> 03:52:55.561
TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM SMOKE,

03:52:55.628 --> 03:52:57.430
AEROSOL TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES,

03:52:57.496 --> 03:52:59.432
EMERGENCY AND DISASTER CLEANUP

03:52:59.498 --> 03:53:02.168
AND HEAT. LA TIMES JUST CALLED

03:53:02.234 --> 03:53:04.370
OUT THE STATE'S FAILED 20 YEAR

03:53:04.437 --> 03:53:06.205
PROMISE TO PROTECT FARM WORKERS

03:53:06.272 --> 03:53:09.375
FROM HIGH HEAT. SO WE NEED TO

03:53:09.442 --> 03:53:11.210
COMMIT TO STRENGTHEN CAL OSHA

03:53:11.277 --> 03:53:13.779
TO HAVE WORKERS BACKS. WORKERS

03:53:13.846 --> 03:53:15.314
NEED TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTS. THEY

03:53:15.381 --> 03:53:17.717
NEED TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE

03:53:17.783 --> 03:53:19.385
THOSE RIGHTS WITHOUT FEAR OF

03:53:19.452 --> 03:53:21.220
RETRIBUTION, WHICH IS NOT THE

03:53:21.287 --> 03:53:24.390
CASE. AND EMPLOYERS MUST FACE

03:53:24.457 --> 03:53:25.424
CONSEQUENCES FOR ABDICATING

03:53:25.491 --> 03:53:30.296
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU,

03:53:30.363 --> 03:53:33.132
MR. MUTRIE. YES, THE MIC'S

03:53:33.199 --> 03:53:35.968
WORKING. GOOD. I'LL TRY TO BE

03:53:36.035 --> 03:53:37.169
QUICK. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR.

03:53:37.236 --> 03:53:39.305
CHAIR. MEMBERS. APPRECIATE YOU

03:53:39.372 --> 03:53:41.407
BEING HERE. THANK YOU. I DON'T

03:53:41.474 --> 03:53:42.842
THINK THEY'RE HERE, BUT THANK

03:53:42.908 --> 03:53:44.210
YOU TO THE AUDITOR FOR THE WORK

03:53:44.276 --> 03:53:45.344
ON THIS. AND IT'S A VERY

03:53:45.411 --> 03:53:47.580
COMPLICATED TOPIC. OH, GOOD.

03:53:47.646 --> 03:53:50.383
THANK YOU. A BRIEF WAY OF

03:53:50.449 --> 03:53:52.785
BACKGROUND, I AM CAL CHAMBERS,

03:53:52.852 --> 03:53:54.387
LOBBYIST AND ATTORNEY WORKING

03:53:54.453 --> 03:53:55.654
ON WORKPLACE SAFETY ISSUES, AND

03:53:55.721 --> 03:53:57.390
I'VE WORKED WITH CAL OSHA SINCE

03:53:57.456 --> 03:53:59.558
PRE-COVID TIMES ON DRAFTING OF

03:53:59.625 --> 03:54:01.193
A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS, KIND

03:54:01.260 --> 03:54:02.428
OF IN THAT SPACE. AND I'VE

03:54:02.495 --> 03:54:04.096
WORKED WITH SOME OF YOU ON

03:54:04.163 --> 03:54:05.164
LEGISLATION IN THE WORKPLACE

03:54:05.231 --> 03:54:06.766
SAFETY SPACE, NOTABLY SENATOR

03:54:06.832 --> 03:54:07.400
CORTEZ, ON THE WORKPLACE

03:54:07.466 --> 03:54:09.435
VIOLENCE LAW THAT WAS PASSED.

03:54:09.502 --> 03:54:11.370
606A COUPLE OF POINTS I WANT TO

03:54:11.437 --> 03:54:14.273
HIGHLIGHT IN THE IN THE AUDIT

03:54:14.340 --> 03:54:16.308
THAT DIDN'T COME UP. BUT FIRST,

03:54:16.375 --> 03:54:17.910
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, WE

03:54:17.977 --> 03:54:18.544
ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT STAFFING UP.

03:54:18.611 --> 03:54:20.346
JUST EARLIER TODAY, I SPOKE TO

03:54:20.413 --> 03:54:21.614
AN EMPLOYER IN THE CONSTRUCTION

03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:23.315
SPACE WHO SAID TO ME, WE REALLY

03:54:23.382 --> 03:54:25.351
NEED THEM TO STAFF UP SO THEY

03:54:25.418 --> 03:54:26.419
CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:54:26.485 --> 03:54:27.086
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY DOESN'T

03:54:27.153 --> 03:54:27.620
OUTCOMPETE THE LEGITIMATE

03:54:27.686 --> 03:54:28.921
ECONOMY WITH THEIR ENFORCEMENT.

03:54:28.988 --> 03:54:30.489
RIGHT. SO THIS IS NOT A PLACE

03:54:30.556 --> 03:54:32.124
WHERE WE ARE DIVIDED ON THE

03:54:32.191 --> 03:54:33.292
NEEDS. AND I THINK THE

03:54:33.359 --> 03:54:34.293
FUNDAMENTAL FINDINGS OF CAL

03:54:34.360 --> 03:54:36.829
OSHA AND STAFF UP TO BE ITS

03:54:36.896 --> 03:54:38.330
BEST SELF AND DO ITS JOB. I

03:54:38.397 --> 03:54:40.299
ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR, YOU KNOW,

03:54:40.366 --> 03:54:42.201
ABSOLUTELY NOT HERE IN DEFENSE

03:54:42.268 --> 03:54:43.502
OF THE TRAGEDIES WE HEARD ABOUT

03:54:43.569 --> 03:54:44.670
IN WORKPLACE INJURIES WHERE

03:54:44.737 --> 03:54:45.738
THEY OCCUR, CAL-OSHA NEEDS TO

03:54:45.805 --> 03:54:48.007
BE AND NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT.

03:54:48.073 --> 03:54:48.908
THAT HELPS IMPROVE BEHAVIOR.

03:54:48.974 --> 03:54:51.177
ONE POINT THAT CAME OUT IN

03:54:51.243 --> 03:54:52.578
PASSING, I WANT TO CLARIFY IS

03:54:52.645 --> 03:54:54.513
CAME UP IN THE AUDIT AROUND

03:54:54.580 --> 03:54:56.682
PAGE. I WANT TO SAY 47 OF THE

03:54:56.749 --> 03:54:57.950
DOCUMENT. I THINK TOP OF MY

03:54:58.017 --> 03:54:59.151
HEAD RELATES TO THE FUNDING

03:54:59.218 --> 03:55:00.319
STREAM FOR CAL OSHA. I THINK

03:55:00.386 --> 03:55:02.755
THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO A

03:55:02.822 --> 03:55:03.489
COMMENT RAISED BY SENATOR

03:55:03.556 --> 03:55:04.190
SMALLWOOD CUEVAS, WHO'S NO

03:55:04.256 --> 03:55:06.292
LONGER HERE BUT CAL-OSHA

03:55:06.358 --> 03:55:07.593
ENFORCEMENT BRANCH IS FUNDED BY

03:55:07.660 --> 03:55:09.829
AN ASSESSMENT ON EMPLOYERS AND

03:55:09.895 --> 03:55:11.397
HAS BEEN SINCE 2008. THAT IS

03:55:11.464 --> 03:55:12.598
THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND

03:55:12.665 --> 03:55:14.667
HEALTH FUND. IT COMES OUT OF

03:55:14.733 --> 03:55:16.435
WORKERS COMP. THE POINT BEING

03:55:16.502 --> 03:55:17.303
THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

03:55:17.369 --> 03:55:18.471
BUDGET DIPS THERE, THOUGH, IT

03:55:18.537 --> 03:55:19.972
WILL CERTAINLY HAVE SOME

03:55:20.039 --> 03:55:21.507
EFFECTS ON THE AGENCY IN THE

03:55:21.574 --> 03:55:22.708
AGGREGATE, I THINK THAT

03:55:22.775 --> 03:55:23.476
ENFORCEMENT FUNDING IS HANDLED

03:55:23.542 --> 03:55:25.911
SEPARATELY. IS THAT AN Þ?

03:55:25.978 --> 03:55:26.679
THAT'S HIM. SORRY, I THOUGHT I

03:55:26.745 --> 03:55:28.380
WAS ECHOING. SO THAT COMES FROM

03:55:28.447 --> 03:55:29.648
EMPLOYERS RIGHT NOW THAT WHICH

03:55:29.715 --> 03:55:31.650
BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND POINT

03:55:31.717 --> 03:55:32.818
THAT I WANTED TO RAISE THE

03:55:32.885 --> 03:55:34.587
AUDIT FLAGS THAT THE UNFILLED

03:55:34.653 --> 03:55:36.689
POSITIONS FROM CAL OSHA DURING

03:55:36.755 --> 03:55:39.091
THE AUDIT PERIOD SAVED CAL OSHA

03:55:39.158 --> 03:55:41.360
OR EXCUSE ME, HAD A NUMBER

03:55:41.427 --> 03:55:43.596
AROUND $80 MILLION OVER THE

03:55:43.662 --> 03:55:45.831
FIVE YEAR PERIOD THAT WENT

03:55:45.898 --> 03:55:47.433
THEORETICALLY UNSPENT. BUT THE

03:55:47.500 --> 03:55:48.300
AUDIT LOOKED INTO, OKAY, WHERE

03:55:48.367 --> 03:55:50.402
DID THAT MONEY GO? HOW WAS IT

03:55:50.469 --> 03:55:51.670
USED? AND THE AUDIT COULDN'T

03:55:51.737 --> 03:55:53.172
REALLY IDENTIFY THAT DUE TO

03:55:53.239 --> 03:55:54.507
KIND OF RECORD KEEPING ISSUES

03:55:54.573 --> 03:55:56.642
ON CAL OSHA SIDE. OBVIOUSLY, WE

03:55:56.709 --> 03:55:58.177
WOULD LIKE MORE TRANSPARENCY

03:55:58.244 --> 03:55:59.478
THERE, BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT

03:55:59.545 --> 03:56:01.413
THAT MONEY IS BEING TAKEN FROM

03:56:01.480 --> 03:56:02.281
EMPLOYERS AND OSTENSIBLY USED

03:56:02.348 --> 03:56:04.650
TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORKPLACE

03:56:04.717 --> 03:56:06.085
SAFETY GOALS, NOT KNOWING WHERE

03:56:06.151 --> 03:56:07.453
IT GOES IS A LITTLE TROUBLING

03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:09.421
TO US, PARTICULARLY IN A SPACE

03:56:09.488 --> 03:56:11.557
WHERE I THINK THE AUDIT FLAGS.

03:56:11.624 --> 03:56:13.626
NOW, THAT FUND IS BUILT UP A

03:56:13.692 --> 03:56:16.195
SURPLUS OF 220 MILLION. BUT THE

03:56:16.262 --> 03:56:18.597
ASSESSMENT ON EMPLOYERS HAS

03:56:18.664 --> 03:56:19.798
INCREASED BY 20,000,020 MILLION

03:56:19.865 --> 03:56:21.300
A YEAR THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD,

03:56:21.367 --> 03:56:23.736
DESPITE THAT SURPLUS. SO WE

03:56:23.802 --> 03:56:24.303
WOULD JUST ASK FOR A LITTLE

03:56:24.370 --> 03:56:25.771
MORE TRANSPARENCY IN WHERE THAT

03:56:25.838 --> 03:56:27.339
MONEY IS GOING. NOTABLY, THAT

03:56:27.406 --> 03:56:28.607
IS NOT ONE OF THE AUDITS

03:56:28.674 --> 03:56:29.241
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I SAW, BUT

03:56:29.308 --> 03:56:31.443
THAT WOULD BE KIND OF OUR ASK,

03:56:31.510 --> 03:56:33.379
GIVEN THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

03:56:33.445 --> 03:56:34.313
PRESENTLY. I ALSO WANT TO FLAG

03:56:34.380 --> 03:56:36.348
WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THIS,

03:56:36.415 --> 03:56:37.483
THE PUSH TOWARDS MORE

03:56:37.550 --> 03:56:38.317
ELECTRONIC RECORDS. I'VE HAD

03:56:38.384 --> 03:56:39.485
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IN THE

03:56:39.552 --> 03:56:41.353
WORKPLACE SAFETY SPACE SPEAK TO

03:56:41.420 --> 03:56:42.321
ME AND SAY THAT THE LACK OF

03:56:42.388 --> 03:56:43.422
ELECTRONIC RECORD KEEPING

03:56:43.489 --> 03:56:45.357
ACTUALLY MAKES IT HARDER FOR US

03:56:45.424 --> 03:56:46.592
TO RESOLVE AND WORK ON CASES.

03:56:46.659 --> 03:56:48.227
BECAUSE IT'S HARDER TO SHARE

03:56:48.294 --> 03:56:49.428
THE DOCUMENTS, IT'S HARDER TO

03:56:49.495 --> 03:56:50.863
QUICKLY RESOLVE THEM. SO WE'RE

03:56:50.930 --> 03:56:51.397
GLAD THAT THAT IS MOVING

03:56:51.463 --> 03:56:53.966
FORWARD. I KNOW CAL OSHA IS

03:56:54.033 --> 03:56:54.600
WORKING ON IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

03:56:54.667 --> 03:56:55.868
TO ADVISORY COMMITTEES WITH

03:56:55.935 --> 03:56:57.169
THEM ON THAT PROCESS, BUT WE

03:56:57.236 --> 03:56:58.637
HOPE THAT WILL IMPROVE THE

03:56:58.704 --> 03:57:00.072
ENFORCEMENT PROCESS FOR ALL

03:57:00.139 --> 03:57:02.241
SIDES. AND THEN LASTLY, I

03:57:02.308 --> 03:57:03.409
WANTED TO FLAG SOMETHING. I

03:57:03.475 --> 03:57:05.110
THINK CORRECTLY, THERE'S BEEN

03:57:05.177 --> 03:57:06.679
RAISED CONCERNS AROUND THE

03:57:06.745 --> 03:57:08.414
WORKFORCE PIPELINE AND FILLING

03:57:08.480 --> 03:57:09.448
MUCH NEEDED INDUSTRIAL

03:57:09.515 --> 03:57:11.417
HYGIENIST POSITIONS AT CAL OSHA

03:57:11.483 --> 03:57:13.452
TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS. AND

03:57:13.519 --> 03:57:14.386
THERE'S ALSO BEEN CONCERNS

03:57:14.453 --> 03:57:16.322
RAISED ABOUT FEDERAL CHANGES OF

03:57:16.388 --> 03:57:18.157
POLICY AND HOW THAT HAS HURT

03:57:18.223 --> 03:57:19.458
WORKERS BRINGING CLAIMS FORWARD

03:57:19.525 --> 03:57:21.327
AND FEAR. ABSOLUTELY. I THINK

03:57:21.393 --> 03:57:22.628
THAT'S A WELL CONSIDERED

03:57:22.695 --> 03:57:25.331
CONCERN, SOMETHING THAT I KNOW

03:57:25.397 --> 03:57:26.665
CAL OSHA HAS TALKED ABOUT, AND

03:57:26.732 --> 03:57:28.801
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I PUT IN

03:57:28.867 --> 03:57:30.336
FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE

03:57:30.402 --> 03:57:31.537
THE STANDARDS BOARD HAS BEEN

03:57:31.604 --> 03:57:33.305
AWARE OF IT, IS SOME OF THOSE

03:57:33.372 --> 03:57:34.440
FEDERAL CUTS HAVE ALSO MADE IT

03:57:34.506 --> 03:57:36.141
SUCH THAT THE PIPELINES FOR

03:57:36.208 --> 03:57:37.209
INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS, RIGHT,

03:57:37.276 --> 03:57:39.712
HAVE BEEN HARMED. SO YOU NOT

03:57:39.778 --> 03:57:40.412
JUST HAVING HIRING ISSUES

03:57:40.479 --> 03:57:42.281
AROUND RIGHT SHORTAGE IN THE

03:57:42.348 --> 03:57:44.083
MARKET AND PAY ISSUES, WHICH I

03:57:44.149 --> 03:57:45.317
THINK WERE DISCUSSED, BUT THE

03:57:45.384 --> 03:57:47.252
LITERAL PIPELINES THAT TRAIN

03:57:47.319 --> 03:57:48.520
THE PEOPLE TO DO THE THINGS

03:57:48.587 --> 03:57:50.623
THAT WE WANT ARE LOSING FEDERAL

03:57:50.689 --> 03:57:52.157
GRANT FUNDING, MAKING IT EVEN

03:57:52.224 --> 03:57:53.726
HARDER TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS

03:57:53.792 --> 03:57:55.294
IN THIS PRESENT TIME. I KNOW

03:57:55.361 --> 03:57:57.663
CAL OES IS AWARE OF THAT. IT'S

03:57:57.730 --> 03:57:58.263
BEEN DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT,

03:57:58.330 --> 03:58:00.099
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT

03:58:00.165 --> 03:58:01.367
SOLUTION IS, EXCEPT FOR

03:58:01.433 --> 03:58:02.101
CALIFORNIA FINDING FUNDING TO

03:58:02.167 --> 03:58:03.702
TO HELP WITH THOSE PIPELINES.

03:58:03.769 --> 03:58:04.503
OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFICULT, BUT I

03:58:04.570 --> 03:58:06.372
WANTED TO FLAG THAT SINCE I

03:58:06.438 --> 03:58:08.107
THINK A COUPLE OF THE COMMENTS

03:58:08.173 --> 03:58:09.241
TOUCHED ON IT TANGENTIALLY, BUT

03:58:09.308 --> 03:58:11.176
DIDN'T REALLY BRING IT TOGETHER.

03:58:11.243 --> 03:58:13.212
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR. THANK

03:58:13.278 --> 03:58:14.480
YOU TO ALL THREE OF YOU. I'M

03:58:14.546 --> 03:58:16.148
NOW GOING TO HAND IT OVER TO

03:58:16.215 --> 03:58:17.282
CHAIRWOMAN ORTEGA FOR ANY

03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:18.517
QUESTIONS TO START US OFF.

03:58:18.584 --> 03:58:20.452
YOU'RE OKAY? ANY QUESTIONS? MR.

03:58:20.519 --> 03:58:23.088
CORRE, I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS

03:58:23.155 --> 03:58:26.291
GRATITUDE TO POINTING OUT THE

03:58:26.358 --> 03:58:28.994
FACT THAT WE'RE NOT DOING

03:58:29.061 --> 03:58:30.496
ENOUGH FOR WORKERS AND TO THE

03:58:30.562 --> 03:58:34.433
POINTS THAT WERE MADE.

03:58:34.500 --> 03:58:37.403
REGARDING ENSURING, LIKE MR.

03:58:37.469 --> 03:58:39.204
KNIGHT WAS TALKING ABOUT 40, 50

03:58:39.271 --> 03:58:41.273
COMPLAINTS A DAY. WE KNOW

03:58:41.340 --> 03:58:42.541
THAT'S WAY LOWER THAN THE

03:58:42.608 --> 03:58:44.309
ACTUAL NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT

03:58:44.376 --> 03:58:46.645
ARE OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY,

03:58:46.712 --> 03:58:49.181
ESPECIALLY NOW GIVEN THE THE

03:58:49.248 --> 03:58:51.050
ATTACK ON OUR IMMIGRANT

03:58:51.116 --> 03:58:54.286
COMMUNITY AND ALSO AFTER SO

03:58:54.353 --> 03:58:57.456
MANY YEARS OF NOT BEING

03:58:57.523 --> 03:58:59.291
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF

03:58:59.358 --> 03:59:00.526
WORKERS, WORKERS ARE GOING TO

03:59:00.592 --> 03:59:01.427
STOP FILING COMPLAINTS BECAUSE

03:59:01.493 --> 03:59:02.828
THEY DON'T SEE AN OUTCOME

03:59:02.895 --> 03:59:04.296
THAT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL

03:59:04.363 --> 03:59:06.331
TO THEM, AND THEY DON'T WANT TO

03:59:06.398 --> 03:59:08.434
RISK RETALIATION. AND SO WE

03:59:08.500 --> 03:59:10.202
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

03:59:10.269 --> 03:59:12.438
HAVING AND NOT JUST ACCURATE

03:59:12.504 --> 03:59:14.440
NUMBERS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE

03:59:14.506 --> 03:59:15.240
HAVE WORKERS THAT ARE FEELING

03:59:15.307 --> 03:59:17.376
EMPOWERED TO DO THE RIGHT JOB

03:59:17.443 --> 03:59:19.211
OR DO THE RIGHT THING AND AND

03:59:19.278 --> 03:59:22.347
FEEL SUPPORTED IN DOING THAT.

03:59:22.414 --> 03:59:23.682
AND TO MR. MUCHA, I APPRECIATE

03:59:23.749 --> 03:59:26.285
YOU BEING HERE. IT IT'S GREAT

03:59:26.351 --> 03:59:27.653
TO HEAR IN A HEARING LIKE THIS

03:59:27.720 --> 03:59:29.188
THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE

03:59:29.254 --> 03:59:30.289
RECOMMENDATIONS, WHAT HAVE YOU.

03:59:30.355 --> 03:59:31.724
BUT THEN WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE

03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:33.158
POLICY BILLS OR BUDGET ITEMS TO

03:59:33.225 --> 03:59:34.393
HAVE THE CHAMBER OPPOSE, I HAVE

03:59:34.460 --> 03:59:36.462
A BILL RIGHT NOW ON FOREIGN

03:59:36.528 --> 03:59:37.196
LABOR CONTRACTORS TO HELP

03:59:37.262 --> 03:59:38.363
EMPOWER THEM AND INFORM THEM ON

03:59:38.430 --> 03:59:39.631
THE RIGHTS. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

03:59:39.698 --> 03:59:41.667
IS INFORMAL. OPPOSITION HAS

03:59:41.734 --> 03:59:43.235
BEEN SINCE 2018, WHICH IS THE

03:59:43.302 --> 03:59:44.503
FIRST TIME I INTRODUCED THAT

03:59:44.570 --> 03:59:46.505
BILL. WE DO. I'VE DONE BILLS ON

03:59:46.572 --> 03:59:48.340
BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. I CAN COUNT

03:59:48.407 --> 03:59:50.576
NUMEROUS BILLS. AND I GUESS THE

03:59:50.642 --> 03:59:53.011
COINED THE TERM USED TO BE JOB

03:59:53.078 --> 03:59:53.779
KILLER. NOW IT'S AFFORDABILITY,

03:59:53.846 --> 03:59:55.647
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. BUT WHAT

03:59:55.714 --> 03:59:57.616
MIGHT BE MORE HELPFUL IS FOR

03:59:57.683 --> 03:59:58.417
THE CHAMBER TO ACTUALLY STOP

03:59:58.484 --> 03:59:59.485
OPPOSING EVERY SINGLE TIME WE

03:59:59.551 --> 04:00:01.653
DO ANY EFFORT TO TRY TO STAND

04:00:01.720 --> 04:00:05.557
UP AND EMPOWER OUR WORKERS TO

04:00:05.624 --> 04:00:08.393
HAVE A FORMAL OPPOSITION WHERE

04:00:08.460 --> 04:00:09.328
IT MATTERS THE MOST, WHICH IS

04:00:09.394 --> 04:00:10.529
WHEN WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

04:00:10.596 --> 04:00:12.765
GET POLICY BILLS PASSED AND

04:00:12.831 --> 04:00:14.433
WHEN WE TRY TO ACTUALLY PUSH ON

04:00:14.500 --> 04:00:16.869
HIRING AND PUSH FOR FUNDING IN

04:00:16.935 --> 04:00:19.671
THOSE AREAS, TO ACTUALLY HAVE

04:00:19.738 --> 04:00:21.707
FORMAL PUBLIC SUPPORT FROM THE

04:00:21.774 --> 04:00:22.274
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WHEN WE

04:00:22.341 --> 04:00:25.978
MAKE THOSE PUSHES, AS OPPOSED

04:00:26.044 --> 04:00:28.781
TO WHEN BUDGETS ARE BEING

04:00:28.847 --> 04:00:30.082
DISCUSSED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

04:00:30.149 --> 04:00:31.049
OF TRYING TO SQUASH THOSE

04:00:31.116 --> 04:00:34.620
EFFORTS. FEEL FREE TO RESPOND

04:00:34.686 --> 04:00:37.222
IF YOU'D LIKE. YEAH, IF I CAN

04:00:37.289 --> 04:00:38.390
JUST RESPOND BRIEFLY, I. I

04:00:38.457 --> 04:00:40.092
DON'T MEAN TO MISSTATE OUR

04:00:40.159 --> 04:00:42.194
POSITIONS. I, I WOULD SEPARATE

04:00:42.261 --> 04:00:44.363
SUPPORTING FOR CAL OSHA USING

04:00:44.429 --> 04:00:45.931
THE MONEY THEY ALREADY HAVE IN

04:00:45.998 --> 04:00:47.566
A MASSIVE SURPLUS IN THAT FUND

04:00:47.633 --> 04:00:50.202
TO HIRE IS WHAT I INTEND TO

04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:51.303
EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR IMPROVING

04:00:51.370 --> 04:00:52.437
THEIR PRACTICES. I DON'T MEAN

04:00:52.504 --> 04:00:54.173
TO BE DISHONEST ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

04:00:54.239 --> 04:00:55.340
PRIOR POSITIONS WHERE WE'VE

04:00:55.407 --> 04:00:56.441
OPPOSED BILLS THAT CHANGE

04:00:56.508 --> 04:00:58.076
STANDARDS OR CHANGE LAWS AROUND

04:00:58.143 --> 04:00:59.444
SPACES, AND I MEAN TO SEPARATE

04:00:59.511 --> 04:01:00.612
THOSE FROM HIRING AND STAFFING.

04:01:00.679 --> 04:01:02.314
SO I DON'T MEAN TO BE DISHONEST

04:01:02.381 --> 04:01:04.149
IN THAT. YOU MENTIONED THE

04:01:04.216 --> 04:01:06.084
FEDERAL ISSUES, WHICH I THINK

04:01:06.151 --> 04:01:07.052
EVERYONE'S ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

04:01:07.119 --> 04:01:08.720
THEY'RE THEY'RE CUTTING BACK ON

04:01:08.787 --> 04:01:09.521
TRAINING. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

04:01:09.588 --> 04:01:10.556
CUTTING BACK ON WORKER

04:01:10.622 --> 04:01:12.157
PROTECTIONS. I HAVE A BILL

04:01:12.224 --> 04:01:14.092
RIGHT NOW ON FOREIGN LABOR

04:01:14.159 --> 04:01:14.993
CONTRACTS INFORMING THEM OF

04:01:15.060 --> 04:01:16.795
THEIR RIGHTS, NOT CREATING NEW

04:01:16.862 --> 04:01:18.864
RIGHTS. AND IT'S BEING STRONGLY

04:01:18.931 --> 04:01:20.465
OPPOSED BY THE CHAMBER OF

04:01:20.532 --> 04:01:22.167
COMMERCE. SO I JUST WANT TO PUT

04:01:22.234 --> 04:01:23.435
THAT OUT THERE ON THE RECORD

04:01:23.502 --> 04:01:26.038
THAT IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT.

04:01:26.104 --> 04:01:27.005
OH YEAH, WE SUPPORT THE

04:01:27.072 --> 04:01:27.639
RECOMMENDATIONS, WHAT HAVE YOU.

04:01:27.706 --> 04:01:29.541
BUT WHEN THEN THE NEXT DAY A

04:01:29.608 --> 04:01:31.577
BILL IS BEING PRESENTED BY ONE

04:01:31.643 --> 04:01:33.378
OF US TO DO EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

04:01:33.445 --> 04:01:34.646
TALKING ABOUT HERE, TO FURTHER

04:01:34.713 --> 04:01:36.782
EMPOWER WORKERS IN THE CHAMBER

04:01:36.849 --> 04:01:39.117
OPPOSES. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO

04:01:39.184 --> 04:01:43.488
HEAR TO HEAR BOTH SIDES OF, OF

04:01:43.555 --> 04:01:45.357
OF THAT ARGUMENT WHEN IT WOULD

04:01:45.424 --> 04:01:47.459
BE NICE IF WE ACTUALLY HIT.

04:01:47.526 --> 04:01:48.360
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WHEN IT

04:01:48.427 --> 04:01:51.997
COMES TO EVEN JUST INFORMING

QUESTION FOR MR. MØT. AND THIS

04:02:13.118 --> 04:02:18.390
IS. REALLY KIND OF MAYBE

04:02:18.457 --> 04:02:20.158
EXTRANEOUS AND VOLUNTARY. BUT,

04:02:20.225 --> 04:02:22.427
YOU KNOW, ONE OF ONE OF THE

04:02:22.494 --> 04:02:23.228
THINGS THAT REALLY WORKS THE

04:02:23.295 --> 04:02:25.364
BEST, COMING FROM BOTH A

04:02:25.430 --> 04:02:27.332
BUSINESS AND AND FARMING

04:02:27.399 --> 04:02:29.268

04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:39.678
ENCOURAGEMENT WITHIN THE

INDUSTRY FOR PEOPLE TO COMPLY.

04:02:41.246 --> 04:02:43.348
AND I'M REALLY JUST USE THE

04:02:43.415 --> 04:02:44.583
EXAMPLE OF HEAT ILLNESS VERY

04:02:44.650 --> 04:02:46.151
QUICKLY. WE DON'T NEED TO TAKE

04:02:46.218 --> 04:02:48.220
A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS. BUT IT

04:02:48.287 --> 04:02:49.855
BASICALLY THE LAW BASICALLY

04:02:49.922 --> 04:02:52.224
SAYS PROVIDE SHADE AND WATER.

04:02:52.291 --> 04:02:54.459
IF YOU'RE AN ORCHARD FARMER,

04:02:54.526 --> 04:02:57.229
YOU YOU ALREADY HAVE HALF OF IT

04:02:57.296 --> 04:02:59.097
COVERED BECAUSE THE SHADE'S

04:02:59.164 --> 04:03:01.233
ALREADY THERE. YOU NEED WATER.

04:03:01.300 --> 04:03:03.435
AND YOU KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE

04:03:03.502 --> 04:03:06.204
SEEING AT TIMES. I MEAN, BASED

04:03:06.271 --> 04:03:07.973
ON SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE WORK

04:03:08.040 --> 04:03:09.441
I'VE DONE 40% NONCOMPLIANCE. OF

04:03:09.508 --> 04:03:12.177
COURSE, OSHA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE

04:03:12.244 --> 04:03:13.111
TO GET OUT THERE AND DOCUMENT

04:03:13.178 --> 04:03:14.413
WHAT THOSE NUMBERS PROBABLY

04:03:14.479 --> 04:03:16.315
ACTUALLY ARE AT THE MOMENT.

04:03:16.381 --> 04:03:17.482
MAYBE THAT'S A LITTLE HIGHER OR

04:03:17.549 --> 04:03:19.217
WHATEVER. WHAT IF IT WAS HALF

04:03:19.284 --> 04:03:21.486
OF THAT 20%? YOU KNOW, THERE'S

04:03:21.553 --> 04:03:23.188
THERE'S AN ASSOCIATION FOR

04:03:23.255 --> 04:03:24.456
EVERYTHING THAT PRUNE GROWERS,

04:03:24.523 --> 04:03:26.291
YOU KNOW, THE CO-OPS, THE

04:03:26.358 --> 04:03:28.393
SUNSWEET, YOU KNOW, THE CATTLE

04:03:28.460 --> 04:03:29.594
RAISERS ASSOCIATION. MY

04:03:29.661 --> 04:03:32.230
FAMILY'S PART OF THAT. IT GOES

04:03:32.297 --> 04:03:34.566
A LONG WAY. IF, YOU KNOW, I'M

04:03:34.633 --> 04:03:36.134
NOT PUTTING THIS ALL IN THE

04:03:36.201 --> 04:03:37.402
CHAMBER, BUT ON YOUR PARTNERS,

04:03:37.469 --> 04:03:39.504
YOU KNOW, SORT OF ON THE ON THE

04:03:39.571 --> 04:03:42.674
NASCAR LETTER TEAM, YOU KNOW,

04:03:42.741 --> 04:03:45.110
COULDN'T MORE BE DONE JUST ON

04:03:45.177 --> 04:03:46.745
AN ISSUE LIKE THAT TO SAY, HEY,

04:03:46.812 --> 04:03:48.513
LOOK, YOU KNOW, TO HEAD OFF

04:03:48.580 --> 04:03:49.581
LEGISLATION THAT'S, THAT'S

04:03:49.648 --> 04:03:51.316
EITHER TRYING TO INCREASE

04:03:51.383 --> 04:03:53.085
PENALTIES OR DO WORKAROUNDS ON,

04:03:53.151 --> 04:03:55.787
ON OSHA TO ASK FOR WORKERS COMP

04:03:55.854 --> 04:03:58.156
CHANGES IN AREAS LIKE THIS.

04:03:58.223 --> 04:04:00.325
FOLKS, WE CAN WE CAN END THIS

04:04:00.392 --> 04:04:03.128
RIGHT NOW BY, YOU KNOW, JUST

04:04:03.195 --> 04:04:05.430
INCREASING COMPLIANCE. AND I

04:04:05.497 --> 04:04:08.500
THINK THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE

04:04:08.567 --> 04:04:13.538
97% GOOD ACTOR CATEGORY ON MOST

04:04:13.605 --> 04:04:15.407
ISSUES WOULD COME AROUND, YOU

04:04:15.474 --> 04:04:16.308
KNOW, BUT AGAIN, THE THE

04:04:16.375 --> 04:04:18.443
PRESSURE ON THOSE WHO WOULD

04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:21.079
COMPLY IF IT, IF IT'S ONLY 60%

04:04:21.146 --> 04:04:24.416
ON THE, ON THE 40% THAT'S NOT

04:04:24.483 --> 04:04:25.183
COMPLYING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:27.552
THEY'RE REALLY, REALLY CREATING

04:04:27.619 --> 04:04:30.122
A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE IN THE

04:04:30.188 --> 04:04:31.990
LEGISLATURE, YOU KNOW, LET

04:04:32.057 --> 04:04:34.159
ALONE, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, IN

04:04:34.226 --> 04:04:36.261
TERMS OF EVERYTHING FROM

04:04:36.328 --> 04:04:37.329
SERIOUS INJURY, STROKE,

04:04:37.396 --> 04:04:38.397
FATALITIES AND SO FORTH, WHICH

04:04:38.463 --> 04:04:40.399
IS A REAL CONCERN. BUT BUT JUST

04:04:40.465 --> 04:04:42.401
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S AN ANGLE

04:04:42.467 --> 04:04:43.702
THERE TO JUST SAY, HEY, LET'S

04:04:43.769 --> 04:04:45.404
NOT HAVE A BILL LIKE THIS THIS

04:04:45.470 --> 04:04:46.605
YEAR, YOU KNOW, NEXT YEAR

04:04:46.671 --> 04:04:48.340
BECAUSE WE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE

04:04:48.407 --> 04:04:50.709
IMPROVED THESE NUMBERS. CAN CAN

04:04:50.776 --> 04:04:52.310
YOU DO THAT. YEAH, I MEAN I CAN,

04:04:52.377 --> 04:04:54.479
I CAN WHAT I CAN SAY ON THAT IS

04:04:54.546 --> 04:04:56.148
I APPRECIATE YOU FLAGGING THAT,

04:04:56.214 --> 04:04:57.249
YOU KNOW, THE MAJORITY OF

04:04:57.315 --> 04:04:58.750
EMPLOYERS ARE NOT DOING THAT.

04:04:58.817 --> 04:05:00.152
BUT OBVIOUSLY ANY CASES THAT IS

04:05:00.218 --> 04:05:01.386
TOO MUCH. I WAS INVOLVED IN THE

04:05:01.453 --> 04:05:03.655
INDOOR HEAT REGULATION AND SOME

04:05:03.722 --> 04:05:04.923
OF THE TAIL END OF THE OUTDOOR

04:05:04.990 --> 04:05:06.058
HEAT REGULATION DRAFTING. I

04:05:06.124 --> 04:05:07.526
CAN'T SPEAK TO INDIVIDUAL

04:05:07.592 --> 04:05:09.294
EMPLOYERS FAILURES. YOU KNOW,

04:05:09.361 --> 04:05:10.495
OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT IN THE FIELD

04:05:10.562 --> 04:05:12.230
ON THOSE, AND I DON'T PRETEND

04:05:12.297 --> 04:05:14.466
TO BE. WHAT I CAN SAY IS WE PUT

04:05:14.533 --> 04:05:15.734
OUT TRAINING MATERIALS ON THOSE

04:05:15.801 --> 04:05:17.269
PIECES. I'VE DONE WEBINARS ON

04:05:17.335 --> 04:05:18.570
THOSE PIECES. WE CERTAINLY TAKE

04:05:18.637 --> 04:05:20.405
PART IN TRYING TO SPREAD THAT

04:05:20.472 --> 04:05:22.441
INFORMATION AND THE PENETRATION

04:05:22.507 --> 04:05:24.409
RATE OF THAT INFORMATION INTO

04:05:24.476 --> 04:05:25.377
THE FIELD, RIGHT, IS CERTAINLY

04:05:25.444 --> 04:05:27.312
A PROBLEM THAT WAY. THERE HAVE

04:05:27.379 --> 04:05:29.448
BEEN THERE HAVE BEEN BILLS ON

04:05:29.514 --> 04:05:30.315
THINGS LIKE HER CALL THIS WAS

04:05:30.382 --> 04:05:32.451
LAST YEAR, BUT BILLS ON

04:05:32.517 --> 04:05:33.418
TRANSLATING INFORMATIONAL

04:05:33.485 --> 04:05:34.820
MATERIALS INTO MORE LANGUAGES,

04:05:34.886 --> 04:05:35.454
MAKING THEM MORE AVAILABLE. YOU

04:05:35.520 --> 04:05:37.122
KNOW, WE DON'T OPPOSE THAT IN

04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:39.091
ANY WAY. WE'RE NOT HERE TO STOP

04:05:39.157 --> 04:05:40.425
THAT. AND IF THERE'S WAYS THAT

04:05:40.492 --> 04:05:42.094
WE CAN HELP SPREAD THAT, YOU

04:05:42.160 --> 04:05:43.161
KNOW, GLAD TO, BECAUSE

04:05:43.228 --> 04:05:44.296
OBVIOUSLY I AGREE WITH YOU,

04:05:44.362 --> 04:05:45.564
THAT KIND OF FAILURE RATE IS

04:05:45.630 --> 04:05:47.799
NOT GOOD, RIGHT? IT'S NOT

04:05:47.866 --> 04:05:48.366
SOMETHING WE WANT. IT'S NOT

04:05:48.433 --> 04:05:49.434
SOMETHING WE DEFEND. YEAH. I

04:05:49.501 --> 04:05:51.770
THINK THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY IN

04:05:51.837 --> 04:05:53.171
THE IN THE BROAD SENSE. I HOPE

04:05:53.238 --> 04:05:54.873
THAT'S RESPONSIVE. IT IS

04:05:54.940 --> 04:05:56.174
SOMEWHAT. BUT I'M NOT TALKING

04:05:56.241 --> 04:05:58.243
ABOUT INCREASING AWARENESS ON

04:05:58.310 --> 04:06:00.145
THE EMPLOYEE SIDE SO THAT WE

04:06:00.212 --> 04:06:01.279
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

04:06:01.346 --> 04:06:03.782
COMPLAINTS. I'M TALKING ABOUT.

04:06:03.849 --> 04:06:05.117
ABC FARMS IS IN COMPLIANCE.

04:06:05.183 --> 04:06:07.319
THEY'RE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO XYZ

04:06:07.385 --> 04:06:08.553
FARMS. THEY'RE IN THE SAME

04:06:08.620 --> 04:06:10.222
PRUNE GROWERS ASSOCIATION HERE

04:06:10.288 --> 04:06:13.058
IN YUBA CITY. THOSE FOLKS

04:06:13.125 --> 04:06:14.493
SHOULD BE HAVING A CONVERSATION,

04:06:14.559 --> 04:06:16.628
I THINK SPEARHEADED BY THE

04:06:16.695 --> 04:06:18.363
THIRD HOUSE, SPEARHEADED BY

04:06:18.430 --> 04:06:21.266
FOLKS UP HERE WHO ARE IN THESE

04:06:21.333 --> 04:06:23.535
HEARINGS, LIKE, LIKE YOUR

04:06:23.602 --> 04:06:25.203
ORGANIZATION SAYING, YOU KNOW,

04:06:25.270 --> 04:06:26.505
LETTING THEM KNOW. I'D LOVE TO

04:06:26.571 --> 04:06:28.206
SEE EVIDENCE OF THAT. I WON'T

04:06:28.273 --> 04:06:30.809
GO AS FAR AS MY MY EXCELLENT

04:06:30.876 --> 04:06:32.144
COLLEAGUE, ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND

04:06:32.210 --> 04:06:34.246
ASKED FOR THE SUPPORT POSITION

04:06:34.312 --> 04:06:36.081
ON THIS BILL, ALTHOUGH I WOULD

04:06:36.148 --> 04:06:38.283
ENCOURAGE THAT TOO. BUT, YOU

04:06:38.350 --> 04:06:40.318
KNOW, I MEAN, I THINK IT COULD

04:06:40.385 --> 04:06:41.319
GO A LONG WAY JUST TO START

04:06:41.386 --> 04:06:43.188
COPYING THE LEGISLATURE ON

04:06:43.255 --> 04:06:44.823
CORRESPONDENCE, YOU KNOW, TO TO

04:06:44.890 --> 04:06:46.324

04:06:46.391 --> 04:06:49.528
TO THEM THAT THIS IS A CRISIS

04:06:49.594 --> 04:06:52.564
THAT CAN BE AVERTED, REALLY,

04:06:52.631 --> 04:06:56.268
WITH JUST BASIC COMPLIANCE AND

04:06:56.334 --> 04:06:57.802
THAT THERE SHOULD BE PEER

04:06:57.869 --> 04:06:59.471
PRESSURE TO COMPLY. IT HAPPENS

04:06:59.538 --> 04:07:01.239
IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. I KNOW

04:07:01.306 --> 04:07:02.774
I'VE BEEN ON APARTMENT

04:07:02.841 --> 04:07:04.142
ASSOCIATION BOARDS WHERE ALL OF

04:07:04.209 --> 04:07:05.377
A SUDDEN SOME FOLKS START

04:07:05.443 --> 04:07:07.479
RAMPING UP EVICTIONS IN A TIGHT

04:07:07.546 --> 04:07:09.181
HOUSING MARKET. YOU KNOW WHAT

04:07:09.247 --> 04:07:10.382
HAPPENS? EVERY OTHER LANDLORD

04:07:10.448 --> 04:07:12.484

04:07:12.551 --> 04:07:14.619
ON THOSE FOLKS AND SAY, DON'T

04:07:14.686 --> 04:07:17.022
DO THAT. WE ARE A LITTLE TIRED

04:07:17.088 --> 04:07:19.324
OF BEING ON THE 6:00 NEWS. AND

04:07:19.391 --> 04:07:21.560
AND BESIDES THAT, PEOPLE ARE

04:07:21.626 --> 04:07:23.128
GETTING HURT BY IT. SO IT'S

04:07:23.195 --> 04:07:25.397
JUST I'M NOT POLLYANNA, I GET

04:07:25.463 --> 04:07:27.432
IT. I'M NOT NAIVE. I UNDERSTAND

04:07:27.499 --> 04:07:29.334
THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT,

04:07:29.401 --> 04:07:31.169
BUT I'D CERTAINLY LOVE TO SEE

04:07:31.236 --> 04:07:33.772

AND I KNOW WE'RE UP AGAINST THE

04:07:41.279 --> 04:07:42.447
CLOCK, SO I'LL BE BRIEF. YOU

04:07:42.514 --> 04:07:44.382
KNOW, I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT

04:07:44.449 --> 04:07:46.484
WHAT WE'VE THE CONVERSATION

04:07:46.551 --> 04:07:47.953
WE'VE BEEN HAVING THROUGHOUT

04:07:48.019 --> 04:07:50.188
TODAY. AND THERE WAS SOMETHING

04:07:50.255 --> 04:07:53.325
THAT WAS SAID BY MR. IS THAT

04:07:53.391 --> 04:07:55.460
HOW I PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME?

04:07:55.527 --> 04:07:56.361
SORRY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

04:07:56.428 --> 04:07:58.230
YEAH. MU TREE LIKE COW TREE.

04:07:58.296 --> 04:08:00.498
YEAH. MR. TREE, WHICH IS YOU

04:08:00.565 --> 04:08:02.701
KNOW, THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER

04:08:02.767 --> 04:08:05.437
OF EMPLOYERS WHO ARE COMPLYING.

04:08:05.503 --> 04:08:07.272
AND I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF

04:08:07.339 --> 04:08:09.441
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT REVAMPING

04:08:09.507 --> 04:08:12.644
WORKER'S COMP. BUT IN THIS

04:08:12.711 --> 04:08:14.613
PROCESS, YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING,

04:08:14.679 --> 04:08:17.582
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE END OF THE

04:08:17.649 --> 04:08:18.483
PIPELINE IN TERMS OF WORKERS.

04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:20.185
WHY DON'T WE START AT THE

04:08:20.252 --> 04:08:21.953
BEGINNING? AND PART OF WHAT'S

04:08:22.020 --> 04:08:23.888
NOT HAPPENING IS HOLDING

04:08:23.955 --> 04:08:24.389
EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE,

04:08:24.456 --> 04:08:28.326
ESPECIALLY REPEAT VIOLATORS. I

04:08:28.393 --> 04:08:30.228
BELIEVE THAT ONCE WE START

04:08:30.295 --> 04:08:32.430
TAKING THEM SERIOUSLY AND AND

04:08:32.497 --> 04:08:34.499
THESE INJURIES AND DEATHS

04:08:34.566 --> 04:08:36.801
SERIOUSLY, AND WE START HOLDING

04:08:36.868 --> 04:08:38.236
THEM ACCOUNTABLE, JUST LIKE WE

04:08:38.303 --> 04:08:40.438
WOULD A DRUNK DRIVER WHO KILLS

04:08:40.505 --> 04:08:43.875
THREE PEOPLE, THEN BEHAVIOR

04:08:43.942 --> 04:08:45.277
WILL START TO CHANGE. AND

04:08:45.343 --> 04:08:47.045
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING THAT

04:08:47.112 --> 04:08:50.048
WE'LL GET TO EVENTUALLY THROUGH.

04:08:50.115 --> 04:08:52.017
THIS PROCESS IS REALLY STARTING

04:08:52.083 --> 04:08:54.352
TO HOLD SOME OF THESE EMPLOYERS

04:08:54.419 --> 04:08:57.155
ACCOUNTABLE, ESPECIALLY THE

04:08:57.222 --> 04:08:59.624
EXAMPLE THAT I STARTED OUT WITH

04:08:59.691 --> 04:09:00.859
THIS MORNING OR EARLIER TODAY

04:09:00.925 --> 04:09:02.794
IN MY COUNTY, IN MY AREA WHERE

04:09:02.861 --> 04:09:05.463
I REPRESENT IN THE CITY THAT I

04:09:05.530 --> 04:09:07.666
LIVE IN, YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T

04:09:07.732 --> 04:09:09.868
ONE DEATH, IT WASN'T TWO DEATHS,

04:09:09.934 --> 04:09:12.771
IT WASN'T IT WAS THREE, THREE

04:09:12.837 --> 04:09:15.173
DEATHS. AND I STILL DON'T HAVE

04:09:15.240 --> 04:09:19.010
AN ANSWER AS TO HOW MANY DEATHS

04:09:19.077 --> 04:09:20.512
IT WILL TAKE FOR AN EMPLOYER TO

04:09:20.578 --> 04:09:24.482
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. YOU KNOW?

04:09:24.549 --> 04:09:26.418
SO I'LL CONCLUDE WITH JUST

04:09:26.484 --> 04:09:28.586
SAYING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE

04:09:28.653 --> 04:09:30.155
AND AND HIGHLIGHTING THE WORKER

04:09:30.221 --> 04:09:31.589
PERSPECTIVE AND ACKNOWLEDGING

04:09:31.656 --> 04:09:33.325
ALL THE ALL THE WORK THAT HAS

04:09:33.391 --> 04:09:35.360
BEEN DONE ON THE STAFFING ISSUE.

04:09:35.427 --> 04:09:37.128
I DON'T WANT TO OVERLOOK THE

04:09:37.195 --> 04:09:38.530
FACT THAT THERE ARE WORKERS WHO

04:09:38.596 --> 04:09:41.399
ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO HOLD,

04:09:41.466 --> 04:09:43.768
YOU KNOW, 20 MILLION WORKERS IN

04:09:43.835 --> 04:09:46.871
THE STATE, YOU KNOW, TO KEEP

04:09:46.938 --> 04:09:48.273
THEM SAFE. AND THEY'RE DOING

04:09:48.340 --> 04:09:50.442
THE BEST THAT THEY CAN. YOU

04:09:50.508 --> 04:09:52.644
KNOW, AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER, I

04:09:52.711 --> 04:09:55.146
AM RESPONSIBLE AND I WORK FOR A

04:09:55.213 --> 04:09:56.748
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WHO SENT

04:09:56.815 --> 04:09:59.117
ME HERE. AND I BELIEVE THAT

04:09:59.184 --> 04:10:00.385
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO

04:10:00.452 --> 04:10:02.787
HAPPEN ARE STRUCTURAL, AND THEY

04:10:02.854 --> 04:10:05.290
HAVE TO START AT THE TOP. AND

04:10:05.357 --> 04:10:07.258
THAT INCLUDES US AS LEGISLATORS

04:10:07.325 --> 04:10:09.160
REALLY THINKING ABOUT AND

04:10:09.227 --> 04:10:11.429
LOOKING AT REFORM. SO I WILL BE

04:10:11.496 --> 04:10:13.131
LOOKING AT THE CRIMINAL ASPECT

04:10:13.198 --> 04:10:15.266
OF THIS AND THE CRIMINAL

04:10:15.333 --> 04:10:17.369
REFERRALS. AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

04:10:17.435 --> 04:10:20.872
THE REDUCTION OF FINES. I'M

04:10:20.939 --> 04:10:22.507
REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT

04:10:22.574 --> 04:10:24.275
THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING, THOSE

04:10:24.342 --> 04:10:25.543
TWO THINGS WERE NOT AT THE TOP

04:10:25.610 --> 04:10:27.278
OF THE LIST OF THINGS WE NEED

04:10:27.345 --> 04:10:30.615
TO DO TODAY, WHICH IS STOP

04:10:30.682 --> 04:10:33.318
REDUCING FINES AND START

04:10:33.385 --> 04:10:35.387
INCREASING CRIMINAL REFERRALS

04:10:35.453 --> 04:10:40.158
FOR THOSE TWO THINGS. THANK YOU.

04:10:40.225 --> 04:10:42.394
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR, AND

04:10:42.460 --> 04:10:45.263
THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR BEING

04:10:45.330 --> 04:10:46.464
HERE. I WANT TO THANK YOU,

04:10:46.531 --> 04:10:48.066
GENTLEMEN, FOR CONCLUDING OUR

04:10:48.133 --> 04:10:50.268
LAST PANEL. I'M NOW GOING TO

04:10:50.335 --> 04:10:51.569
OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

04:10:51.636 --> 04:10:53.238
IF ANYONE HAS A PUBLIC COMMENT,

04:10:53.304 --> 04:10:54.506
PLEASE LINE UP IN FRONT OF THE

04:10:54.572 --> 04:10:56.074
MICROPHONE. IF YOU COULD KEEP

04:10:56.141 --> 04:10:57.876
YOUR COMMENT TO ONE MINUTE,

04:10:57.942 --> 04:10:58.843
THAT WOULD BE GREAT JUST GIVEN

04:10:58.910 --> 04:11:00.412
THE TIMING. AND ONCE WE RECEIVE

04:11:00.478 --> 04:11:02.814
ALL THE PUBLIC COMMENTS, WE

04:11:02.881 --> 04:11:04.382
WILL CLOSE. SO THANK YOU. THANK

04:11:04.449 --> 04:11:05.750
YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK

04:11:05.817 --> 04:11:07.252
HERE. I BELIEVE THIS IS AN

04:11:07.318 --> 04:11:09.154
URGENT MATTER IN LIGHT OF

04:11:09.220 --> 04:11:10.455
NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. MY NAME

04:11:10.522 --> 04:11:11.289
IS JEFF ELLSWORTH. I'M THE

04:11:11.356 --> 04:11:13.558
FORMER MAYOR OF SAINT HELENA,

04:11:13.625 --> 04:11:14.359
NAPA COUNTY, MEMBER OF

04:11:14.426 --> 04:11:15.627
CALIFORNIA, LULAC, THE LEAGUE

04:11:15.693 --> 04:11:17.395
OF UNITED LATIN AMERICAN

04:11:17.462 --> 04:11:18.997
CITIZENS, WHICH IS THE OLDEST

04:11:19.063 --> 04:11:20.532
AND LARGEST HISPANIC CIVIL

04:11:20.598 --> 04:11:22.400
RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN AMERICA.

04:11:22.467 --> 04:11:24.202
I SUPPORT EFFORTS WITH THESE

04:11:24.269 --> 04:11:25.470
AUDITS TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY

04:11:25.537 --> 04:11:27.272
TO THESE MATTERS, INCLUDING

04:11:27.338 --> 04:11:28.740
WITH ADDITIONAL STAFFING,

04:11:28.807 --> 04:11:29.340
FUNDING, AND ENFORCEMENT. OVER

04:11:29.407 --> 04:11:31.743
THE LAST YEARS, I'VE PRESENTED

04:11:31.810 --> 04:11:32.944
A NUMEROUS STATE AGENCIES ABOUT

04:11:33.011 --> 04:11:34.145
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH

04:11:34.212 --> 04:11:36.347
IMPACTS TO LATINO WORKERS AT

04:11:36.414 --> 04:11:37.682
UPPER VALLEY DISPOSAL SERVICE

04:11:37.749 --> 04:11:39.684
AND CLOVER FLAT LANDFILL IN

04:11:39.751 --> 04:11:41.419
NAPA COUNTY, INCLUDING

04:11:41.486 --> 04:11:43.488
SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO TOXIC

04:11:43.555 --> 04:11:45.757
WASTE WATER, FIRES, SMOKE,

04:11:45.824 --> 04:11:46.458
UNREGULATED RADIOACTIVE WASTE

04:11:46.524 --> 04:11:48.693
AND A LATINO WORKER FATALITY.

04:11:48.760 --> 04:11:50.495
THAT PERSON, THAT HUMAN BEING,

04:11:50.562 --> 04:11:52.130
WAS CUT IN HALF, DISMEMBERED BY

04:11:52.197 --> 04:11:54.966
A GARBAGE TRUCK. RECENT DEATHS

04:11:55.033 --> 04:11:56.167
OF MORE LATINO WORKERS AT OTHER

04:11:56.234 --> 04:11:57.202
WASTE COMPANIES IN THE SAN

04:11:57.268 --> 04:11:59.137
FRANCISCO BAY AREA SINCE THE

04:11:59.204 --> 04:12:00.839
BEGINNING OF 2025 INDICATES A

04:12:00.905 --> 04:12:03.608
TRAGICALLY SYSTEMIC PROBLEM

04:12:03.675 --> 04:12:05.076
WITH WASTE. COMPANIES THAT ARE

04:12:05.143 --> 04:12:06.811
OPERATING OPERATING UNDER

04:12:06.878 --> 04:12:08.513
DIRECT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

04:12:08.580 --> 04:12:10.248
AND SO I THINK THIS IS AN AREA

04:12:10.315 --> 04:12:12.951
WHERE THERE IS A LEVER WITH

04:12:13.017 --> 04:12:13.518
COMPANIES THAT ARE OPERATING

04:12:13.585 --> 04:12:14.152
WITH GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. I'M

04:12:14.219 --> 04:12:16.688
GOING TO MOVE OFF THE MIC HERE

04:12:16.754 --> 04:12:19.891
TO GIVE OTHERS TIME, BUT THE

04:12:19.958 --> 04:12:21.226
WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE

04:12:21.292 --> 04:12:22.360
SELF-EVIDENT WITH WASTE

04:12:22.427 --> 04:12:23.161
COMPANIES PROFITING UNDER

04:12:23.228 --> 04:12:25.263
DIRECT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS,

04:12:25.330 --> 04:12:27.432
THAT THE MANDATE WOULD BE TO

04:12:27.499 --> 04:12:28.466
MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST STANDARDS

04:12:28.533 --> 04:12:30.768
OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND PUBLIC

04:12:30.835 --> 04:12:32.237
SAFETY. BUT THIS IS NOT

04:12:32.303 --> 04:12:34.472
HAPPENING IN LIGHT OF NATIONAL

04:12:34.539 --> 04:12:36.241
EVENTS. THE COMMITMENT TO CIVIL

04:12:36.307 --> 04:12:38.343
RIGHTS IS UP TO ALL OF US AND

04:12:38.409 --> 04:12:40.478
EACH OF US, ON A DAY TO DAY

04:12:40.545 --> 04:12:42.213
BASIS, AT A BOARD LEVEL, AT A

04:12:42.280 --> 04:12:44.048
STAFF LEVEL AND A PERSONAL

04:12:44.115 --> 04:12:44.549
LEVEL. IT'S ALL OF OUR

04:12:44.616 --> 04:12:46.117
RESPONSIBILITY. SO TIED INTO

04:12:46.184 --> 04:12:47.352
THESE WORKER SAFETY ISSUES ARE

04:12:47.418 --> 04:12:49.287
CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES THAT I

04:12:49.354 --> 04:12:50.388
BELIEVE WE MUST ALL STAND

04:12:50.455 --> 04:12:53.324
TOGETHER NOW AS WE LOOK AT WHAT

04:12:53.391 --> 04:12:54.292
IS HAPPENING NATIONALLY. I

04:12:54.359 --> 04:12:58.029
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU,

04:12:58.096 --> 04:12:59.497
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. MIKE

04:12:59.564 --> 04:13:01.299
MONNING, ON BEHALF OF THE STATE

04:13:01.366 --> 04:13:02.367
BUILDING TRADES, I WANT TO

04:13:02.433 --> 04:13:04.235
THANK CHAIR ORTEGA AND THE

04:13:04.302 --> 04:13:07.105
STATE AUDITOR AND HIS STAFF FOR

04:13:07.171 --> 04:13:08.206
AN EXCELLENT REPORT. SADLY, IT

04:13:08.273 --> 04:13:10.375
WASN'T DONE FIVE YEARS AGO OR

04:13:10.441 --> 04:13:12.911
TEN YEARS AGO OR EVEN 20 YEARS

04:13:12.977 --> 04:13:14.212
AGO. I WAS THE LABOR MEMBER OF

04:13:14.279 --> 04:13:16.648
THE CAL OSHA APPEALS BOARD 40

04:13:16.714 --> 04:13:19.851
YEARS AGO, AND AT THAT TIME,

04:13:19.918 --> 04:13:22.253
DER WAS UNDERFUNDED. CAL OSHA

04:13:22.320 --> 04:13:24.322
WAS UNDERFUNDED AND

04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:25.423
UNDERSTAFFED, AND NOTHING HAS

04:13:25.490 --> 04:13:26.991
CHANGED. IN FACT, IT'S GOTTEN

04:13:27.058 --> 04:13:29.727
WORSE. THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT

04:13:29.794 --> 04:13:32.196
IS A LETTER IN LIEU OF AN

04:13:32.263 --> 04:13:33.865
INSPECTION. I MEAN, THAT'S

04:13:33.932 --> 04:13:36.501
HORRIBLE. IT'S THAT'S NO WAY

04:13:36.568 --> 04:13:37.502
THAT'S A GOOD SUBSTITUTE FOR

04:13:37.569 --> 04:13:39.571
WORKER SAFETY. SO I WISH YOU

04:13:39.637 --> 04:13:41.406
ALL WELL IN GETTING MORE FUNDS

04:13:41.472 --> 04:13:43.541
FOR THE PROGRAMS, BECAUSE IT'S

04:13:43.608 --> 04:13:45.310
NOT ONLY JUST CAL OSHA NEED

04:13:45.376 --> 04:13:47.345
MORE MONEY FOR THE LABOR

04:13:47.412 --> 04:13:49.847
COMMISSIONER STAFF AND MORE

04:13:49.914 --> 04:13:53.618
INSPECTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK

04:13:53.685 --> 04:13:55.386
YOU, CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME

04:13:55.453 --> 04:13:56.654
IS JB HANNA, LEGISLATIVE

04:13:56.721 --> 04:13:58.089
ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA

04:13:58.156 --> 04:13:59.724
NURSES ASSOCIATION,

04:13:59.791 --> 04:14:00.592
REPRESENTING OVER 100,000

04:14:00.658 --> 04:14:01.159
REGISTERED NURSES ACROSS THE

04:14:01.225 --> 04:14:04.062
STATE. CNA APPRECIATES THE WORK

04:14:04.128 --> 04:14:05.396
OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND

04:14:05.463 --> 04:14:06.297
THIS COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE CAL

04:14:06.364 --> 04:14:08.333
OSHA'S PROCESSES AND INSPECTION

04:14:08.399 --> 04:14:09.233
DATA TO DETERMINE HOW WELL THE

04:14:09.300 --> 04:14:11.235
AGENCY IS PROTECTING WORKERS.

04:14:11.302 --> 04:14:13.705
ALSO, THE RESULTS OF THIS AUDIT

04:14:13.771 --> 04:14:14.706
ARE UNFORTUNATELY DISAPPOINTING

04:14:14.772 --> 04:14:16.374
BUT NOT SURPRISING. CALOSHA

04:14:16.441 --> 04:14:18.343
LEADS THE NATION WHEN IT COMES

04:14:18.409 --> 04:14:19.611
TO HEALTHCARE WORKER SAFETY. WE

04:14:19.677 --> 04:14:20.445
HAVE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE

04:14:20.511 --> 04:14:21.913
STANDARDS ON WORKPLACE VIOLENCE

04:14:21.980 --> 04:14:23.748
PREVENTION, SAFE PATIENT

04:14:23.815 --> 04:14:24.382
HANDLING AND THE ONLY STANDARD

04:14:24.449 --> 04:14:26.317
ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES. YET

04:14:26.384 --> 04:14:28.353
CNAS MEMBERS HAVE LONG

04:14:28.419 --> 04:14:29.087
EXPERIENCED CHALLENGES

04:14:29.153 --> 04:14:30.355
INTERFACING WITH CAL OSHA TO

04:14:30.421 --> 04:14:32.924
ENFORCE HEALTH AND SAFETY

04:14:32.991 --> 04:14:33.424
STANDARDS IN HEALTHCARE

04:14:33.491 --> 04:14:35.226
FACILITIES AS THEY CARE FOR

04:14:35.293 --> 04:14:36.494
THEIR PATIENTS AT THE BEDSIDE.

04:14:36.561 --> 04:14:37.662
MANY OF THE ISSUES NAMED IN

04:14:37.729 --> 04:14:39.330
THIS AUDIT CHALLENGES GETTING

04:14:39.397 --> 04:14:40.632
COMPLAINTS PROCESSED IN A

04:14:40.698 --> 04:14:41.466
TIMELY FASHION. CHALLENGES

04:14:41.532 --> 04:14:42.233
GETTING CAL OSHA TO SEND AN

04:14:42.300 --> 04:14:44.202
INSPECTOR TO DO AN ON SITE

04:14:44.268 --> 04:14:45.470
INSPECTION. WHEN CAL OSHA DOES

04:14:45.536 --> 04:14:47.271
DO AN ON SITE INSPECTION, WE'VE

04:14:47.338 --> 04:14:48.339
EXPERIENCED RESISTANCE AND EVEN

04:14:48.406 --> 04:14:50.375
REFUSAL FROM INSPECTORS TO

04:14:50.441 --> 04:14:51.376
INTERVIEW MEMBERS, EVEN WHEN

04:14:51.442 --> 04:14:52.744
THE UNION LINES UP THOSE NURSES

04:14:52.810 --> 04:14:54.278
WITH KEY INSIGHTS. CHALLENGES

04:14:54.345 --> 04:14:56.514
WITH ABATEMENT AFTER A CITATION,

04:14:56.581 --> 04:14:57.382
ESPECIALLY WHERE AN EMPLOYER

04:14:57.448 --> 04:14:59.550
APPEALS AND A NURSE, NURSES

04:14:59.617 --> 04:15:01.252
OFTEN HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME

04:15:01.319 --> 04:15:04.355
FOR AN ABATEMENT TO HAPPEN. CNA

04:15:04.422 --> 04:15:05.423
AFFIRMS THAT THE

04:15:05.490 --> 04:15:06.324
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT

04:15:06.391 --> 04:15:08.426
ARE AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP TO

04:15:08.493 --> 04:15:09.093
REVITALIZING THE AGENCY,

04:15:09.160 --> 04:15:10.194
ESPECIALLY THAT THE

04:15:10.261 --> 04:15:12.363
RECOMMENDATIONS TO SYSTEMIZE

04:15:12.430 --> 04:15:13.631
CAL POLICIES FOR INSPECTORS TO

04:15:13.698 --> 04:15:15.199
PROVIDE THEIR RATIONALES FOR

04:15:15.266 --> 04:15:17.335
DECISIONS MADE AT EVERY STEP OF

04:15:17.402 --> 04:15:19.203
THE COMPLAINT AND INSPECTION

04:15:19.270 --> 04:15:20.538
PROCESS, FROM RECEIVING AND

04:15:20.605 --> 04:15:21.305
CLASSIFYING THE COMPLAINT TO

04:15:21.372 --> 04:15:23.141
WHAT TYPE OF INSPECTION AND HOW

04:15:23.207 --> 04:15:24.342
LONG THEY HAVE TO OPEN IT. HOW

04:15:24.409 --> 04:15:26.444
TO CONDUCT THE INSPECTION,

04:15:26.511 --> 04:15:27.612
INTERVIEWING WORKERS, ISSUING

04:15:27.679 --> 04:15:29.681
CITATIONS AND FINES, AND

04:15:29.747 --> 04:15:31.315
VERIFYING ABATEMENT. IT'S

04:15:31.382 --> 04:15:32.216
ESSENTIAL FOR WORKERS TO BE

04:15:32.283 --> 04:15:34.652
ABLE TO RELY ON THE AGENCY TO

04:15:34.719 --> 04:15:35.653
PROVIDE CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT

04:15:35.720 --> 04:15:37.522
AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO

04:15:37.588 --> 04:15:38.456
REMEDY UNDERSTAFFING CHALLENGES

04:15:38.523 --> 04:15:40.425
THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE AGENCY.

04:15:40.491 --> 04:15:42.226
WE WOULD ALSO ADD THAT WHEN CAL

04:15:42.293 --> 04:15:44.062
OSHA UPDATES ITS POLICIES, IT

04:15:44.128 --> 04:15:45.630
SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR MECHANISM

04:15:45.697 --> 04:15:47.498
FOR RETRAINING ALL INSPECTORS

04:15:47.565 --> 04:15:48.633
IN THE UPDATED POLICY AND

04:15:48.700 --> 04:15:51.235
CHANGES TO THE PROCEDURES. MANY

04:15:51.302 --> 04:15:52.537
WORKERS ARE HESITANT TO ENGAGE

04:15:52.603 --> 04:15:53.671
WITH CAL OSHA BECAUSE THEY

04:15:53.738 --> 04:15:55.273
DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL GET THE

04:15:55.339 --> 04:15:57.308
HELP THEY NEED, AND SPEAKING UP

04:15:57.375 --> 04:15:59.110
CAN BE RISKY, ESPECIALLY FOR

04:15:59.177 --> 04:16:00.178
NONUNION WORKERS. CONSISTENCY

04:16:00.244 --> 04:16:01.312
AND RESPONSIVENESS ARE KEY TO

04:16:01.379 --> 04:16:03.548
REBUILDING THAT TRUST, AND IT'S

04:16:03.614 --> 04:16:05.316
PAST TIME FOR CAL OSHA TO TAKE

04:16:05.383 --> 04:16:07.885
DECISIVE ACTION TO REMEDY THE

04:16:07.952 --> 04:16:08.519
STAFFING AND SYSTEMIC

04:16:08.586 --> 04:16:09.353
CHALLENGES IN WHICH THE AGENCY

04:16:09.420 --> 04:16:11.489
IS MIRED. AGAIN, WANT TO

04:16:11.556 --> 04:16:12.724
REITERATE OUR EXTREME GRATITUDE

04:16:12.790 --> 04:16:14.525

MITCH STEIGER WITH CFT, A UNION

04:18:39.704 --> 04:18:40.705
OF EDUCATORS AND CLASSIFIED

04:18:40.771 --> 04:18:41.405
PROFESSIONALS, APPRECIATE THE

04:18:41.472 --> 04:18:42.673
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY.

04:18:42.740 --> 04:18:44.775
WE VERY MUCH APPLAUD YOU ALL

04:18:44.842 --> 04:18:45.376
FOR HAVING THIS HEARING. IT'S

04:18:45.443 --> 04:18:47.378
LONG OVERDUE. THIS IS A PROBLEM

04:18:47.445 --> 04:18:49.280
THAT'S BEEN AT THE CRISIS LEVEL

04:18:49.347 --> 04:18:52.283
FOR DECADES. AND IT'S TRUE, AS

04:18:52.350 --> 04:18:53.484
EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD TODAY

04:18:53.551 --> 04:18:55.186
IS, WHAT YOU'VE HEARD REALLY IS

04:18:55.253 --> 04:18:57.255
THE TIP OF A MUCH, MUCH LARGER

04:18:57.321 --> 04:18:58.289
ICEBERG. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO

04:18:58.356 --> 04:19:00.358
THIS KIND OF WORK FOR VERY LONG

04:19:00.424 --> 04:19:01.559
TO REALIZE THAT THIS SYSTEM

04:19:01.626 --> 04:19:03.327
REALLY ISN'T WORKING FOR MOST

04:19:03.394 --> 04:19:04.595
WORKERS. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

04:19:04.662 --> 04:19:05.563
FOR A LONG TIME. I'VE NEVER

04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:07.498
ONCE TALKED TO A WORKER WHO HAD

04:19:07.565 --> 04:19:08.733
AN EXPERIENCE WITH OSHA, WHERE

04:19:08.799 --> 04:19:10.268
THE PROCESS WORKED THE WAY IT

04:19:10.334 --> 04:19:11.836
WAS SUPPOSED TO. SO WE VERY

04:19:11.903 --> 04:19:13.004
MUCH APPRECIATE YOU

04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.638
HIGHLIGHTING ALL OF THESE

04:19:13.704 --> 04:19:15.273
ISSUES. AND WHILE THERE ARE A

04:19:15.339 --> 04:19:17.341
LOT OF ISSUES AND THEY DO GO

04:19:17.408 --> 04:19:18.609
BEYOND STAFFING, WE WOULD

04:19:18.676 --> 04:19:19.443
REALLY HIGHLIGHT STAFFING AS

04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:21.479
ONE OF THE KEY PLACES, IF NOT

04:19:21.545 --> 04:19:23.147
THE KEY PLACE, WHERE ALL OF

04:19:23.214 --> 04:19:24.382
THESE OTHER PROBLEMS STEM FROM.

04:19:24.448 --> 04:19:26.350
WHEN YOU'RE A WORKER AND YOU'RE

04:19:26.417 --> 04:19:28.219
TRYING TO DO 3 OR 4 PEOPLE'S

04:19:28.286 --> 04:19:29.587
JOBS AT ONCE, YOU DON'T HAVE

04:19:29.654 --> 04:19:31.789
ANY CHOICE BUT TO CUT CORNERS.

04:19:31.856 --> 04:19:33.291
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

04:19:33.357 --> 04:19:34.458
DO THE THOROUGH REPORT THAT

04:19:34.525 --> 04:19:35.693
YOU'D LIKE TO DO. YOU'RE NOT

04:19:35.760 --> 04:19:37.228
GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUT

04:19:37.295 --> 04:19:38.863
EVERYTHING IN THE NOTES THAT

04:19:38.930 --> 04:19:39.630
YOU SHOULD. SOME THINGS ARE

04:19:39.697 --> 04:19:41.332
GOING TO GO TO A LETTER

04:19:41.399 --> 04:19:42.433
INVESTIGATION WHEN THEY SHOULD

04:19:42.500 --> 04:19:44.035
GO TO AN IN-PERSON INSPECTION.

04:19:44.101 --> 04:19:45.136
ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEN RESULT

04:19:45.202 --> 04:19:46.237
DIRECTLY FROM THE FACT THAT

04:19:46.304 --> 04:19:47.505
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH

04:19:47.571 --> 04:19:49.173
WORK AT ONCE. AND FOR ONCE.

04:19:49.240 --> 04:19:50.541
THIS IS NOT A MONEY PROBLEM.

04:19:50.608 --> 04:19:52.777
THE MONEY IS THERE. THE OSHA

04:19:52.843 --> 04:19:53.945
ASSESSMENT BRINGS IN MORE THAN

04:19:54.011 --> 04:19:55.279
ENOUGH MONEY TO TO STAFF UP TO

04:19:55.346 --> 04:19:57.448
DO AN ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM,

04:19:57.515 --> 04:19:58.616
TO DO EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO.

04:19:58.683 --> 04:20:00.785
SO WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO THE

04:20:00.851 --> 04:20:02.053
BOTTOM OF WHERE THE FINANCIAL

04:20:02.119 --> 04:20:03.321
ISSUES ARE, AND WE NEED TO GET

04:20:03.387 --> 04:20:05.456
TO THE BOTTOM OF WHERE THE

04:20:05.523 --> 04:20:06.324
STAFFING ISSUES ARE AND ADDRESS

04:20:06.390 --> 04:20:08.192
THOSE. THERE IS A BILL BEFORE

04:20:08.259 --> 04:20:09.393
YOU, AB 694 BY MISS MCKENNA.

04:20:09.460 --> 04:20:11.395
THAT IS A BIG STEP TOWARDS

04:20:11.462 --> 04:20:12.229
SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. THE BILL

04:20:12.296 --> 04:20:13.331
IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. THE

04:20:13.397 --> 04:20:14.732
BILL SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BECOME

04:20:14.799 --> 04:20:16.267
LAW AND IT WOULD DO A LOT TO

04:20:16.334 --> 04:20:18.202
HELP THIS PROBLEM. FINALLY, WE

04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:20.104
WOULD ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT A LOT

04:20:20.171 --> 04:20:21.038
OF COMMENTS TODAY REFLECTED THE

04:20:21.105 --> 04:20:23.274
REDUCED APPEALS OR SORRY, THE

04:20:23.341 --> 04:20:24.842
REDUCED FINE AMOUNTS BECAUSE OF

04:20:24.909 --> 04:20:26.243
APPEALS. AND THAT'S VERY MUCH A

04:20:26.310 --> 04:20:28.312
REAL PROBLEM. BUT IT'S A

04:20:28.379 --> 04:20:29.080
PROBLEM BECAUSE THE LAW

04:20:29.146 --> 04:20:30.348
REQUIRES THAT WHEN YOU LOOK IN

04:20:30.414 --> 04:20:32.483
THE LABOR CODE, THERE IS A LONG

04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:34.118
LIST OF THINGS THAT REQUIRE THE

04:20:34.185 --> 04:20:35.219
FINE TO BE REDUCED FOR A

04:20:35.286 --> 04:20:36.420
VARIETY, AND IN A VERY

04:20:36.487 --> 04:20:38.489
COMPLICATED AND HARD TO PARSE

04:20:38.556 --> 04:20:40.224
THROUGH WAY OF WHEN WHEN

04:20:40.291 --> 04:20:41.325
CAL-OSHA AND THE APPEALS BOARD

04:20:41.392 --> 04:20:42.693
IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THE FINE

04:20:42.760 --> 04:20:44.628
LESS THAN IT SHOULD BE. AND AS

04:20:44.695 --> 04:20:46.897
A RESULT, THERE ARE ALL SORTS

04:20:46.964 --> 04:20:47.365
OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT

04:20:47.431 --> 04:20:48.366
EMPLOYERS CAN GRIND THE PROCESS

04:20:48.432 --> 04:20:50.468
TO A HALT WHEN THEY REALLY WANT

04:20:50.534 --> 04:20:52.737
TO. THEY CAN MAKE IT TAKE A LOT

04:20:52.803 --> 04:20:54.205
LONGER THAN IT SHOULD, AND MOST

04:20:54.271 --> 04:20:55.740
IMPORTANTLY, THEY DON'T HAVE TO

04:20:55.806 --> 04:20:56.674
ABATE THE HAZARD WHILE THEY'RE

04:20:56.741 --> 04:20:57.441
ENGAGED IN THAT APPEAL. SO

04:20:57.508 --> 04:20:59.744
WHATEVER IT IS, THE SAU WITHOUT

04:20:59.810 --> 04:21:00.578
A GUARD, THE NO SCAFFOLDING,

04:21:00.644 --> 04:21:02.213
THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR, IT CAN

04:21:02.279 --> 04:21:04.181
JUST KEEP GOING THE WHOLE TIME

04:21:04.248 --> 04:21:05.082
DURING THAT APPEAL PROCESS. SO

04:21:05.149 --> 04:21:06.283
THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO IN

04:21:06.350 --> 04:21:08.619
ADDITION TO TAKING A HARD LOOK

04:21:08.686 --> 04:21:09.453
AT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT WAYS

04:21:09.520 --> 04:21:11.122
THAT APPEAL, THAT FINES CAN BE

04:21:11.188 --> 04:21:12.456
REDUCED AND THAT AN EMPLOYER

04:21:12.523 --> 04:21:14.425
WHO REALLY WANTS TO GUM UP THE

04:21:14.492 --> 04:21:16.227
SYSTEM CAN. AND WITH ALL OF

04:21:16.293 --> 04:21:17.461
THOSE THINGS, IF WE TAKE A

04:21:17.528 --> 04:21:18.662
MEANINGFUL STEP TOWARDS SOLVING

04:21:18.729 --> 04:21:20.331
THOSE, WE COULD DO A LOT TO

04:21:20.398 --> 04:21:22.666
MAKING SURE THAT THE FINES LOOK

04:21:22.733 --> 04:21:24.001
THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD. BUT

04:21:24.068 --> 04:21:24.535
OVERALL, IT WAS A REALLY

04:21:24.602 --> 04:21:26.537
HELPFUL HEARING AND WE APPLAUD

04:21:26.604 --> 04:21:28.172

04:21:28.239 --> 04:21:29.273
YOU. THANK YOU. AND FOR WE HAVE

04:21:29.340 --> 04:21:31.776
A NUMBER OF FOLKS LEFT. WE WE

04:21:31.842 --> 04:21:33.144
DO WELCOME WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS

04:21:33.210 --> 04:21:34.545
ON ANY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

04:21:34.612 --> 04:21:36.614
AS WELL. I THINK IT WOULD BE

04:21:36.680 --> 04:21:37.381
HELPFUL FOR OUR COMMITTEE AND

04:21:37.448 --> 04:21:39.183
AND THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES

04:21:39.250 --> 04:21:40.718
INVOLVED HERE. SO THANK YOU.

04:21:40.785 --> 04:21:41.719
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT.

04:21:41.786 --> 04:21:43.788

GARRETT BROWN. I WORKED FOR CAL

04:29:03.827 --> 04:29:04.361
WE'VE HEARD MANY THINGS THAT

04:29:04.428 --> 04:29:05.395
ARE HAPPENING. WE HOPE THOSE

04:29:05.462 --> 04:29:08.031
CONTINUE AT FULL SPEED, IF NOT

04:29:08.098 --> 04:29:10.167
FASTER. HOWEVER, WE ALSO KNOW,

04:29:10.234 --> 04:29:11.435
BASED ON DECADES OF PRIOR

04:29:11.502 --> 04:29:12.669
EXPERIENCE, THAT THE AGENCY

04:29:12.736 --> 04:29:14.338
SIMPLY CAN'T DO THIS WORK ALONE.

04:29:14.404 --> 04:29:16.440

DOING IS PARTNERING. THERE IS,

04:29:23.313 --> 04:29:25.115
FORTUNATELY, A NEW SOLUTION ON

04:29:25.182 --> 04:29:27.384
THE TABLE. I WANT TO ECHO

04:29:27.451 --> 04:29:29.286
SUPPORT FOR AB 694, WHICH IS

04:29:29.353 --> 04:29:30.687
CURRENTLY IN THE LEGISLATOR

04:29:30.754 --> 04:29:31.688
LEGISLATURE. IT'S A MUCH NEEDED

04:29:31.755 --> 04:29:33.790
SOLUTION TO DESIGN A FIRST OF

04:29:33.857 --> 04:29:34.725
ITS KIND RECRUITMENT, TRAINING

04:29:34.791 --> 04:29:37.261
AND PIPELINE PROGRAM FOR

04:29:37.327 --> 04:29:38.328
DIVERSE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE

04:29:38.395 --> 04:29:40.497
PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS TO

04:29:40.564 --> 04:29:41.798
BECOME SAFETY INSPECTOR

04:29:41.865 --> 04:29:43.800
CANDIDATES. SO NOT JUST, YOU

04:29:43.867 --> 04:29:45.168
KNOW, KIND OF GOING TO COLLEGES,

04:29:45.235 --> 04:29:46.436
ETC. AND TRYING TO COME FROM

04:29:46.503 --> 04:29:49.039
THE SAME RECRUITMENT POOL, BUT

04:29:49.106 --> 04:29:50.207
REALLY A MUCH WIDER RECRUITMENT

04:29:50.274 --> 04:29:52.109
POOL THAN WE HAVEN'T SEEN

04:29:52.175 --> 04:29:54.511
BEFORE. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED

04:29:54.578 --> 04:29:55.479
BY OVER 50 WORKER ADVOCACY

04:29:55.546 --> 04:29:56.547
ORGANIZATIONS AND UNIONS THAT

04:29:56.613 --> 04:29:58.148
ARE READY AND WILLING TO

04:29:58.215 --> 04:29:59.283
PARTNER TO RECRUIT NEW WORKERS

04:29:59.349 --> 04:30:01.485
INTO THE PIPELINE. CAL OSHA

04:30:01.552 --> 04:30:02.653
SAYS THAT THEY RELY ON

04:30:02.719 --> 04:30:04.221
PARTNERSHIP APPROACH IN THEIR

04:30:04.288 --> 04:30:05.389
CURRENT RECRUITMENT EFFORTS,

04:30:05.455 --> 04:30:07.057
AND AB 604 WOULD WOULD REALLY

04:30:07.124 --> 04:30:09.259
FORMALIZE AND SCALE THAT

04:30:09.326 --> 04:30:10.794
APPROACH. SO WE REALLY

04:30:10.861 --> 04:30:12.262
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

04:30:12.329 --> 04:30:16.533
REALLY PASS AB 694 AND DER AND

04:30:16.600 --> 04:30:18.235
MOST IMPORTANTLY, DER TO

04:30:18.302 --> 04:30:20.938
PARTNER WITH LABOR UNIONS AND

04:30:21.004 --> 04:30:21.538
WORKER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS

04:30:21.605 --> 04:30:23.206
ACROSS THE STATE TO REALLY

04:30:23.273 --> 04:30:24.541
BUILD OUT THAT NEW PROGRAM. SO

04:30:24.608 --> 04:30:25.842
THAT IS ONE DIFFERENT SOLUTION

04:30:25.909 --> 04:30:27.444
THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING CURRENTLY

04:30:27.511 --> 04:30:29.846

04:30:29.913 --> 04:30:32.883

SHORT. OUR ORGANIZATION IS

04:30:45.629 --> 04:30:47.130
FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT

04:30:47.197 --> 04:30:48.165
ALL WORKPLACE INJURIES,

04:30:48.231 --> 04:30:49.199
ILLNESSES AND DEATHS ARE

04:30:49.266 --> 04:30:50.467
PREVENTABLE. TODAY, WE APPLAUD

04:30:50.534 --> 04:30:52.169
THE AUDITOR FOR CAPTURING AND

04:30:52.235 --> 04:30:53.870
HIGHLIGHTING THE BARRIERS.

04:30:53.937 --> 04:30:55.472
THANK YOU. AND HIGHLIGHTING THE

BARRIERS WORKING PEOPLE FACE ON

04:30:56.740 --> 04:30:58.175
A DAILY BASIS AND POINTING

04:30:58.241 --> 04:30:59.376
TOWARDS SOLUTIONS WHICH INCLUDE

04:30:59.443 --> 04:31:00.410
EMPHASIZING THE CRITICAL NEED

04:31:00.477 --> 04:31:02.212
FOR PROPER STAFFING AT CAL OSHA,

04:31:02.279 --> 04:31:04.348
A CONCERN WE'VE LONG CHAMPIONED

04:31:04.414 --> 04:31:05.315
FOR THE SAKE OF WORKER HEALTH

04:31:05.382 --> 04:31:08.285
AND SAFETY. THE CHALLENGES AS

04:31:08.352 --> 04:31:10.420
WE ARE MUTATING AS WE SPEAK. I

04:31:10.487 --> 04:31:11.421
SPOKE WITH THE EMPLOYEE THIS

04:31:11.488 --> 04:31:13.724
WEEK, AND THEY NOTED THAT

04:31:13.790 --> 04:31:14.491
WORKING PEOPLE ARE REACHING OUT

04:31:14.558 --> 04:31:16.259
TO THEIR OFFICES AT A LOWER

04:31:16.326 --> 04:31:17.461
RATE THAN USUAL, AND THIS IS A

04:31:17.527 --> 04:31:19.062
REALITY ACROSS VARIOUS PUBLIC

04:31:19.129 --> 04:31:19.630
SERVICES, BECAUSE VULNERABLE

04:31:19.696 --> 04:31:21.365
WORKING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UNDER

04:31:21.431 --> 04:31:22.299
ATTACK BY IMMIGRATION

04:31:22.366 --> 04:31:23.634
ENFORCEMENT, FURTHERING A

04:31:23.700 --> 04:31:24.201
CHILLING EFFECT THAT

04:31:24.267 --> 04:31:25.302
INTERTWINES WITH THE

04:31:25.369 --> 04:31:26.436
FRUSTRATIONS WORKING PEOPLE

04:31:26.503 --> 04:31:28.472
FACE, WHICH ARE MIRRORED IN THE

04:31:28.538 --> 04:31:30.307
AUDIT. AND THAT ON TOP, WE KNOW

04:31:30.374 --> 04:31:31.441
THAT THERE ARE FEDERAL CHANGES

04:31:31.508 --> 04:31:32.909
COMING TO FEDERAL OSHA AND

04:31:32.976 --> 04:31:34.244
OTHER PROTECTIONS. NOW, MORE

04:31:34.311 --> 04:31:36.413
THAN EVER, WORKING PEOPLE NEED

04:31:36.480 --> 04:31:37.314
A PROACTIVE AND FULLY CAPABLE

04:31:37.381 --> 04:31:39.316
CAL OSHA BECAUSE HAZARDS ARE

04:31:39.383 --> 04:31:40.651
STILL THERE AND WORKING PEOPLE

04:31:40.717 --> 04:31:42.452
ARE MORE FEARFUL TO REPORT THEM.

04:31:42.519 --> 04:31:44.321
THINKING OF STAFFING AS A

04:31:44.388 --> 04:31:45.956
SOLUTION, WE HAVE A UNIQUE

04:31:46.023 --> 04:31:46.490
OPPORTUNITY WITH AB1054 TO

04:31:46.556 --> 04:31:48.291

BUILD A DIVERSE, SKILLED

04:31:51.628 --> 04:31:52.462
WORKFORCE TO MEET OSHA STAFFING

04:31:52.529 --> 04:31:55.232
NEEDS. THERE IS NOTHING

04:31:55.298 --> 04:31:56.299
CURRENTLY LIKE AB 694, AND

04:31:56.366 --> 04:31:57.567
BUILDING A PIPELINE DIRECTLY

04:31:57.634 --> 04:31:59.036
ADDRESSES A RECOMMENDATION

04:31:59.102 --> 04:32:00.303
WITHIN THE AUDIT. WE URGE DIR

04:32:00.370 --> 04:32:02.305

04:32:02.372 --> 04:32:02.773
START ADDRESSING THESE

04:32:02.839 --> 04:32:04.374
CHALLENGES, AND WE THANK

04:32:04.441 --> 04:32:05.475

AND THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE

04:32:15.752 --> 04:32:17.454
FOR THEIR THEIR TIRELESS WORK.

04:32:17.521 --> 04:32:19.222
MY NAME IS BETH SPITLER AND I

04:32:19.289 --> 04:32:20.657
STAFF THE CALIFORNIA FARMWORKER

04:32:20.724 --> 04:32:22.059
COALITION, WHICH BUILDS POWER

04:32:22.125 --> 04:32:23.427
WITHIN GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS

04:32:23.493 --> 04:32:24.628
SO THAT FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES

04:32:24.695 --> 04:32:27.164
CAN INFLUENCE STATE POLICY. WE

04:32:27.230 --> 04:32:28.465
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

04:32:28.532 --> 04:32:30.901
PARTICIPATING IN THE FEBRUARY

04:32:30.967 --> 04:32:31.468
2024 ASSEMBLY INFORMATIONAL

04:32:31.535 --> 04:32:33.570
HEARING, CHAIRED BY ASSEMBLY

04:32:33.637 --> 04:32:35.372
MEMBER ORTEGA, AND IN

04:32:35.439 --> 04:32:37.207
PARTICULAR, WE HEARD FROM

04:32:37.274 --> 04:32:38.341
FARMWORKERS WHO SPOKE

04:32:38.408 --> 04:32:39.543
PASSIONATELY ABOUT THEIR

04:32:39.609 --> 04:32:41.178
FRUSTRATION DUE TO

04:32:41.244 --> 04:32:42.779
NON-RESPONSIVENESS DELAYS IN

04:32:42.846 --> 04:32:43.980
INVESTIGATION AND RESOLVING

04:32:44.047 --> 04:32:45.148
COMPLAINTS, AND THE USE OF

04:32:45.215 --> 04:32:47.651
LETTERS LETTER INVESTIGATIONS.

04:32:47.718 --> 04:32:50.487
WHILE WE HEARD ABOUT CAL-OSHA

04:32:50.554 --> 04:32:52.889
ABOUT KAILASH'S EFFORTS TO

04:32:52.956 --> 04:32:53.957
IMPROVE RECRUITMENT, THE THE

04:32:54.024 --> 04:32:56.593
DATA TELLS US THAT THIS IS

04:32:56.660 --> 04:32:59.196
STILL A MAJOR ISSUE. AND AS

04:32:59.262 --> 04:33:01.298
FARMWORKERS CONTINUE TO BE

04:33:01.364 --> 04:33:02.299
UNLAWFULLY TARGETED BY THE

04:33:02.365 --> 04:33:04.534
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION, IT IS

04:33:04.601 --> 04:33:05.335
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO

04:33:05.402 --> 04:33:07.270
HAVE A FULLY STAFFED AGENCY SO

04:33:07.337 --> 04:33:09.906
THAT THEY CAN RESPOND PROMPTLY

04:33:09.973 --> 04:33:10.507
TO COMPLAINTS AND PROACTIVELY

04:33:10.574 --> 04:33:12.576
CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS IN HIGH

04:33:12.642 --> 04:33:14.277
RISK SECTORS LIKE AGRICULTURE,

04:33:14.344 --> 04:33:15.512
WITHOUT REQUIRING VULNERABLE

04:33:15.579 --> 04:33:17.147
WORKERS TO COME FORWARD.

04:33:17.214 --> 04:33:18.715
LUCKILY, THE CALIFORNIA

04:33:18.782 --> 04:33:20.584
COALITION, FARMWORKER COALITION

04:33:20.650 --> 04:33:22.652
AND OTHER LABOR PARTNERS HAVE

04:33:22.719 --> 04:33:25.422
PUT FORWARD AB 694 AUTHORED BY

04:33:25.489 --> 04:33:27.324
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCKINNON, WHICH

04:33:27.390 --> 04:33:29.793
CAN CREATE A PATHWAY FOR

04:33:29.860 --> 04:33:30.494
INSPECTORS WITH INVALUABLE

04:33:30.560 --> 04:33:32.696
EXPERIENCE. YET NO COLLEGE

04:33:32.763 --> 04:33:33.930
DEGREES. SO WE HOPE THE

04:33:33.997 --> 04:33:35.365
ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE

04:33:35.432 --> 04:33:37.467
WILL COMMIT TO THIS LONG TERM

04:33:37.534 --> 04:33:40.604
SOLUTION TO A VERY LONG TERM

04:33:40.670 --> 04:33:42.739
CRISIS. AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR

04:33:42.806 --> 04:33:44.808

MORE. SO SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON,

MR. CHAIR. MEMBERS. I'LL BE

04:33:51.181 --> 04:33:52.349
BRIEF. I WAS REMISS AND I

04:33:52.415 --> 04:33:54.484
FORGOT TO MENTION WHEN 604 WAS

04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:56.052
RAISED. WE ARE NEUTRAL ON 694

04:33:56.119 --> 04:33:57.354
AND WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR'S

04:33:57.420 --> 04:33:58.522
OFFICE. AND I THINK IT'S, YOU

04:33:58.588 --> 04:34:00.524
KNOW, THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB

04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:02.192
WITH THAT BILL. SO I WANT TO

04:34:02.259 --> 04:34:03.560
PUT THAT ON THE RECORD. THANK

04:34:03.627 --> 04:34:04.694
YOU, THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT.

04:34:04.761 --> 04:34:05.395
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME

04:34:05.462 --> 04:34:07.664
TODAY. I WILL SAY THAT THIS WAS

04:34:07.731 --> 04:34:08.632
AN INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE

04:34:08.698 --> 04:34:09.499
DISCUSSION, AND I WANT TO THANK

04:34:09.566 --> 04:34:10.700
CHAIRWOMAN ORTEGA FOR BRINGING

04:34:10.767 --> 04:34:12.302
US HERE TODAY AND FOR THE

04:34:12.369 --> 04:34:14.237
AUDITOR FOR, YOU KNOW, HIS

04:34:14.304 --> 04:34:17.007
GREAT WORK, HIS WHOLE TEAM, MR.

04:34:17.073 --> 04:34:18.175
VERSACE. AND I ALSO WANT TO

04:34:18.241 --> 04:34:20.177
THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:34:20.243 --> 04:34:21.378
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS FOR BEING

04:34:21.444 --> 04:34:23.313
HERE, FOR PROVIDING THEIR

04:34:23.380 --> 04:34:25.215
PERSPECTIVE. THE LABOR, FED,

04:34:25.282 --> 04:34:28.185
CAL CHAMBER, WORKSAFE. I THINK

04:34:28.251 --> 04:34:30.420
IT'S CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A LOT

04:34:30.487 --> 04:34:32.522
OF WORK TO DO. WE MUST DO

04:34:32.589 --> 04:34:34.891
BETTER BASED ON THE OBJECTIVE

04:34:34.958 --> 04:34:35.659
METRICS AND EVERYTHING WE'VE

04:34:35.725 --> 04:34:37.294
HEARD. WE ARE FAILING. AND I

04:34:37.360 --> 04:34:39.296
THINK THAT CAL OSHA NOT ONLY

04:34:39.362 --> 04:34:41.298
HAS A STAFFING PROBLEM, I THINK

04:34:41.364 --> 04:34:42.299
THEY'VE HAD A LEADERSHIP

04:34:42.365 --> 04:34:44.467
PROBLEM WITH DIRECTOR OSBORNE

04:34:44.534 --> 04:34:47.270
COMING ON BOARD. I AM HOPEFUL

04:34:47.337 --> 04:34:49.339
THAT EVERY SINGLE

04:34:49.406 --> 04:34:50.273
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE SEE IN

04:34:50.340 --> 04:34:52.642
THIS AUDIT AND THERE'S 17 OF

04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:53.910
THEM, WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND

04:34:53.977 --> 04:34:55.078
THEY'LL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A

04:34:55.145 --> 04:34:57.380
TIMELY FASHION. AND WE HAVE

04:34:57.447 --> 04:34:58.448
HEARD FROM YOU TODAY AND WE'VE

04:34:58.515 --> 04:35:00.150
WE'VE SEEN YOUR WRITTEN

04:35:00.217 --> 04:35:01.618
SUBMISSIONS SAYING THAT YOU

04:35:01.685 --> 04:35:03.587
WILL DO THAT, AND WE WILL MAKE

04:35:03.653 --> 04:35:04.354
SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. AND WE

04:35:04.421 --> 04:35:06.323
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

04:35:06.389 --> 04:35:07.457
ACTUALLY SUCCEED IN THAT,

04:35:07.524 --> 04:35:08.725
BECAUSE YOUR SUCCESS IS OUR

04:35:08.792 --> 04:35:11.461
SUCCESS. AND I DO THINK THAT WE

04:35:11.528 --> 04:35:13.496
SHOULD ALL BE ROWING IN THE

04:35:13.563 --> 04:35:14.397
SAME BOAT. GOVERNMENT,

04:35:14.464 --> 04:35:17.133
REGULATORS, EMPLOYERS TO HELP

04:35:17.200 --> 04:35:19.269
PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES. WE ARE

04:35:19.336 --> 04:35:20.470
NOT DOING ENOUGH. WE HAVE NOT

04:35:20.537 --> 04:35:22.305
DONE ENOUGH ON THIS SIDE OF THE

04:35:22.372 --> 04:35:24.341
DAIS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO

04:35:24.407 --> 04:35:26.076
WORK HARDER. BUT I THINK THAT

04:35:26.142 --> 04:35:28.278
THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP, A

04:35:28.345 --> 04:35:30.380
LONG OVERDUE STEP. AND I THINK

04:35:30.447 --> 04:35:31.281
THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO

04:35:31.348 --> 04:35:34.284
HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION

04:35:34.351 --> 04:35:35.685
WITHIN ITS OWN RANKS ABOUT WHAT

04:35:35.752 --> 04:35:37.354
DOES SUCCESS LOOK LOOK LIKE FOR

04:35:37.420 --> 04:35:40.090
YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE IN

04:35:40.156 --> 04:35:42.225
A YEAR? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE

04:35:42.292 --> 04:35:43.827
IN FIVE YEARS? SO THAT WE ARE

04:35:43.894 --> 04:35:45.362
NOT CONTINUING TO HAVE THIS

04:35:45.428 --> 04:35:46.229
CONVERSATION? I THINK WE

04:35:46.296 --> 04:35:47.497
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OBJECTIVE

04:35:47.564 --> 04:35:48.565
MEASURES OF SUCCESS WOULD LOOK

04:35:48.632 --> 04:35:50.133
LIKE. WE WANT TO SEE LESS

04:35:50.200 --> 04:35:51.301
COMPLAINTS. WE WANT TO SEE

04:35:51.368 --> 04:35:52.402
BETTER SAFETY MEASURES. WE WANT

04:35:52.469 --> 04:35:54.137
TO SEE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND

04:35:54.204 --> 04:35:55.272
THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS TO DO

04:35:55.338 --> 04:35:57.274
THAT, STARTING WITH THESE 17

04:35:57.340 --> 04:35:58.575
RECOMMENDATIONS. SO WE LOOK

04:35:58.642 --> 04:35:59.409
FORWARD TO CONTINUING

04:35:59.476 --> 04:36:00.844
CONVERSATIONS, CONTINUING

04:36:00.911 --> 04:36:04.247
EFFORTS LED BY YOU. BUT WITH

04:36:04.314 --> 04:36:06.383
OUR HELP ON MAKING SURE THAT WE

04:36:06.449 --> 04:36:07.617
RIGHT THESE WRONGS AND WE HAVE

04:36:07.684 --> 04:36:09.386
A PASSING GRADE VERY, VERY

04:36:09.452 --> 04:36:11.354
QUICKLY. SO WITH THAT, THANK

04:36:11.421 --> 04:36:13.590
YOU TO EVERYONE. AND THIS

04:36:13.657 --> 04:36:30.607
MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
