SUBSEQUENTLY OUR OWN NATION AND

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:12.766

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:15.302
TREATIES, BREAK THEIR WORD,

01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:17.805
STEAL LAND, AND RENDER THOSE WHO

MANY GENERATIONS AS SECOND CLASS

ENSLAVEMENT OF NATIVE

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:38.325
CALIFORNIANS AND CONTRIBUTED TO

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:41.361
THEIR GENOCIDE. HE DECLARED THAT

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:43.063
A WAR OF EXTERMINATION WILL

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:44.431
CONTINUE TO BE WAGED BETWEEN THE

01:41:44.498 --> 01:41:46.266
RACES UNTIL THE INDIAN RACE

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:48.769

PETER BURNETT. THOSE IN POWER

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:14.695
THAT WOULD IGNORANTLY LABEL THE

DIGNIFIED NATIVE TRIBES AS

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.264

HAPPENED IN THIS LEGISLATURE IN

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:01.635
JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS OF

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:02.535
FINALLY HAVING REPRESENTATION ON

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:08.341
TELLING THE TRUTH, TELLING THE

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:09.409
WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT GOVERNOR

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:11.778
BURNETT AND OTHERS. CALIFORNIA

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:13.480
IS A STATE OF BROKEN PROMISES

01:49:13.546 --> 01:49:15.181
AND BROKEN TREATIES, A STATE

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:16.650
WHERE WE STOLE NATIVE CHILDREN

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:18.551
AND FORCED ASSIMILATION. WE

01:49:18.618 --> 01:49:19.853
STOLE NATIVE DIETS AND WE FORCED

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.022
FED GOVERNMENT CHEESE. WE

01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:23.924
COMMITTED GENOCIDE UNLIKE ANY

01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:25.692
OTHER STATE BECAUSE THERE WAS

01:49:25.759 --> 01:49:28.128
NOWHERE ELSE TO PUSH. FOLKS, OUR

01:49:28.194 --> 01:49:31.431
MANIFEST DESTINY IS A VIOLENT,

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:32.933
VIOLENT STORY, AND WE HAVE TO

01:49:32.999 --> 01:49:35.201
GRAPPLE WITH THAT TRUTH. IT ALSO

01:49:35.268 --> 01:49:36.836
IMPACTS THE WORK THAT WE DO.

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:38.905
TODAY. I WAS TOURING THE BARONA

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:39.873
TRIBE NOT THAT LONG AGO. YOU

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.608
KNOW, THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:43.376
ELECTRICITY UNTIL THE 50S. WE

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:44.711
HAVE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES THAT DO

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:46.913
NOT HAVE THE BASIC

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:48.748
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SO MANY OF

01:49:48.815 --> 01:49:50.884
US TAKE FOR GRANTED IN OUR

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:51.551
MUNICIPALITIES, BECAUSE THAT IS

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:54.254
WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS LEFT THEM

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:55.588
WITH. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO

01:49:55.655 --> 01:49:58.725
CREATE SPACE AT EVERY TABLE, AT

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:00.527
EVERY POLICY SEAT FOR

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:01.861
CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE,

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.763
BECAUSE IT IS THEIR LAND. IT IS

01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:05.732
THAT LAND THAT OUR STATE WAS

01:50:05.799 --> 01:50:07.701
FOUNDED ON AND BUILT ON. BUT

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:10.637
THAT FOUNDATION IS VIOLENT, AND

01:50:10.704 --> 01:50:13.273
THE FUTURE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:14.474
BUT WE CAN'T BUILD THAT FUTURE

01:50:14.541 --> 01:50:15.709
UNLESS WE RECONCILE WITH THAT

01:50:15.775 --> 01:50:17.610
PAST. SO I WANT TO THANK OUR

02:36:41.425 --> 02:36:43.193
CONFRONTING THESE CHALLENGES AND

02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:45.062
TRYING TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED

02:36:45.129 --> 02:36:46.163
SERVICES FOR SOME OF OUR MOST

02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:48.165
VULNERABLE PEOPLE. THEY ARE

02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:51.401
FOLKS WHO ANSWER THE CALL AT ALL

02:36:51.468 --> 02:36:53.237
TIMES OF DAY, WHO WALK CITY

02:36:53.303 --> 02:36:56.707
STREETS WITH SUPPLIES AND WITH

02:36:56.774 --> 02:36:57.708
COMPASSION, WHO HELP OUR

02:36:59.777 --> 02:37:02.212
GUIDE OUR YOUNGER PEOPLE INTO

02:37:02.279 --> 02:37:04.715
SAFE HOMES. AND THEY ARE CASE

02:37:04.782 --> 02:37:06.316
MANAGERS. THEY ARE OUTREACH

02:37:06.383 --> 02:37:07.317
WORKERS. THEY ARE NURSES. THEY

02:37:07.384 --> 02:37:09.153
ARE NAVIGATORS. THEY ARE COOKS

02:37:09.219 --> 02:37:11.655
AND ADVOCATES. THEY COULD CHOOSE

02:37:11.722 --> 02:37:14.591
ANY CAREER AND LIKELY EARN A LOT

02:37:14.658 --> 02:37:16.393
MORE MONEY DOING THAT. BUT THEY

02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:18.462
CHOOSE TO WORK IN THIS FIELD DAY

02:37:18.529 --> 02:37:20.564
IN AND DAY OUT BECAUSE THEY

02:37:20.631 --> 02:37:22.766
BELIEVE THAT HOUSING IS A HUMAN

02:37:22.833 --> 02:37:24.835
RIGHT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

02:37:24.902 --> 02:37:26.436
I'VE BEEN TO SOME OF THE

02:37:26.503 --> 02:37:27.938
ENCAMPMENTS, I'VE SPENT TIME

02:37:28.005 --> 02:37:29.173
WITH A LOT OF OUR FRONTLINE

02:37:29.239 --> 02:37:31.441
WORKERS WHO ARE SERVING THESE

02:37:31.508 --> 02:37:32.910
COMMUNITIES, AND I WOULD

02:37:32.976 --> 02:37:34.011
RECOMMEND EVERYONE DO THAT IN

02:37:34.077 --> 02:37:35.679
YOUR COMMUNITY AND GO SPEND TIME

02:37:35.746 --> 02:37:38.248
WITH THEM IN THE WORK THAT THEY

02:37:38.315 --> 02:37:39.716
DO. AND WHAT I REALIZED WHEN I

02:37:39.783 --> 02:37:41.618
SPENT TIME WITH THEM IS SO MUCH

02:37:41.685 --> 02:37:43.787
OF THEIR WORK IS BUILT ON THE

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:45.455
RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY DEVELOP

02:37:45.522 --> 02:37:47.991
WITH THEIR CLIENTELE. THE TRUST

02:37:48.058 --> 02:37:50.060
THAT IS CREATED WITH THAT

02:37:50.127 --> 02:37:51.929
RELATIONSHIP. A LOT OF THE FOLKS

02:37:51.995 --> 02:37:52.529
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE

02:37:52.596 --> 02:37:54.865
VERY DISTRUSTFUL OF OUR SYSTEMS,

02:37:54.932 --> 02:37:57.668
AND THEY'RE DISTRUSTFUL FOR MANY

02:37:57.734 --> 02:37:59.469
JUSTIFIABLE REASONS. AND THEY

02:37:59.536 --> 02:38:01.038
SPEND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME

02:38:01.104 --> 02:38:02.406
BUILDING THAT TRUST, BUILDING

02:38:02.472 --> 02:38:04.441
THAT RELATIONSHIP, SO THAT WHEN

02:38:04.508 --> 02:38:05.976
FOLKS ARE READY TO SEEK

02:38:06.043 --> 02:38:07.711
SERVICES, THERE'S A TRUSTING

02:38:07.778 --> 02:38:08.645
RELATIONSHIP THERE TO PROVIDE

02:38:08.712 --> 02:38:10.948
THOSE SERVICES. SO WE KNOW THIS

02:38:11.014 --> 02:38:12.516
CRISIS IS DAUNTING. WE KNOW IT'S

02:38:12.583 --> 02:38:15.319
GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US TO SOLVE

02:38:15.385 --> 02:38:16.253
THE PROBLEM, BUT IT'S REALLY

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:17.921
THESE WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES

02:38:17.988 --> 02:38:19.389
WHO ARE DOING GOD'S WORK EVERY

02:38:19.456 --> 02:38:21.491
SINGLE DAY TO SERVE OUR

02:38:21.558 --> 02:38:22.659
COMMUNITIES. AND SO WITH THIS

02:38:22.726 --> 02:38:24.161
MONTH AND EVERY MONTH, I WANT TO

02:38:24.228 --> 02:38:27.030

19TH AMENDMENT, A MILESTONE THAT

02:54:29.959 --> 02:54:32.028
FOREVER CHANGED THE FACE OF OUR

02:54:32.094 --> 02:54:34.831
DEMOCRACY. IN 1920, WOMEN IN

02:54:34.897 --> 02:54:36.365
AMERICA WON THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

02:54:36.432 --> 02:54:37.800
AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA, WE WERE

02:54:37.867 --> 02:54:40.369
AHEAD OF THE CURVE GRANTING

02:54:40.436 --> 02:54:42.805
WOMEN SUFFRAGE IN 1911. BUT WE

02:54:42.872 --> 02:54:45.308
ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH THAT

02:54:45.374 --> 02:54:47.410
FOR DECADES AFTER, MANY WOMEN,

02:54:47.476 --> 02:54:48.911
ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR AND

02:54:48.978 --> 02:54:50.346
WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES, WERE

02:54:50.413 --> 02:54:53.182
STILL DENIED FULL PARTICIPATION.

02:54:53.249 --> 02:54:55.852
TODAY, WE HONORED CALIFORNIA

02:54:55.918 --> 02:54:58.020
NATIVE AMERICAN DAY AND WE, I

02:54:58.087 --> 02:54:59.355
THINK, MUST ALSO HIGHLIGHT

02:54:59.422 --> 02:55:01.224
NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN AT THE

02:55:01.290 --> 02:55:03.059
TIME OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE WERE

02:55:03.125 --> 02:55:05.862
NOT CONSIDERED CITIZENS IN 1920

02:55:05.928 --> 02:55:08.064
AND SO STILL DID NOT HAVE THE

02:55:08.130 --> 02:55:09.498
RIGHT TO VOTE. POLL TAXES ON

02:55:09.565 --> 02:55:10.900
NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN AND

02:55:10.967 --> 02:55:13.469
AFRICAN AMERICANS CONTINUE TO

02:55:13.536 --> 02:55:15.738
CREATE BARRIERS TO HAVE THE TRUE

02:55:15.805 --> 02:55:19.642
RIGHT TO VOTE, AND TODAY, AS YOU

02:55:19.709 --> 02:55:23.145
KNOW, NEW CALLS ARE BEING LIFTED

02:55:23.212 --> 02:55:25.181
UP ON PLATFORMS. SHOCKINGLY,

02:55:25.248 --> 02:55:27.617
GIVEN A PLATFORM TO QUESTION

02:55:27.683 --> 02:55:29.585
WHETHER WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THE

02:55:29.652 --> 02:55:31.854
RIGHT TO VOTE ANYMORE, THIS IS

02:55:31.921 --> 02:55:33.923
SUCH AN IMPORTANT TIME FOR US TO

02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:35.024
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IMPORTANT PIECE

02:55:35.091 --> 02:55:37.326
OF OUR HISTORY. THIS RESOLUTION

02:55:37.393 --> 02:55:38.895
IS MORE THAN A HISTORY LESSON.

02:55:38.961 --> 02:55:41.030
IT REMINDS US THAT PROGRESS

02:55:41.097 --> 02:55:43.199
COMES THROUGH COURAGE,

02:55:43.266 --> 02:55:45.368
PERSISTENCE, AND THE REFUSAL TO

02:55:45.434 --> 02:55:48.971
ACCEPT EXCLUSION. TODAY, WOMEN

02:55:49.038 --> 02:55:51.540
VOTERS HAVE SHAPED OUR LAWS,

02:55:51.607 --> 02:55:52.875
STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES, AND

02:55:52.942 --> 02:55:55.111
OPENED UP DOORS FOR GENERATIONS

02:55:55.177 --> 02:55:57.647
TO COME IN CLASSROOMS AND

02:55:57.713 --> 02:55:59.448
BOARDROOMS. AND ON THIS VERY

02:55:59.515 --> 02:56:01.584
FLOOR, AS WE CELEBRATE THIS

02:56:01.651 --> 02:56:03.052
ANNIVERSARY, LET US COMMIT TO

02:56:03.119 --> 02:56:04.520
PROTECTING THE RIGHTS SO MANY

02:56:04.587 --> 02:56:06.455
HAVE FOUGHT FOR AND ENSURING

02:56:06.522 --> 02:56:08.758
THAT EVERY VOICE, EVERY WOMAN'S

02:56:08.824 --> 02:56:11.727
VOICE, IS HEARD AND VALUED.

02:56:11.794 --> 02:56:12.962
COLLEAGUES, I RESPECTFULLY

02:56:13.029 --> 02:56:16.299
REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON H.R. 48.

02:56:16.365 --> 02:56:18.301
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, ASSEMBLY

02:56:18.367 --> 02:56:19.936
MEMBER. PELLERIN, YOU ARE

02:56:20.002 --> 02:56:21.737
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:56:21.804 --> 02:56:23.272
SPEAKER, AND MEMBERS, AND THANK

02:56:23.339 --> 02:56:25.007
YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA

02:56:25.074 --> 02:56:27.243
CLARITA VALLEY FOR PRESENTING

02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:30.046
H.R. 48 ON MY BEHALF. TODAY, WE

02:56:30.112 --> 02:56:32.114
MARK THE 105TH ANNIVERSARY OF

02:56:32.181 --> 02:56:34.684
THE 19TH AMENDMENT, A MILESTONE

02:56:34.750 --> 02:56:36.619
THAT FOREVER CHANGED THE COURSE

02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:39.755
OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IN 1920, AFTER

02:56:39.822 --> 02:56:41.857
A DECADES OF STRUGGLE, WOMEN

02:56:41.924 --> 02:56:43.693
SECURED THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT

02:56:43.759 --> 02:56:45.828
TO VOTE. IT WAS NOT THE END OF

02:56:45.895 --> 02:56:49.031
THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY, BUT IT

02:56:49.098 --> 02:56:50.499
WAS A GIANT STEP FORWARD. AS

02:56:50.566 --> 02:56:52.401
SOMEONE WHO SPENT MORE THAN 27

02:56:52.468 --> 02:56:53.402
YEARS SERVING AS THE CHIEF

02:56:53.469 --> 02:56:55.137
ELECTIONS OFFICIAL IN SANTA CRUZ

02:56:55.204 --> 02:56:56.973
COUNTY, I'VE WITNESSED FIRSTHAND

02:56:57.039 --> 02:56:59.475
THE POWER AND PROMISE OF THAT

02:56:59.542 --> 02:57:01.344
RIGHT. I'VE SEEN YOUNG WOMEN

02:57:01.410 --> 02:57:03.479
CASTING THEIR BALLOT, OLDER

02:57:03.546 --> 02:57:05.648
WOMEN VOTING FOR THE FIRST TIME,

02:57:05.715 --> 02:57:07.483
AND GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES

02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:09.251
SHOWING UP TOGETHER TO

02:57:09.318 --> 02:57:10.786
PARTICIPATE IN SHAPING THEIR

02:57:10.853 --> 02:57:13.222
FUTURE. EACH BALLOT, WHETHER

02:57:13.289 --> 02:57:15.758
CAST IN PERSON, BY MAIL, OR

02:57:15.825 --> 02:57:17.893
DROPPED INTO A SECURE BOX,

02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:19.729
CARRIES THE WEIGHT OF THOSE WHO

02:57:19.795 --> 02:57:21.497
FOUGHT FOR A VOICE IN OUR

02:57:21.564 --> 02:57:24.033
DEMOCRACY. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THE

02:57:24.100 --> 02:57:25.568
19TH AMENDMENT DID NOT EXTEND

02:57:25.634 --> 02:57:28.004
THE FRANCHISE TO ALL WOMEN. FOR

02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:30.139
WOMEN OF COLOR, NATIVE AMERICAN

02:57:30.206 --> 02:57:32.308
WOMEN, IMMIGRANTS, AND OTHERS,

02:57:32.375 --> 02:57:34.810
BARRIERS PERSISTED FOR DECADES,

02:57:34.877 --> 02:57:37.279
AND IN MANY WAYS, THEY REMAIN

02:57:37.346 --> 02:57:41.250
TODAY. THAT REALITY DEEPENS OUR

02:57:41.317 --> 02:57:42.318
RESPONSIBILITY, BECAUSE

02:57:42.385 --> 02:57:43.819
PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS

02:57:43.886 --> 02:57:46.689
NOT JUST ABOUT HONORING HISTORY,

02:57:46.756 --> 02:57:49.258
IT'S ABOUT ENSURING EQUITY AND

02:57:49.325 --> 02:57:51.293
ACCESS FOR EVERY ELIGIBLE VOTER,

02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:54.597
IN EVERY COMMUNITY, IN EVERY

02:57:54.663 --> 02:57:57.666
ELECTION. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE

02:57:57.733 --> 02:57:58.567
SUFFRAGISTS WHO MARCHED,

02:57:58.634 --> 02:58:00.669
ORGANIZE, AND PERSEVERED AGAINST

02:58:00.736 --> 02:58:02.972
OVERWHELMING ODDS, I THINK ABOUT

02:58:03.039 --> 02:58:04.440
THE POLL WORKERS, ELECTION STAFF

02:58:04.507 --> 02:58:07.209
AND VOLUNTEERS I HAD THE HONOR

02:58:07.276 --> 02:58:08.911
OF WORKING ALONGSIDE ALL THOSE

02:58:08.978 --> 02:58:11.113
YEARS. THEIR DEDICATION IS CUT

02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:14.016
FROM THE SAME CLOTH, ORDINARY

02:58:14.083 --> 02:58:16.919
PEOPLE DOING EXTRAORDINARY WORK

02:58:16.986 --> 02:58:21.991
IN DEEP TO KEEP DEMOCRACY ALIVE.

02:58:22.058 --> 02:58:23.759
MEMBERS. AS WE REMEMBER, THE

02:58:23.826 --> 02:58:25.995
SUFFRAGISTS CHANTING VOTES FOR

02:58:26.062 --> 02:58:29.165
WOMEN, NO VOTE, NO TAX. AND MR.

02:58:29.231 --> 02:58:31.333
PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN

02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:33.869
WAIT FOR LIBERTY? WE HEAR ECHOES

02:58:33.936 --> 02:58:36.405
THAT STILL RING TRUE TODAY.

02:58:36.472 --> 02:58:38.474
THEIR FIGHT WAS NOT ONLY FOR THE

02:58:38.541 --> 02:58:40.976
BALLOT, IT WAS FOR DIGNITY,

02:58:41.043 --> 02:58:42.812
EQUALITY AND A VOICE IN SHAPING

02:58:42.878 --> 02:58:45.781
THE FUTURE. MORE THAN A CENTURY

02:58:45.848 --> 02:58:47.216
LATER, WE CONTINUE TO FACE

02:58:47.283 --> 02:58:49.752
EFFORTS TO SILENCE VOTERS,

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:52.922
RESTRICT WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND DENY

02:58:52.988 --> 02:58:54.790
OPPORTUNITY. THE SUFFRAGISTS

02:58:54.857 --> 02:58:56.559
REMIND US THAT DEMOCRACY IS

02:58:56.625 --> 02:58:58.627
NEVER FINISHED. IT MUST BE

02:58:58.694 --> 02:59:01.564
DEFENDED AND EXPANDED IN EVERY

02:59:01.630 --> 02:59:03.666
GENERATION. THEIR CRIES FOR

02:59:03.732 --> 02:59:06.902
JUSTICE ARE OUR CALL TO ACTION

02:59:06.969 --> 02:59:08.704
TO PROTECT THE FREEDOM TO VOTE,

02:59:08.771 --> 02:59:10.639
TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS, AND TO

02:59:10.706 --> 02:59:12.575
CARRY FORWARD THEIR VISION OF A

02:59:12.641 --> 02:59:15.978
MORE INCLUSIVE, MORE EQUAL

02:59:16.045 --> 02:59:18.547
AMERICA. SO TODAY, AS WE

02:59:18.614 --> 02:59:20.649
CELEBRATE 105 YEARS OF WOMEN'S

02:59:20.716 --> 02:59:22.451
SUFFRAGE, LET'S RECOMMIT

02:59:22.518 --> 02:59:24.253
OURSELVES TO PROTECTING THAT

02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:27.089
HARD WON RIGHT. LET'S ENSURE OUR

02:59:27.156 --> 02:59:28.624
DAUGHTERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS

02:59:28.691 --> 02:59:30.693
INHERIT A DEMOCRACY THAT IS

02:59:30.759 --> 02:59:32.428
STRONGER, MORE INCLUSIVE, AND

02:59:32.495 --> 02:59:34.597
MORE RESILIENT THAN THE ONE WE

02:59:34.663 --> 02:59:37.266
FOUND. THAT, I BELIEVE, IS THE

02:59:37.333 --> 02:59:39.535
TRUEST WAY TO HONOR THE LEGACY

02:59:39.602 --> 02:59:42.037
OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. I

02:59:42.104 --> 02:59:43.873
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

02:59:43.939 --> 02:59:46.942
VOTE ON H.R. 48. THANK YOU.

02:59:47.009 --> 02:59:49.278
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PELLERIN.

02:59:49.345 --> 02:59:50.146
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMAIO, YOU ARE

02:59:50.212 --> 02:59:52.982
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:59:53.048 --> 02:59:59.121
SPEAKER. MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONS

02:59:59.188 --> 03:00:02.892
ECHOES STILL HEARD TODAY. HOW

03:00:02.958 --> 03:00:06.695
TRUE ARE THOSE WORDS? WE HAVE A

03:00:06.762 --> 03:00:08.964
RESOLUTION. ANOTHER ONE OF THESE

03:00:09.031 --> 03:00:09.999
HONORARY RESOLUTIONS WHERE WE

03:00:10.065 --> 03:00:13.936
ALL SPEAK IN A LOFTY MANNER

03:00:14.003 --> 03:00:17.506
ABOUT PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY.

03:00:17.573 --> 03:00:20.042
IN THIS CASE, IT'S ENSURING THAT

03:00:20.109 --> 03:00:28.017
WOMEN HAVE EQUITY AND ACCESS.

03:00:28.083 --> 03:00:30.486
THIS IS A SYMBOLIC RESOLUTION.

03:00:30.553 --> 03:00:32.354
IT WILL GET ALL OF OUR SUPPORT,

03:00:32.421 --> 03:00:36.892
AS IT SHOULD. BUT WORDS PALE

03:00:36.959 --> 03:00:42.731
INTO COMPARISON TO ACTIONS. AND

03:00:42.798 --> 03:00:46.669
AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR VOTES THIS

03:00:46.735 --> 03:00:52.408
WEEK ON ACTUAL ACTIONS THAT WILL

03:00:52.474 --> 03:00:57.479
EVISCERATE EQUITY AND ACCESS AND

03:00:57.546 --> 03:01:00.482
FAIRNESS FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN,

03:01:00.549 --> 03:01:02.952
THAT WILL UNDERMINE THE VOICES

03:01:03.018 --> 03:01:05.788
OF WOMEN OF FEMALE CANDIDATES,

03:01:05.854 --> 03:01:09.725
TO HAVE FAIR DISTRICTS DRAWN BY

03:01:09.792 --> 03:01:12.595
CITIZENS ON NONPARTIZAN LINES.

03:01:12.661 --> 03:01:14.663
LET'S REMEMBER THAT OUR

03:01:14.730 --> 03:01:17.333
DEMOCRACY IS UNDERMINED BY THOSE

03:01:17.399 --> 03:01:20.869
ACTIONS AS WE SPEAK. LOFTY

03:01:20.936 --> 03:01:23.372
PLATITUDES IN OUR IN OUR

03:01:23.439 --> 03:01:26.709
SYMBOLIC RESOLUTIONS MATCH YOUR

03:01:26.775 --> 03:01:29.945
WORDS TO YOUR ACTIONS. WITH

03:01:30.012 --> 03:01:31.914
THAT, I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION

03:01:31.981 --> 03:01:34.283
AND HOPE THAT IT CARRIES OVER TO

03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:35.751
THE REMAINDER OF OUR BUSINESS

03:01:35.818 --> 03:01:39.255
THIS WEEK. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

03:01:42.458 --> 03:01:43.892
HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE.

03:01:43.959 --> 03:01:44.927
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHIAVO DO YOU

03:01:44.994 --> 03:01:47.363
WISH TO CLOSE? I WANT TO THANK

03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:52.234
MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS

03:01:52.301 --> 03:01:54.803
TODAY. I YOU KNOW, I JUST DID A

03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:57.539
QUICK LITTLE SEARCH AND AS I

03:01:57.606 --> 03:02:00.476
MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS, I

03:02:00.542 --> 03:02:02.444
TALKED ABOUT HOW IT'S SHOCKING

03:02:02.511 --> 03:02:04.046
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL LIKE

03:02:04.113 --> 03:02:06.248
WE'VE SETTLED THE WOMEN'S RIGHT

03:02:06.315 --> 03:02:09.551
TO VOTE IS NOW BEING QUESTIONED.

03:02:09.618 --> 03:02:13.389
AND NOT ONLY THAT ARE US DEFENSE

03:02:13.455 --> 03:02:16.325
SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH RETWEETED

03:02:16.392 --> 03:02:18.827
A VIDEO TALKING ABOUT HOW WOMEN

03:02:18.894 --> 03:02:20.329
SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO

03:02:20.396 --> 03:02:23.666
VOTE IN THIS LAST MONTH. THIS

03:02:23.732 --> 03:02:26.101
WAS NOT YEARS AGO. THIS IS NOT

03:02:26.168 --> 03:02:28.237
OLD NEWS. THIS IS NEW NEWS RIGHT

03:02:28.304 --> 03:02:30.806
NOW. SOMEONE WHO IS LEADING OUR

03:02:30.873 --> 03:02:32.174
COUNTRY IS SAYING THAT WOMEN

03:02:32.241 --> 03:02:33.676
SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO

03:02:33.742 --> 03:02:35.377
VOTE. SO THIS IS A SERIOUS

03:02:35.444 --> 03:02:36.979
ISSUE. THIS IS A CURRENT ISSUE.

03:02:37.046 --> 03:02:38.614
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

03:02:38.681 --> 03:02:42.251
ARE NOT LIFTING UP SYMBOLICALLY.

03:02:42.318 --> 03:02:45.154
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE

03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:46.522
IT IS UNDER THREAT IN A REAL

03:02:46.588 --> 03:02:49.358
WAY, AND WE SHOULD HAVE UNITY

03:02:49.425 --> 03:02:52.328
WITHIN THIS BODY, WITHIN ALL OF

03:02:52.394 --> 03:02:54.430
AMERICA, THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE

03:02:54.496 --> 03:02:57.066
THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AND WITH
