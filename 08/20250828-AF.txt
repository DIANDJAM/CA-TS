01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:25.360
BILLION. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR,

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.262
THIS WAS ESTABLISHED IN

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:29.831
CONGRESS, AND THESE FOLKS ARE

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.466
HERE LEGALLY AND HAVE FOLLOWED

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:33.101
THE RULES. AND TEMPORARY

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:34.269
PROTECTED STATUS HAS BEEN

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.037
EXTENDED WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:38.840
SUPPORT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:41.343
UNFORTUNATELY, THE CURRENT

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.544
ADMINISTRATION HAS ATTEMPTED TO

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.980
ELIMINATE TEMPORARY PROTECTED

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:47.415
STATUS FOR MANY OF THESE

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:49.017
NATIONALITIES. THIS WOULD CAUSE

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:52.154
CHAOS. IT WOULD CAUSE FAMILY

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.090
SEPARATION. OVER 275,000

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:56.658
AMERICAN CHILDREN NATIONWIDE

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:58.460
HAVE A PARENT WITH TEMPORARY

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.962
PROTECTED STATUS. WE KNOW HERE

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:03.031
IN CALIFORNIA THAT THESE

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:04.766
RESIDENTS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:07.202
ECONOMY. THEY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:09.571
COMMUNITIES AND ABRUPTLY

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.072
TERMINATING FOR TENS OF

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:13.608
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS.

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:16.011
TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:17.779
WOULD BE A BETRAYAL OF OUR

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:18.980
VALUES AND DEEPLY DEVASTATING

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:21.216
FOR OUR STATE. THIS RESOLUTION

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:22.784
WILL SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.519
CALIFORNIA STANDS WITH THESE

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.588
FAMILIES, AND CALLS ON CONGRESS

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.056
TO FINALLY PASS LEGISLATION

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:29.624
THAT PROVIDES LONG TERM

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:31.259
STABILITY, A PATH TO RESIDENCY,

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:33.995
AND ULTIMATELY, CITIZENSHIP. I

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:36.865
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:38.266
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:40.101
HAYNIE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TAMAYO,

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:42.003
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.138
MR. SPEAKER. I RISE IN

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:45.574
OPPOSITION TO H.R. EIGHT. NOT

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:49.077
BECAUSE CALIFORNIANS OPPOSE

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:52.013
WELCOMING AND GIVING REFUGE TO

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.816
PEOPLE FLEEING PERSECUTION. WE

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:57.085
HAVE A LONG HERITAGE OF DOING

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.720
THAT. WE ALSO HAVE SOME DARK

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:01.323
PERIODS IN OUR HISTORY OF NOT

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:02.290
DOING IT WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:04.893
AND NEEDED, INCLUDING DURING

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.429
WORLD WAR TWO WHEN JEWS WERE

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.331
PERSECUTED BUT NOT WARMLY

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.566
RECEIVED AND AND PROTECTED BY

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:14.336
OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:16.204
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE SPEAK

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:17.439
ABOUT THESE ISSUES, WE SPEAK

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:20.408
WITH CLARITY, WITH FACT, AND

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.643
NOT TRY TO POLITICIZE THIS

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.247
IMPORTANT ISSUE. IF WE TRULY

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.015
WANT TO BE A WELCOMING COUNTRY,

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:29.150
WE CANNOT ALLOW THE ASYLUM

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:32.287
SYSTEM TO BE ABUSED, AS IT HAS

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:33.521
BEEN REPEATEDLY BY PEOPLE WHO

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:36.524
ARE NOT TRUE POLITICALLY

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:38.026
PERSECUTED INDIVIDUALS, BUT

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:38.893
RATHER PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.962
COME TO THIS COUNTRY BUT ARE

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:42.230
LOOKING FOR A WAY TO VIOLATE

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:45.967
THE RULES. LET ME BE CLEAR

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:48.136
AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE OF OUR

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.971
IMMIGRANTS. TEN GENERATIONS OF

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:52.807
THE BEST, THE BRIGHTEST, THE

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:55.310
COURAGEOUS PEOPLE SEEKING A

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:56.478
BETTER LIFE CAME TO THIS

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:59.214
COUNTRY, TOOK GREAT RISKS TO

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:01.049
GET HERE. THEY WEREN'T ASKING

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:03.051
FOR ANYTHING BUT AN OPPORTUNITY,

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:04.919
AND THEY WERE NOT BREAKING THE

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:06.921
LAW. THEY WANTED TO PLAY BY THE

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:08.957
RULES, WORK HARD AND ACHIEVE

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:10.759
THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND AS A

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:14.262
RESULT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS,

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:16.965
THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY. SO WE

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:19.334
ARE NOT AGAINST IMMIGRATION. WE

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:22.003
ARE NOT AGAINST ASYLUM. WHAT

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:24.739
WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING IS THAT WE

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:25.340
NOT HAVE LAWBREAKERS. WE NOT

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:28.877
HAVE ABUSE IN THE ISSUES THAT

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:31.980
THE AUTHOR RAISES. THIS

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.114
ADMINISTRATION IS SIMPLY

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:36.718
IDENTIFYING SITUATIONS WHERE

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:41.022
THERE ARE NO LONGER IS A BASIS

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:46.094
FOR THE ASYLUM, NO LONGER IS A

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:48.063
FACTUAL BASIS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:51.833
TO FLEE THEIR ORIGINAL COUNTRY.

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:54.069
WE HAVE TO HAVE A PROCESS

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:55.904
WHEREBY WE DECLARE A CERTAIN

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:58.273
AREA NO LONGER NEEDING

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:01.176
PROTECTION. WITH ASYLUM. IT

01:23:01.242 --> 01:23:02.977
WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST THROUGH

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:05.146
THIS RESOLUTION THAT THE AUTHOR

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:07.082
BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:09.250
ANY LIMITATION ON ASYLUM, AND

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:11.019
AGAIN, THAT WEAKENS THIS TOOL.

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:13.388
WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WE NO

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:14.422
LONGER HAVE AN ASYLUM PROCESS.

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:16.358
WE SIMPLY HAVE AN OPEN DOOR.

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:17.292
AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:17.859
CALIFORNIANS AGREE, AND IT'S

01:23:17.926 --> 01:23:19.828
NOT SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIANS

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:22.063
SEE AS FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:25.033
CALIFORNIANS ARE FAIR. WHAT YOU

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.068
ARE BACKING IN THIS RESOLUTION

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:30.138
IS A PROCESS THAT IS INHERENTLY

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.940
UNFAIR, AND IT DOES NOT PROVIDE

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:34.976
FOR A PROTECTION OF THOSE

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.811
FLEEING PERSECUTION. SO

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:38.012
UNFORTUNATELY, I WILL BE

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:39.247
CASTING A NO VOTE. I'M SURE

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.281
THAT THAT WILL BE

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:40.982
MISREPRESENTED BY THE OTHER

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:43.218
SIDE. AND THAT'S TRULY

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:45.053
UNFORTUNATE, BECAUSE THIS IS AN

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.287
ISSUE THAT ALL OF US SHOULD BE

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:47.255
COMING TOGETHER AND SPEAKING

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:49.524
WITH GREAT CLARITY AND GREAT

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:52.060
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. I URGE MY

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:53.361
COLLEAGUES TO EITHER WITHDRAW

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:55.497
THE RESOLUTION TO AMEND IT TO

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:56.965
CLARIFY THESE DEFICIENCIES, OR

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:59.834
I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO,

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.202
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:03.872
DEMAIO. SEEING AND HEARING NO

01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:06.007
FURTHER DEBATE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.642
HANEY, DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE?

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:08.977
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I DO

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:11.246
WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS,

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:13.882
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SOME

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:15.283
MISREPRESENTATION FROM MY

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:16.785
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. THIS

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.119
ISN'T ABOUT ANYBODY WHO HAS

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:20.355
BROKEN THE LAW. THIS ISN'T

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:21.856
ABOUT SELECTIVELY LOOKING AT

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:24.359
WHO QUALIFIES AND WHO DOES NOT.

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:25.460
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.562
PROPOSED TO COMPLETELY

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:30.064
ELIMINATE TEMPORARY PROTECTED

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:30.999
STATUS FOR HUNDREDS OF

01:24:31.065 --> 01:24:32.967
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:35.103
BOARD, REGARDLESS OF INDIVIDUAL

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.172
CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS ISN'T ABOUT

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.474
POLITICAL ASYLUM. THIS IS ABOUT

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:41.543
A LAW TEMPORARY PROTECTED

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:44.112
STATUS, ESTABLISHED IN 1990,

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:46.314
REPEATEDLY SUPPORTED BY

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:47.382
BIPARTISAN MAJORITIES IN

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:49.984
CONGRESS, TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:52.153
FROM COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS A

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.822
THREAT OF REPRESSION,

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:56.391
AUTHORITARIANISM OR DISASTER,

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:57.826
THAT WE PROVIDE THOSE TEMPORARY

01:24:57.892 --> 01:24:59.060
PROTECTED STATUS. AND I THINK

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:02.130
THAT IF WE LOOK AT YEMEN, IF WE

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.265
LOOK AT VENEZUELA, IF WE LOOK

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.233
AT HAITI, WE LOOK AT NICARAGUA,

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.935
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:08.870
CONDITIONS STILL EXIST WHERE

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.606
THESE PROTECTIONS ARE REQUIRED.

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:13.174
I REALLY WOULD WOULD CORRECT

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:15.109
THE MISINFORMATION THAT HAS

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:16.311
BEEN PUT OUT THERE. THIS IS

01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:19.080
ABOUT PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO WE

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:20.248
AS A COUNTRY HAVE SAID ARE

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:21.916
COMING FROM PLACES WHERE THEY

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:23.117
NEED PROTECTION. AND THESE

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:24.285
FOLKS CONTINUE TO NEED

01:25:24.352 --> 01:25:24.919
PROTECTION AND SHOULD NOT HAVE

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:27.121
IT REMOVED FROM THEM IN SUCH A

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:28.890
BLANKET WAY, IN A WAY THAT

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:31.159
WOULD CAUSE CHAOS, DEVASTATION

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:32.927
AND FAMILY SEPARATION. AND WITH

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.195
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:35.997
YOUR VOTE ON AGE EIGHT. THANK

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:37.232

MEMBER DEMAIO, YOU ARE

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:11.018
RECOGNIZED. I ENTERED POLITICS

01:43:11.084 --> 01:43:12.886
IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE CITY

01:43:12.953 --> 01:43:16.690
OF SAN DIEGO BECAUSE OF A

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:20.127
PENSION CRISIS. WHERE THE CITY

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:22.496
BASICALLY GAVE OUT BENEFITS,

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:24.298
GOLD PLATED BENEFITS THAT WERE

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:26.500
NOT AFFORDABLE TO TAXPAYERS.

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:29.202
AND ONE OF THE BIG DEBATES WE

01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:31.204
HAD WAS, WELL, WHY DON'T WE

01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:32.039
JUST SIMPLY ABROGATE THE

01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:33.640
CONTRACTS AND JUST REFORM ALL

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:35.008
THE BENEFITS? AND OF COURSE, WE

01:43:35.075 --> 01:43:36.009
HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE

01:43:36.076 --> 01:43:37.778
CALIFORNIA RULE THAT SAYS

01:43:37.844 --> 01:43:39.046
EXISTING EMPLOYEES GET THE

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:42.149
BENEFITS. THE VERY FIRST DAY

01:43:42.215 --> 01:43:43.817
THEY WALK INTO EMPLOYMENT. AND

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.953
FOR 30 YEARS, YOU'RE NOT

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:47.754
ALLOWED TO DIMINISH THOSE

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:50.223
BENEFITS. THE CALIFORNIA RULE

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.292
IS CRUSHING US, PUTTING MANY

01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:53.460
SYSTEMS ON THE BRINK OF

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:55.495
BANKRUPTCY. BUT IT IS STILL ON

01:43:55.562 --> 01:43:57.030
THE BOOKS. IT IS FRUSTRATING,

01:43:57.097 --> 01:43:59.967
BUT IT'S ON THE BOOKS. WHAT

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:01.568
PEOPLE WILL ARGUE IS, WELL, FOR

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:03.370
NEW EMPLOYEES, YOU CAN CHANGE

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:06.239
THE THE THE AGREEMENT. YOU CAN

01:44:06.306 --> 01:44:09.109
OFFER NEW HIRES A 401 K, YOU

01:44:09.176 --> 01:44:11.945
CAN OFFER NEW HIRES, A SLIGHTLY

01:44:12.012 --> 01:44:14.615
REFORMED OR REDUCED DEFINED

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:17.050
BENEFIT. FRUSTRATING BECAUSE

01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:19.086
YOU HAVE TO WAIT 30 YEARS TO

01:44:19.152 --> 01:44:19.953
ACTUALLY GET THE FULL AMOUNT OF

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.388
SAVINGS AND TO CHANGE THE

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:23.624
SYSTEM. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:24.858
BEEN LIVING UNDER. WHAT THIS

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:28.128
BILL DOES, SB 301 IS IT SAYS,

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:29.997
NO, YOU CAN'T EVEN REFORM

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:32.366
BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:34.001
EVEN HIRED YET. SO IN OTHER

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.936
WORDS, WHAT YOU ARE DOING BY

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:37.371
VOTING FOR THIS BILL IS YOU'RE

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:39.339
PUTTING THE FINAL LAYER OF

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:41.375
CEMENT ON THE COFFIN OF THE

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.944
TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:47.080
FORCING THEM TO LITERALLY HAVE

01:44:47.147 --> 01:44:49.049
HANDCUFFS. THAT WHATEVER THE

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:50.250
PENSION BENEFITS ARE TODAY,

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:53.253
THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT IS

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.154
CONTINUED OR BETTER. THE DOOR

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:56.223
ONLY SWINGS ONE WAY. IT ONLY

01:44:56.289 --> 01:44:59.092
GETS BETTER, MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:03.664
TAXPAYERS. I DON'T THINK THAT

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:06.133
THIS WILL CHANGE MANY PEOPLE'S

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:07.734
VOTES, BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:08.969
THE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE UNIONS

01:45:09.036 --> 01:45:12.039
CALL THE SHOTS ON THESE ISSUES,

01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:14.875
BUT I AT LEAST. MR. DEMAIO. MR.

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:17.310
DEMAIO, YOU ARE OUT OF ORDER.

01:45:17.377 --> 01:45:18.812
PLEASE DO NOT IMPUGN THE

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:20.981
MOTIVES OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. I

01:45:21.048 --> 01:45:22.916
THINK THE PUBLIC DESERVES THE

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:26.219
TRUTH AS TO WHO HAS INFLUENCE

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:26.953
ON THIS ISSUE OF PENSION

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:30.157
BENEFITS, AND THAT TRUTH MUST

01:45:30.223 --> 01:45:31.825
BE SPOKEN AND UNDERSTOOD

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:33.326
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SAY,

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:34.961
WHY WOULD MY LEGISLATOR VOTE

01:45:35.028 --> 01:45:37.597
THAT WAY? WELL, THIS IS THE

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:40.167
REASON WHY. I'M PUTTING IT ON

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:43.203
RECORD THAT AS YOU CAST THIS

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:45.772
VOTE, YOU ARE SLAPPING

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:48.408
HANDCUFFS ON EVERY SINGLE

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:49.810
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER THAT THEY

01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:52.379
ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO PAY

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:54.848
FOR THESE BENEFITS. OR BETTER,

01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:57.484
EVEN IF IT'S A NEW HIRE, WE

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:58.819
SHOULD NOT BE ADOPTING THIS.

01:45:58.885 --> 01:46:00.253
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN JUST PAUSE

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.055
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:04.324
ABOUT TO DO, THAT THIS IS WRONG,

01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:06.359
AND IT VERY WELL MAY FACILITATE

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:08.195
THE BANKRUPTCY OF A LOT OF

01:46:08.261 --> 01:46:10.030

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:29.629
RECOGNIZED, SIR. I UNDERSTAND

01:59:29.695 --> 01:59:30.930
THE SENATOR'S INTENT BEHIND

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:34.066
THIS BILL TO REDUCE THE SALE OF

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:36.135
STOLEN GOODS, BUT LET'S THINK

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:38.037
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. WE

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:39.839
HAVE A CRIME WAVE IN THE STATE

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:41.474
OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF REALLY

01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:42.275
BAD POLICIES, IN PART IMPOSED

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:45.177
BY THIS BODY AND LOCAL

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:46.212
GOVERNMENTS. AND INSTEAD OF

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:48.147
DEALING WITH THE CRIME WAVE, WE

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:51.017
GO TO LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES AND

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:52.919
SAY, WE HAVE A NEW REGULATION

01:59:52.985 --> 01:59:55.121
YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. YOU

01:59:55.187 --> 01:59:56.956
HAVE TO GET A SECOND PERMIT TO

01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:59.559
SELL THESE COMMONLY STOLEN

01:59:59.625 --> 02:00:01.527
ITEMS. THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT

02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:03.930
YOU MIGHT BE BREAKING THE LAW.

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:05.298
SO WE HAVE A PERMIT THAT YOU

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:07.934
HAVE TO PULL AND AND PAY MONEY

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.336
TO GET. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE

02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:12.972
THE PERMIT, BECAUSE LORD KNOWS

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:14.273
WE HAVE WE HAVE ENOUGH

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:16.042
COMPLICATED RULES IN THIS STATE,

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:17.209
AND IT'S HARD FOR BUSINESS

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:19.178
OWNERS TO KEEP UP WITH THEM. IF

02:00:19.245 --> 02:00:20.780
YOU DON'T GET A PERMIT, YOU

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:23.683
HAVE COMMITTED A MISDEMEANOR.

02:00:23.749 --> 02:00:24.183
WE ARE WE ARE LITERALLY

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:25.985
CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:27.887
JUST SIMPLY TRYING TO RUN THEIR

02:00:27.954 --> 02:00:30.289
SMALL BUSINESS. WITH THIS BILL,

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:31.123
THE MORE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE

02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:32.825
IS, LET'S CRACK DOWN ON THE

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:36.596
CRIME WAVE, BUT INSTEAD WE'RE

02:00:36.662 --> 02:00:37.930
ADDING ANOTHER PERMIT, ANOTHER

02:00:37.997 --> 02:00:39.365
REGULATION, AND ANOTHER

02:00:39.432 --> 02:00:41.267

THE SENATOR'S INTENT IS

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:49.175
PROBABLY WORTHY, BUT I DON'T

02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:51.510
THINK THAT THIS IS THE POLICY

02:00:51.577 --> 02:00:53.512
THAT WILL GET TO THE ROOT CAUSE

02:00:53.579 --> 02:00:55.948
