HERE ON THE COMMITTEE HEARING

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:14.838
IS EDUCATION AND FINDING A

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:17.241
PATHWAY TO SOLVING A VERY

00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:20.944
COMPLEX SPACE OF FINANCING,

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:22.246
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FROM

MIXED HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.352
FIRST TIME HOMEBUYER PROGRAMS.

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.320
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SPENT THE

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:32.723
LAST 30 YEARS PRIOR TO ARRIVING

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:35.392

OCCUPYING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.529
DEVELOPMENT, IT IS SUCH AN

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:41.598
HONOR. I FEEL LIKE I'M AT A

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:43.467
HOUSING FAMILY REUNION TODAY TO

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:46.570

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.272
PEOPLE THAT I HAD THE HONOR AND

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:50.240
PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH ALONG

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:57.080
GREAT JOY TO ME TO TO BE IN A

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:58.615
SPACE AGAIN, TO GATHER WITH

00:46:58.682 --> 00:46:59.917

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.694
GOING ON PRESENT AND WHAT WE

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:13.163
PLAN TO DO FOR THE FUTURE.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.165
TODAY, MANY CALIFORNIANS WILL

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:17.634
WILL NEVER SEE THE KEYS TO

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:19.203
THEIR FIRST HOME. THE AMERICAN

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:21.305
DREAM ISN'T JUST DELAYED. WE'RE

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:24.341
WE'RE PRICED OUT. AND THE COST

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:26.743
TO BUY AND RENT A HOME IN

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.378
CALIFORNIA FROM GROCERIES AND

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:30.147
JUST THE COST OF LIVING IS

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:32.416
EXACERBATING THE HOUSING MARKET.

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:34.585
AS WE HAVE SEEN, THE HOUSING

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.086
PRICES OF THE MEDIAN HOME NOW

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:39.356
HAS GONE UP TO 884,000

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:40.390
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:41.592
CALIFORNIA AND THE VARIOUS

00:47:41.658 --> 00:47:44.561
COMMUNITIES HIGHER. WE KNOW

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:45.796
THAT DECADES OF INSUFFICIENT

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.130
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION HAS LEFT

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.299
US WITH SEVERE UNDERSUPPLY OF

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.434
HOUSING, LEADING TO HIGHER

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.002
PRICES AND HIGHER RATES OF

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:53.370
HOMELESSNESS. TO KEEP UP WITH

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:55.372
DEMAND, THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:56.506
HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:56.974
DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.308
CALIFORNIA MUST PLAN FOR

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.210
DEVELOPMENT OF MORE THAN 2.5

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.678
MILLION HOMES OVER THE NEXT

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:04.181
EIGHT YEARS, 1 MILLION OF WHICH

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:06.216
MUST BE MET WITH THE NEEDS OF

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:07.384
LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:09.853
LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN SEVERAL

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.256
RECENT ACTIONS TO SPUR HOUSING

00:48:12.322 --> 00:48:13.290
DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.625
REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.159
INCREASE DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:18.362
VIA REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS,

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:19.162
ALLOCATION PROCESS AND HOUSING

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:22.299
ELEMENT LAWS, EXPANDING AND

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:23.133
STREAMLINING LOCAL HOUSING

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.502
APPROVAL PROCESS AT MULTIPLE

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:27.371
PHASES, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL

00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:29.473
FUNDING WHEN POSSIBLE FOR

00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:30.240
DEVELOPMENTS AND AFFORDABLE

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:33.477
HOUSING THROUGH THE HOUSING

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:35.812
COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR, MANY

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:37.414
OF YOU SAW SEVERAL BILLS THAT

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:38.415
CAME THROUGH WITH MY COLLEAGUES,

00:48:38.482 --> 00:48:40.951
SO THERE IS A CONCENTRATED

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:42.853
EFFORT AT ALL LEVELS AT THE

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:46.857
STATE LEGISLATURE TO FIND

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:48.425
SOLUTIONS TO THE FINANCING

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:50.494
CRISIS, TO THE DEVELOPMENT

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.496
CRISIS AND THE CONSTRUCTION

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:54.398
CRISIS. WE NEED TO RECALIBRATE.

00:48:54.464 --> 00:48:56.433
AND THIS COMMITTEE IS HOPEFUL

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.102
THE PATHWAY TO RECALIBRATING

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:02.139
SOLID POLICY WITH SOLID

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:04.107
SOLUTIONS. OUR GOAL AT THE END

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:07.010
OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO BE ABLE

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:10.747
TO COLLECTIVELY BRING A THINK

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:11.815
TANK, AN EDUCATIONAL

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:14.251
OPPORTUNITY, A SPACE FOR THE

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:16.086

HERE AND TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:22.492
A CONCRETE RECOMMENDATION TO

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.861
THE LEGISLATURE AND TO OUR

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:28.165
GOVERNOR OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:31.435
MOVING FORWARD. AND SO I HOPE

00:49:31.501 --> 00:49:32.402
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:34.538
GATHERING DATA TO BE ABLE TO

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:37.240
ACTUALLY PUT A PROPOSAL OF

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:40.510
ACTION PLANS TOGETHER. I'M

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:42.813
GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER,

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:43.980

MY COLLEAGUES TO BE HERE TO

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:59.363
TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS SPACES

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:02.132
IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:04.434
NOW PASS IT ON TO MY CO-CHAIR

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.170
TO SAY A FEW WORDS, AND ALSO

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:10.340
HAVE HIS OPENING REMARKS. THANK

00:50:10.407 --> 00:50:12.209
YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM CO-CHAIR.

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:14.378
IT IS. LET ME JUST BEGIN BY

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:15.245
SAYING IT'S AN HONOR TO SERVE

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:18.281
WITH YOU IN THIS CAPACITY AND

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:20.517
YOUR EXPERTISE. YOU ARE VERY

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:23.453
HUMBLE IN IN LAYING OUT JUST

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.455
HOW WELL VERSED YOU ARE IN

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.691
THESE ISSUES. UNLIKE ME. AND I

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:30.227
DO COME TO THIS DEBATE WITH A

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:33.397
BEGINNER'S AND A NOVICE MINDSET.

00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:35.232
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:37.401
VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AND IT'S

00:50:37.467 --> 00:50:38.668
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY PERSONAL

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:40.837
TO ME. YOU KNOW, A LITTLE OVER

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.672
A DECADE AGO, YOU KNOW, MY WIFE

00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:44.408
AND I BARELY GOT INTO OUR FIRST

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:46.576
HOME. YOU KNOW, WE USED BUBBLE

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:47.310
GUM, SCOTCH TAPE AND ALL THE

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:49.312
MONEY WE HAD IN OUR BANK

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:51.081
ACCOUNTS TO TO BARELY GET INTO

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:54.017
A HOME THAT WAS AT THAT TIME

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:55.285
SEEMED OVERLY PRICED AND TOO

00:50:55.352 --> 00:50:59.556
SMALL, AND. WE ARE FIGURING OUT

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:02.092
THESE MIX. DOES THAT WORK NOW?

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:05.061
AND FAST FORWARD, YOU KNOW, 11

00:51:05.128 --> 00:51:06.963
YEARS LATER AND I HAVE THREE

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.167
KIDS WHO I AM VERY WORRIED

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:14.504
ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.506
TO BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME, LIVE

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.742
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:20.343
GREW UP IN. AND JUST FROM TEN,

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.579
11 YEARS AGO, IT HAS GOTTEN

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:23.613
SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER. IF I

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.316
DIDN'T BUY MY FIRST HOME WHEN I

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:28.185
DID, THERE'S ZERO CHANCE I

00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:30.353
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.588
TODAY. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:33.190
JUST IN THE RANKS IN OUR

00:51:33.256 --> 00:51:34.558
LEGISLATURE. OUR RENTERS CAUCUS

00:51:34.624 --> 00:51:36.493
HAS GOTTEN BIGGER EVERY YEAR.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.296
MORE AND MORE LEGISLATORS CAN

00:51:39.362 --> 00:51:40.597
BARELY AFFORD TO LIVE IN THEIR

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:43.166
DISTRICTS. AND THIS IS

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:45.035
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS URGENT

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:45.502
ATTENTION. AND WE WANT

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:47.604
DELIVERABLES, AND WE WANT TO BE

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.172
ABLE TO DELIVER FOR THE CURRENT

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:51.541
CROP OF HOME BUYERS. AND THOSE

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:52.375
ARE WORKING FAMILIES THAT ARE

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:54.044
STRUGGLING, SPENDING TOO MUCH

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.613
ON RENT AND CAN'T GET INTO A

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.447
HOME OF THEIR OWN. AND IT'S

00:51:57.514 --> 00:51:59.216
ALSO THE NEXT GENERATION, THE

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:01.351
GENERATION AFTER THAT. AND IF

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:02.519
WE DON'T DELIVER AFFORDABLE

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:03.553
HOUSING AND FIGURE THIS OUT

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.388
VERY QUICKLY, WE'RE NEVER GOING

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:07.123
TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND SO I

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.159
THINK THIS IS AN URGENT TOPIC,

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:10.894
AND I'M SO GLAD THAT MANY OF

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.062
OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE AGREED TO

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:13.363
SERVE ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:15.265
WE APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:16.800
HELPING US FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS.

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:18.368
AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE

00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:20.337
SPENT YEARS WORKING ON THIS,

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:22.539
BUT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:24.608
DELIVERING FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS.

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:27.177
AND IF THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:29.312
I THINK ALL OF US HEAR ABOUT

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:31.181
MORE THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE, IT'S

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:33.416
IT'S HOUSING. IT'S THE

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:34.651
AVAILABILITY TO FIND AFFORDABLE

00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:36.786
HOUSING ACROSS THE BOARD. SO

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:40.056
THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO BE A

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:41.424
VERY INFORMATIVE SELECT

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:44.528
COMMITTEE, A VERY INTENT ON

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:46.830
SOLVING PROBLEMS. SELECT

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:47.464
COMMITTEE. AND I COULDN'T THINK

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:50.500

THAT'S CREATED 1988, AND THAT'S

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:57.213
100 YOUNGER. YOUNGER. AND OUR

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.916

LOW INCOMES. SO WE DO THAT IN A

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.889
NUMBER OF WAYS. WE CREATE

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:08.024
RESERVE HOUSING, AFFORDABLE

00:57:08.091 --> 00:57:12.862
HOMES. WE TRAIN 3000 STAFF. FOR

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.531

HAVE FINANCIAL TECHNICAL

00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:31.047
ASSISTANCE FOR HOUSING FINANCE.

00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:33.650
WE ALSO HAVE APPLIED RESEARCH

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.485
AND SUSTAINABLE HOUSING. AND

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:37.287
PART OF WHAT WE DO, WE ALSO

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:38.488
HAVE A NUMBER OF DATA TOOLS

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:40.223
THAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:43.660
THREE. ONE IS AFFORDABLE

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:44.360
HOUSING APP WHERE WE MAP OUT

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:47.363
ALL THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.432
STATIONS AS WELL AS THE HOUSING.

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:54.470
DATA RELATED TO HOUSEHOLD

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.372
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ALL THE

00:57:56.439 --> 00:58:13.223
DATA.

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:23.333
LEVEL AS WELL AS THE

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:27.303
COUNTY LEVEL. I DO WANT TO DO A

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:30.039
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT SETTING,

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:32.876
TALKING ABOUT HOUSING AS A

00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:33.843
LARGEST EXPENSE FOR HOUSEHOLDS.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:34.444
AFFORDABILITY HAS BEEN A HUGE

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:37.213
ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIANS TODAY,

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.515
AS WELL AS A PRIORITY FOR THE

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:42.318
LEGISLATURE THIS SESSION. AND

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:44.287
HOUSEHOLD EXPENSE OF HOUSING IS

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:46.389
THE LARGEST EXPENSE. I'VE DONE

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.057
A LOT OF WORK ON THE AFFORDABLE

00:58:48.124 --> 00:58:49.192
HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.360
PROGRAM THIS YEAR AS IT IS

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:51.561
FUNDED, THE CAP AND TRADE

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:53.196
PROGRAM, AND WE PUBLISHED AN

00:58:53.263 --> 00:58:55.265
IMPACT REPORT EVERY YEAR. SO

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:56.332
YOU CAN SEE A GRAPHIC THAT WE

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:59.235
USE ON SLIDE NUMBER FOUR,

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:00.336
SHOWING A NUMBER OF THE

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:01.104
DIFFERENT CO-BENEFITS AND

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:03.239
BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM. IT'S A

00:59:03.306 --> 00:59:04.474
PRETTY COMPLICATED SLIDE THOUGH.

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.175
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE NUMBER

00:59:06.242 --> 00:59:08.244
SPECIFICALLY, WHICH IS THE

00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:12.248
$10,000 $10,566 PER YEAR.

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:14.350
THAT'S THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:17.220
SAVINGS A HOUSEHOLD OBTAINS BY

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:19.222
LIVING IN A IN A IN HOUSING

00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:22.392
SITUATION FUNDED BY ASIC. I'M A

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:23.559
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROFESSOR AS

00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:25.261
WELL. I TEACH CHEMISTRY AT THE

00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:26.396
LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:28.631
AREA, AND $10,000 A YEAR FOR

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:30.867
ONE OF MY STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:32.769
A SINGLE PARENT IS ENOUGH FOR

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:33.536
TWO YEARS OF THE COMMUNITY

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:35.371
COLLEGE AND TWO YEARS AT A UC

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:38.141
OR CSU. THAT'S ENOUGH MONEY FOR

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:40.043
THEM TO GET THEIR DEGREE AND

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.744
PROVIDE A BETTER ECONOMIC

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.180
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. THE NEXT

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:48.351
SLIDE THANK. YEAH ECONOMIC

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.053
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. RIGHT.

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:51.587
AND THAT'S WHY IN THE NEXT

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:52.488
SLIDE YOU COULD SEE THAT

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:53.489
HOUSING ISN'T JUST HOUSING.

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.491
WHEN WE FIND HOUSING IT'S ALSO

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:58.895
INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES. SO

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:02.565
NEXT SLIDE. IT'S INVESTING IN

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:03.333
COMMUNITIES RIGHT. WE'RE

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.434
INVESTING IN INDIVIDUALS AND

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.135
HOUSEHOLDS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:08.171
ALL THE CO-BENEFITS AROUND

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.472
THERE, INCLUDING THE LOCAL

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:11.174
TAXES AND THE JOBS CREATED,

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.408
IT'S REALLY A COMMUNITY

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:13.810
DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE. WE INVEST

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.311
IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO ON

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:18.081
THE NEXT SLIDE, YOU CAN SEE

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:20.249
SOME OF THE DATA POINTS YOU CAN

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:23.119
GET IN THE ON OUR WEBSITE, ONE

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.254
BEING THE AFFORDABLE HOMES

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:27.423
SHORTFALL, WHERE WE HAVE AT

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.291
LEAST 1 MILLION MORE HOMES FOR

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:30.259
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT WE

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:31.227
NEED IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ALSO

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:34.197
LOOK AT COST BURDEN PER PER

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:37.400
INCOME LEVEL HERE, LOOKING AT

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.802
AS YOU DECREASE IN HOUSEHOLD

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.204
INCOME, YOU INCREASE IN COST

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:45.241
BURDEN. SO THE NEXT FEW SLIDES

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.543
I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:48.678
ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.179
FINANCE. AGAIN THIS IS JUST TO

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:52.348
LEVEL SET THE CONVERSATION HERE.

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.616
I'M NOT GOING SUPER IN-DEPTH.

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.251
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.720
THAT CAN GO WAY MORE IN DEPTH

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.489
THAN I CAN. BUT JUST TO LEVEL

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:01.424
SET THE CONVERSATION. SO THE

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.426
BIG PICTURE HERE IS THAT THE

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.161
RENTS REQUIRED TO BUILD HOUSING

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:07.163
ARE GENERALLY TOO HIGH TO REACH

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.732
ALL POPULATIONS. SO IF YOU LOOK

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.267
AT MARKET RATE HOUSING, THE

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:12.268
RENTS ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO PAY

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.370
FOR A LARGE MORTGAGE OR ATTRACT

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:15.538
PRIVATE EQUITY TO PAY FOR

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:18.341
UPFRONT COSTS OF CAPITAL. SO

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:19.475
THAT MEANS YOUR RENTS ARE HIGH

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.477
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FILL THE

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:23.212
ENTIRE FINANCING. YOU NEED TO

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:24.180
BUILD THE DEVELOPMENT. SO THE

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:26.149
FINANCING HERE IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:28.351
I WANT TO SAY IT'S SIMPLE, BUT

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.419
IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE IN

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.353
COMPARISON TO AFFORDABLE

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.221
HOUSING. IF YOU LOOK AT

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:33.289
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE ISSUE

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.223
HERE IS THAT RENTS ARE FAR

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.793
LOWER THAN MARKET RATE. SO YOUR

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:37.393
CASH FLOW IS GOING TO BE

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.295
INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A LARGE

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.830
MORTGAGE OR ATTRACT PRIVATE

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.298
EQUITY ENOUGH TO BUILD THE

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.232
DEVELOPMENT ITSELF. SO THAT'S

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:45.501
WHY YOU NEED PUBLIC SUBSIDY TO

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.770
DO THIS. AND THERE ARE A FEW

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:49.105
PROGRAMS BELOW THAT THAT YOU

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:50.440
CAN SEE, LIKE THE FEDERAL AND

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:51.607
STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:52.642
CREDIT, WHICH ATTRACTS

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.610
INVESTORS TO INVEST IN

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:55.278
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THERE'S

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.580
SUBSIDY PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE

01:01:57.647 --> 01:01:59.582
OFFERS, LIKE HCD PROGRAMS, THE

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:01.350
FEDERAL PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:02.285
LOCAL PUBLIC SOURCES. I THINK

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.787
ALSO THINK OF RENTAL SUBSIDY IN

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:05.922
THE SENSE OF PROJECT BASED

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:09.225
VOUCHERS. SO IN THE NEXT SLIDE,

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.027
YOU KIND OF SEE WHAT WE CALL A

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.328
CAPITAL STACK, WHERE YOU'RE

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.596
TRYING TO BUILD ENOUGH FUNDING

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:16.332
TO REACH 100%. SO IN THE MARKET

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.267
RATE SCENARIO, THE RENTS ARE

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.502
HIGH ENOUGH WHERE YOU CAN GET

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.170
ENOUGH CONVENTIONAL DEBT AND

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.639
INVESTORS ENOUGH TO GET TO 100%

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:24.407
WITHOUT NEEDING PUBLIC SUBSIDY.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.642
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.511
AFFORDABLE SPACE, YOU DO STILL

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.379
HAVE RENTAL INCOME, AND SO THEN

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:32.415
YOU STILL CAN GET A MORTGAGE.

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.083
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE BIG

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.451
ENOUGH TO FILL THE ENTIRE GAP

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:37.253
YOU HAVE THERE. THEN YOU HAVE

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.122
YOUR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:40.556
CREDIT, BUT YOU STILL HAVE A

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:42.225
GAP. AND THAT GAP NEEDS TO BE

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:44.360
FILLED BY OTHER SOURCES. AND WE

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.129
CALL THESE SOFT SOURCES. AND

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.164
THESE ARE WHERE A LOT OF STATE

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:49.232
SOURCES COME TOGETHER. LOCAL

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.733
SOURCES COME TOGETHER TO FILL

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.668
THAT GAP, TO GET TO 100%, TO

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:55.037
BUILD THE DEVELOPMENT. ON THE

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.240
NEXT SLIDE, YOU COULD SEE THAT

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:59.609
HOW MANY LAYERS OR HOW MANY

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:01.210
SOURCES ARE LAYERED TOGETHER IN

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.646
DEVELOPMENTS, ON AVERAGE, FROM

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:09.152
2018 TO 2024. AND WE CAN SEE ON WAS FIVE SOURCES OF

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:11.320
FUNDING USED TO BUILD A

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:13.489
DEVELOPMENT USE 12. THAT TAIL

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:16.726
IS REALLY, REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:17.326
SOLVED IN SOME WAYS. PART OF

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.395
THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.730
THOSE ARE NIGHTMARE SCENARIOS,

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:22.165
RIGHT? IF YOU'RE USING 12

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.366
SOURCES TO FUND A DEVELOPMENT

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.401
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:26.802
TIME, IT'S GOING TO INCREASE

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.437
COST QUITE A BIT. AND THEN FIVE

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:30.606
IS ALSO PRETTY HIGH. WE WANT TO

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.208
DECREASE THAT AS MUCH AS

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:33.476
POSSIBLE. ONE THING TO NOTE IS

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.378
THAT EACH SOURCE MAY HAVE ITS

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:37.180
OWN APPLICATION, ITS OWN RULES,

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:39.115
ITS OWN REGULATIONS, WHICH CAN

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:40.116
MAKE THE LAYERING DIFFICULT. I

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.318
WASN'T A BIG ATHLETE IN HIGH

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.253
SCHOOL. I WAS A NERDY GUY. I'M

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.256
STILL AM A NERDY GUY, BUT I

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.224
KNOW SOME FRIENDS WHO PLAYED

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:50.626
THREE SPORTS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:52.428
AND FOR DEVELOPMENTS, A SIMILAR

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.597
ASPECT WHERE YOU HAVE TO WIN AT

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:55.631
DIFFERENT COMPETITIONS IN

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:57.400
DIFFERENT WAYS, RIGHT? AND SO

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:58.167
FOR DEVELOPMENT TO WIN, YOU

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.303
HAVE TO WIN ALL THESE

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.337
COMPETITIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS,

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:02.572
AND IT TAKES A REALLY SPECIAL

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.907
DEVELOPMENT TO WIN ALL THOSE

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:05.775
COMPETITIONS IN A TIMELINE THAT

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:07.076
MAKES SENSE. ON THE NEXT SLIDE,

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:09.278
YOU COULD SEE WE'RE GOING TO

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:12.215
BUILD THIS CAPITAL STACK. WITH

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:14.317
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:15.351
HAVE, THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.220
PROGRAM BEING THE LOW INCOME

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:19.388
HOUSING TAX CREDIT. THIS IS A

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:20.089
FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT'S

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.691
ADMINISTERED TO THE STATES. THE

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:23.226
TREASURER'S OFFICE IS THE ONE

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.127
THAT DELIVERS THE PROGRAM. AND

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.596
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT ONES.

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:28.831
THERE'S A 9% PROGRAM AND THE 4%

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:31.200
PROGRAM. THE 9% PROGRAM IS A

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.168
COMPETITIVE PROGRAM, AND IT CAN

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:34.837
COVER AROUND 70% OF THE

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.973
DEVELOPMENT COST. THE 4%

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.174
PROGRAM IS NONCOMPETITIVE, AND

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.710
IT COVERS AROUND 35% OF THE

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:42.745
DEVELOPMENT. THE NUMBERS HERE

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.213
ARE JUST KIND OF ROUND NUMBERS

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.448
HERE. THEY'RE NOT EXACT. SO

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:47.516
TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. BUT

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:49.385
THE 4% PROGRAM MUST BE PAIRED

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:51.120
WITH TAX EXEMPT BONDS. AND

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:53.522
THOSE HAVE BEEN COMPETITIVE IN

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:55.157
THE PAST. SO IN THE PAST WE'VE

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.126
REACHED OUR LIMIT ON BONDS,

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:58.761
WHICH MADE US REACH OUR LIMIT

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.296
IN 4% CREDITS. HOWEVER, THANKS

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.365
TO A LOT OF PUSH FROM

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:03.733
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES,

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:04.867
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:06.502
SOME CHANGES RECENTLY TO THESE

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:07.737
PROGRAMS, SO IT GREATLY

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:09.071
EXPANDED BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS,

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:11.874
ONE BEING THE 12%. THE 9%

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:14.043
PROGRAM NOW HAS A 12.5%

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.711
INCREASE IN TAX CREDITS GOING

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:17.380
INTO THAT PROGRAM, AND THE 4%

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.148
PROGRAM BASICALLY DOUBLED, WE

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.384
LIKE TO SAY. SO NOW WE HAVE

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:22.752
MUCH MORE FEDERAL INVESTMENT

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.353
THAT CAN GO IN AFFORDABLE

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.488
HOUSING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.189
MORE. SO IT'S THAT MUCH MORE

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.958
IMPORTANT TO FILL THESE FUNDING

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:30.226
GAPS TO GET THIS FEDERAL

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:33.195
INVESTMENT COMING TO CALIFORNIA.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.498
ON THE NEXT SLIDE, WE COULD SEE

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:37.300
KIND OF WAYS TO KIND OF FILL

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:39.568
THAT GAP. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ALL

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:40.303
THE STATE HOUSING AGENCIES

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:41.037
ADMINISTER DIFFERENT PROGRAMS,

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.271
AND YOU HAVE THEM ALL

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:43.439
REPRESENTED HERE. MAYBE NOT ALL

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:45.308
OF THEM, BUT MANY OF THEM

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:46.375
REPRESENTED HERE WITH THE

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.977
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:48.544
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, THE

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.012
STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL, WHICH

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.147
ADMINISTERS THE ASIC PROGRAM,

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.316
WHICH I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:55.451
CALHFA AND THEN CDLAC AND TCAC.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.286
ONE OTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:58.321
THAT IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING

01:05:58.387 --> 01:05:59.221
IMPORTANT ARE THE

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.656
DECARBONIZATION RESOURCES THAT

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.792
THE STATES OFFER. HOWEVER,

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:05.161
THESE ARE LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:06.929
OF FUNDING THAT A DEVELOPER CAN

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.597
GET FOR THESE RESOURCES AND THE

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:10.399
RESTRICTIONS THERE. SO AS IS

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.435
BECOMING IMPORTANT, IT IS A

01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:13.336
CONSTANT BATTLE TO FEEL WHETHER

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:16.639
OR NOT IT'S WORTH IT FOR A

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:17.740
DEVELOPER TO APPLY FOR THESE

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.275
FUNDS. SO PUTTING IT ALL

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:20.643
TOGETHER ON THE NEXT SLIDE, YOU

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.278
COULD SEE YOU HAVE YOUR 4%

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.480
CREDITS AND THEN YOU HAVE STATE

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.082
FUNDING THAT'S COMING IN THERE.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:28.351
YOU OFTEN HAVE LOCAL FUNDING

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:29.452
COMING IN, AND YOU HAVE A

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:32.321
PRIVATE LOAN. AND I WANT TO

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:34.390
MAKE A COUPLE NOTES. ONE IS

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.124
THAT REMEMBER THAT EVERY

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.325
FUNDING SOURCE HAS THEIR OWN

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.361
RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT THEY

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:39.628
HAVE TO FOLLOW. SO THE MORE

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.430
STACKING AND THE MORE LAYERING

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:43.232
MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.501
LAYER. AND THEN THE OTHER THING

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:48.771
I WANT TO NOTE ON THE NEXT TWO

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.339
SLIDES IS THAT BOTH PRIVATE

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:51.674
FINANCING, LOCAL COMMUNITIES

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.209
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.211
ALL INVOLVED. OFTEN WHEN I TALK

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:56.345
TO FOLKS ABOUT AFFORDABLE

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:57.179
HOUSING, FINANCE, AND

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:58.214
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHO ARE

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.348
UNFAMILIAR WITH IT, THEY'RE

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:01.050
CONFUSED AS TO WHY THE STATE

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.351
HAS TO PAY ALL THIS MONEY FOR

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:04.420
HOUSING. BUT IN FACT, WE'RE

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:06.389
LEVERAGING A LOT OF OTHER

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:07.223
FUNDING SOURCES, RIGHT? WE'RE

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.258
GETTING RENTAL INCOME, AND

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:10.760
WE'RE LEVERAGING AS MUCH DEBT

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:12.261
AS POSSIBLE ALREADY IN WHEN

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:14.397
PRIVATE FUNDING. SO GIVING OUT

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:16.332
MORE LOANS MAY NOT BE AS

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:17.466
REASONABLE AS ONE MIGHT THINK,

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:18.501
BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.169
LEVERAGING AS MUCH DEBT OR

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:21.470
LEVERAGING OUR RENTAL INCOME TO

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.305
GET AS MUCH DEBT AS POSSIBLE.

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:25.808
WE ALSO ARE GETTING FEDERAL

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:26.475
MATCHING HERE IN THE PROGRAM

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.210
AND IN THE 9% PROGRAM. AND SO

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:30.179
THIS IDEA THAT THE STATE'S

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:31.480
FUNDING EVERYTHING, IT'S REALLY

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:34.150
THE STATE IS PROVIDING VERY A

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:36.719
VERY IMPORTANT FUNDING SOURCE,

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.087
WHICH FILLS A GAP IN WHICH WE

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:40.823
CAN USE A FEDERAL RESOURCES AND

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.124
LEVERAGE PRIVATE MONEY IN A WAY

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:43.325
THAT ACTUALLY MAKES A REALLY

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.461
TRUE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:47.229
IN THE BUILDING OF AFFORDABLE

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:51.033
HOUSING. ON THE NEXT SLIDE, YOU

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.502
COULD SEE. THIS ONE. YEAH, YOU

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:55.704
CAN SEE THE FUNDING PROFILE PER

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:56.639
HOME FINANCE WITH THE 4%

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:59.041
PROGRAM USING THE SAME DATASET,

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:02.678
THE 2018 TO 2024 DATA AND THE

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.280
MEDIAN TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:06.682
BEING $575,000 PER UNIT. AND

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:09.785
YOU COULD SEE ON THE LEFT THE

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.320
PERCENTAGES, THE AVERAGE

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.354
PERCENTAGES OF THE FUNDING

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:13.589
SOURCES GOING TO THE

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:14.657
DEVELOPMENT MAPPED ONTO THAT

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:16.325
TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST. SO

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:17.560
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF FEDERAL

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:19.428
MONEY COMING IN WITH 37% AND

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:22.398
THE STATE MONEY COMING IN WITH

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:24.333
AROUND WITH AROUND 21% AND

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.335
PRIVATE FUNDING COMING IN 27%.

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:28.370
IT IS REALLY A PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.339
PARTNERSHIP IN THIS WAY, AND

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.574
IT'S ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.374
TAKING PART IN AFFORDABLE

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:35.144
HOUSING. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.213
THE SLIDE, YOU COULD SEE THE

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.414
COSTS AND CONSTRUCTION BEING

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.816
QUITE, QUITE BIG IN THE HIGHEST

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:46.155
WITH 68%. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.356
NOTE ON THE NEXT SLIDE THAT

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:48.457
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:50.159
NECESSARILY MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.393
BUILD THAN MARKET RATE HOUSING,

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.429
DESPITE THE OTHER COSTS THAT

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:54.497
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN HAVE. I

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:55.331
THINK THERE'S CONVERSATIONS

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.465
HAPPENING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:58.501
NOT KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE

01:08:58.567 --> 01:08:59.301
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SPACE, THAT

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.569
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.170
INCREDIBLY MORE EXPENSIVE. WE

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:03.072
LOOKED AT DATA THAT THE TURNER

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:05.241
CENTER CREATED WHERE THEY

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:07.042
MODELED PROFORMAS FOR MARKET

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.611
RATE DEVELOPMENT. AGAIN, THESE

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.379
ARE MODELS. THESE AREN'T

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:11.213
ACTUALS. IT'S REALLY HARD TO

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.649
GET ACTUALS HERE. AND WE LOOKED

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:14.550
AT LIGHT TECH PROJECTS. SO

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:16.051
THESE PROJECTS ARE FUNDED BY

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.186
LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT.

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:19.355
AND WE SAW FOR THE MOST PART

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:20.623
THEY WERE ON PAR WITH EACH

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.224
OTHER. AND IN SOME CASES, THE

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.659
LIGHT TECH DEVELOPMENTS ARE

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.127
EVEN CHEAPER TO BUILD PER UNIT

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.263
THAN THE MARKET RATE

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:31.200
COUNTERPARTS. THE LAST THING I

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:33.369
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS MAYBE

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:33.903
SOME SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS,

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:35.137
MOSTLY ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE

01:09:35.204 --> 01:09:36.438
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING, AND A

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:38.707
COUPLE IDEAS WHAT COULD BE DONE

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:39.642
IN THE FUTURE. AGAIN, THIS

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:41.110
COMMITTEE IS TALKING ABOUT THAT

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.078
QUITE A LOT, SO I DON'T NEED TO

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:45.147
GO TOO MUCH INTO THAT. BUT I DO

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:46.515
WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.450
BEEN DONE. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:49.118
OF FUNDING EFFICIENCIES

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:50.920
HAPPENING. AB 434 WAS PASSED

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:52.321
WHICH CREATED THE SUPERNOVA,

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:53.222
WHICH CONSOLIDATED A LOT OF THE

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:56.058
HCD PROGRAMS INTO ONE FUNDING

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.360
APPLICATION, EB 519 BY ASSEMBLY

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.362
MEMBER SHIAVO CREATED A WORKING

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:01.230
GROUP TO DISCUSS A ONE STOP

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:03.332
SHOP TYPE MODEL. AND THAT IS

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:05.434
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THE

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.169
GOVERNOR ALSO INDICATED

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:08.170
CREATING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:09.505
AND HOMELESSNESS AGENCY TO HELP

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:10.739
CREATE EFFICIENCIES WITHIN THE

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:13.208
SYSTEM. I LIKE TO CALL IT CHA.

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.610
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S BEEN STUCK

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:16.612
YET, BUT CHA HAS BEEN STUCK.

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.347
BUT I SAID IT HERE FIRST,

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:19.548
HOPEFULLY. AND THEN THERE'S

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:21.250
BEEN A LOT OF WAYS THAT FOLKS

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:22.885
HAVE STREAMLINED AFFORDABLE

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.486
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. LOOKING AT

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:26.288
AB 2011 BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:29.158
WICKS IN 2022, SB 423 BY

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:33.062
SENATOR WIENER IN 2023. THAT

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:36.498
CITATION IS WAY OFF, AND OTHER

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:37.499
STREAMLINING BILLS WHERE WE

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:38.467
COULD BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING,

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:41.670
WHERE IT MAKES SENSE IN A IN A

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:42.204
STREAMLINED WAY, AND THEN

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:44.340
THINGS THAT WE COULD DO IN THE

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:45.574
FUTURE. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:47.209
I'M SURE WE COULD TALK ABOUT

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:48.510
HERE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.145
TALK ABOUT. A COUPLE OF THEM

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:51.347
THAT POPPED OUT TO ME DURING

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.215
THIS PRESENTATION WAS THIS IDEA

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.350
OF COORDINATION WITH THE

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:54.950
TREASURER'S RESOURCES. RIGHT.

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:55.884
THE TREASURER'S RESOURCES WITH

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.252
THE TAX CREDITS ARE VERY

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:58.220
IMPORTANT TO THE AFFORDABLE

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.588
HOUSING SYSTEM. SO MAKING SURE

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:00.155
THEY'RE COORDINATED WITH THE

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:01.390
NEW HOUSING AND THE NEW HOUSING

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:03.892
AGENCY IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:04.493
AND ALSO INVESTING IN

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.594
INNOVATING STRATEGIES FOR THE

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.329
CONSTRUCTION COSTS TO GO DOWN.

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:08.897
THIS COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:09.431
MODULAR FACTORY BUILT AND

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:11.367
THINGS LIKE THAT. I'LL END IT

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:13.102
THERE. AND THANK YOU FOR

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:14.303
WORKING WITH ME WITH THE

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.371
PRESENTATION. AND HOPEFULLY

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:17.172
YOU'RE ABLE TO FOLLOW ME TO

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.441
SOME DEGREE ABOUT WHAT I WAS

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.276

GOING TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.483
THE PANELS AND THEN WE'LL SAVE

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:29.018
OUR QUESTIONS. WE'LL ALL TAKE

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:29.818
COPIOUS NOTES BECAUSE THIS IS

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:31.453
ALL VERY DIFFERENT AS WE MOVE

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.157
ALONG. SO. OKAY. WELL, HELLO

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:37.626

I'VE ACCESSED STATE FUNDING AS

AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER,

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.128
AND I'VE WORKED IN LOCAL

WE'VE ALL HEARD IN OUR SYSTEM.

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:34.650
AND I'VE ALSO CELEBRATED A LOT

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:37.219
OF THE STATE'S INNOVATIONS THAT

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.054
HAVE REALLY RESULTED IN

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.322
IMPORTANT, SAFE, AFFORDABLE

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:42.858
HOUSING FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:45.127
OUR STATE. SO IN MY NEW ROLE,

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.361
I'M DEEPLY COMMITTED TO MAKING

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.097
OUR SYSTEM WORK BETTER TO

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.431
CREATE A CALIFORNIA WHERE

EVERYONE HAS A PLACE TO CALL

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:54.403
HOME. BKSH OVERSEAS DEPARTMENTS

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.504

PUBLIC TRUST THROUGH

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:10.586
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY.

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:12.287
WE DO THIS BY PROVIDING

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.656
OVERSIGHT, THOUGHT LEADERSHIP,

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.625
AND COLLABORATION ON POLICY AND

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.861
OPERATIONS ACROSS HOUSING,

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.729
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND CIVIL

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.831

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:23.465
AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:25.200
ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:27.369
DEPARTMENTS, INCLUDING THE

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:28.604
STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.539
AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT,

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:31.340
WHICH DRIVES HOUSING POLICY AND

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:32.541
PROGRAM DELIVERY ACROSS THE

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.343
STATE. THE CIVIL RIGHTS

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.912
DEPARTMENT, WHICH ENFORCES FAIR

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:37.446
HOUSING LAWS AND ADDRESSES

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:38.781
DISCRIMINATION AND PARTNERSHIPS

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:41.049
WITH CALHFA, WHICH YOU'LL HEAR

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:43.152
FROM SOON, AND OTHER FINANCING

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.353
ENTITIES TO ENSURE THAT

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:46.021
RESOURCES ARE TRULY LEVERAGED

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:49.191
FOR PRESERVATION AND PRODUCTION.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.527
AND WE ALSO ALIGN WITH OTHER

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:52.261
STATE AGENCIES, LOCAL

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:54.663
GOVERNMENTS AND FEDERAL

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:55.464
PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.232
STRATEGIES ARE INTEGRATED. SO

01:13:57.299 --> 01:13:59.134
YOU HEARD ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:00.202
HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.538
GENERALLY AND SPECIFICALLY, YOU

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.406
KNOW, SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:06.108
IT, AND IT REALLY IS IT'S A

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.576
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. YOU

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:09.578
KNOW, A LOT OF THIS DOES NOT

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:10.345
GET BUILT WITHOUT PUBLIC

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:12.447
SUBSIDY. SO WE PLAY A REALLY

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:13.615
BIG ROLE IN THAT, BECAUSE

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:14.216
AFFORDABLE RENTS DO NOT COVER

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.385
THE FULL COST OF WHAT IT TAKES

01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:18.153
TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.488
AND MANAGE IT, ESPECIALLY IN

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:21.456
HIGH COST AREAS OF WHICH OUR

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:24.193
STATE HAS MANY. AT THE FEDERAL

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.561
LEVEL, WE'VE ALREADY HEARD

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:28.230
THESE TOOLS, BUT WE HAVE ACCESS

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.265
TO LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.534
CREDITS OR TECH TAX EXEMPT

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:34.303
BONDS, WHICH ALLOW DEVELOPERS

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:36.238
TO BORROW AT LOWER INTEREST

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:37.739
RATES. FEDERAL BLOCK GRANTS

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:40.042
LIKE CDBG AND HOME AND SECTION

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:41.243
EIGHT PROJECT BASED VOUCHERS TO

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.212
PROVIDE ONGOING RENT SUBSIDIES

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:45.113
FOR TENANTS MOST IN NEED. AND

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.249
THEN WE AS A STATE, LAYER OUR

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.318
OWN FINANCING, INCLUDING STATE

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:50.352

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.359
AS NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.094
OTHERS TO PROVIDE CAPITAL

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.662
SUBSIDIES. AND THEN WE ALSO

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:02.431
HAVE SPECIALIZED FUNDS TO

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:04.132

ALSO PROVIDES COMPLIMENTARY

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:10.639
LENDING AND BOND ISSUANCE, AND

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:13.775
HCD FILLS THAT FUNDING GAP AND

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.277
ENFORCES COMPLIANCE. AND THEN

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.545
ON TOP OF THAT, LOCAL

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:18.180
GOVERNMENTS MAY ALSO LAYER IN

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.182
THEIR OWN MONEY IF THEY HAVE

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:23.218
THEM. SO IDEALLY, THIS SYSTEM

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:25.554
WORKS PERFECTLY AND THERE WOULD

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:27.289
BE NO REASON FOR US TO BE HERE

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.691
TODAY. BUT AS WE KNOW IT DOES

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:32.227
NOT, AND OUR HOUSING FINANCE

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:36.565
SYSTEM IS STRESSED. IT'S IT'S A

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:37.299
STATEWIDE REFLECTION OF A

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.167
LARGER NATIONAL CRISIS. A LOT

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:41.169
OF COMMUNITIES ARE FACING A

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.639
HOUSING CRISIS, AND WE'RE ALSO

FACING RISING INTEREST RATES,

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.242
RISING CONSTRUCTION COSTS,

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:50.812
LABOR SHORTAGES. EVERYTHING IS

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.748
MAKING BUILDING HOUSING HARDER

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:55.684
AND MORE EXPENSIVE. THE CHAIR

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:56.485
MENTIONED ALREADY, OUR

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.120
STATEWIDE HOUSING PLAN HAS A

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.489
GOAL OF PRODUCING 2.5 MILLION

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:03.158

INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. YOU KNOW,

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:08.397
WE'RE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:09.831
TOWARDS THAT. WE'RE LAYING

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:12.100
IMPORTANT GROUNDWORK NOW, BUT

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.336
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO DO. AND

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:15.570
OUR FINANCING TOOLS

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.239
SPECIFICALLY ARE OFTEN

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:19.374
MISMATCHED TO THE SCALE AND THE

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.143
SPEED THAT'S NECESSARY TO

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:23.312
RESPOND TO THIS NEED. AND THEY

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:25.213
DON'T ALWAYS WORK WELL TOGETHER,

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.149

WENT WITH, HOW THE PROGRAMS

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.208
WORK. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:15.243
RESOURCES THAT WE ALLOCATE AT

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.379

ASSETS THAT CAN BE USED FOR A

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:32.127
VARIETY OF PURPOSES. THE VAST

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:34.196
MAJORITY OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.463
USING ARE TAXES AND BOND

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.232
FINANCING TOOLS FOR, FOR THE

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:39.334
LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE BEEN FOR

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:42.103
MULTIFAMILY RENTAL HOUSING. AS

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.405
ANDREW MENTIONED, THOSE ARE

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:45.173
PAIRED AND MUST BE PAIRED WITH

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.176
THE 4% TAX CREDIT THAT IS ALSO

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:50.412
FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED. THE WAY

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.247
THE SYSTEM GENERALLY WORKS IS

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:55.083
THE APPLICANT IS GOING TO

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:57.285
RECEIVE TAX CREDITS. THE TAX

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:59.454
CREDITS HAVE THEY HAVE BROUGHT

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.255
IN INVESTOR DOLLARS THAT ARE

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:02.290
THE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.393
SIDE, THEY'RE GOING TO BENEFIT

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.595
FROM THE TAX CREDIT THEMSELVES.

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:07.629
AND IN EXCHANGE, THEY'RE

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.164
PROVIDING EQUITY INTO THE

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.198
PROJECT THAT THEN CAN BE

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:12.400
LEVERAGED ALONG WITH SORT OF

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:15.303
THE RENTAL INCOME TO TO GET

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:16.571
ADDITIONAL PRIVATE DEBT, TO

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.039
SUPPORT PRIVATE DEBT. I THINK,

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:21.810
YOU KNOW, FOR THE YEARS 2010 TO

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:24.312
2020, OUR BOND SYSTEM WAS

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:26.114
GENERALLY UNDERSUBSCRIBED. AND

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:28.583
A LARGE REASON FOR THIS WAS DUE

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.452
TO A LACK OF ADDITIONAL SOFT

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:33.255
SOURCES THAT WERE IN THE SYSTEM.

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.624
AND SO WE WERE DOING WE WERE

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:36.258
CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:38.526
TO BRING MORE DEMAND INTO THE

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:40.228
SYSTEM. ALL OF THAT SORT OF

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:42.264
COLLIDED BEAUTIFULLY AROUND

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:45.000
2018, WHERE WE HAD ADDITIONAL

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:47.102
SOURCES COMING IN FROM CALHFA.

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:48.536
CALHFA HAD ADDITIONAL SOURCES

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:51.106
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO BRING

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.240
INTO THE SYSTEM. HCD HAD

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.175
ADDITIONAL SOURCES TO BRING IN

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.144
TO THE SYSTEM, AND WE HAD MANY

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:57.212
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT REALLY

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:58.446
STARTED PUTTING MORE LOCAL

01:21:58.513 --> 01:21:59.681
DOLLARS TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:02.350
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AS A

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:04.219
RESULT OF THAT, BOTH OUR 9%

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:05.287
PROGRAM, WHICH REALLY IS JUST

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.455
MORE TAX CREDITS THAT GO INTO

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:08.056
EACH DEVELOPMENT COMPARED TO

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:10.659
THE 4%, BOTH THAT PROGRAM AND

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:13.495
OUR BOND SLASH 4% PROGRAMS HAVE

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.263
BEEN DRASTICALLY OVERSUBSCRIBED

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:18.933
SINCE 2020, AT A RATE OF ABOUT

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.103
THREE OR 4 TO 1. SO, YOU KNOW,

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:24.339
WE'VE HAD TO CDLAC PRIOR TO

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:27.208
I'VE BEEN AT THE TCAC NOW FOR A

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:29.344
YEAR AND A HALF. SO PRIOR TO MY

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:30.478
TIME THERE, CDLAC HAD TO

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:31.313
DRASTICALLY CHANGE THE PROGRAM

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:34.382
TO ACCOMMODATE THIS NEW DEMAND

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:37.218
AND ESSENTIALLY PUT TOGETHER BY

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:40.522
2022 A MORE SORT OF A MORE

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.490
THOUGHTFUL SYSTEM AS TO HOW DO

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:44.759
WE PRIORITIZE AND ALLOCATE

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:45.960
THESE LIMITED RESOURCES FOR

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:49.130
BOTH THE 4% PROGRAM AND THE 9%

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:51.266
PROGRAM? WE DO THAT BY SETTING

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.435
PUTTING ASIDE BONDS OR TAX

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:56.705
CREDITS TO SERVE PARTICULAR

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:59.140
STATE POLICY GOALS. WE SET

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:01.843
ASIDE FUNDS FOR TO SUPPORT

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:04.679
HOMELESS OR HOUSING THAT IS

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:06.081
SUPPORTING FORMERLY HOMELESS

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.682
INDIVIDUALS. WE SET ASIDE

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:10.318
RESOURCES FOR EXTREMELY LOW

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:12.120
INCOME AND VERY LOW INCOME

01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:13.421
HOUSEHOLDS, OR PROJECTS

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.757
SUPPORTING THOSE HOUSEHOLDS.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.126
AND WE HAVE A SET ASIDE, EVEN

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.228
FOR CALHFA, SO THAT THEY CAN

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:22.230
PAIR THEIR PROGRAMS WITH OUR

01:23:22.297 --> 01:23:24.566
PROGRAMS AND MORE EFFICIENTLY

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:25.233
WORK TOGETHER TO GET THOSE

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.635
FUNDS OUT THE DOOR AND TO

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:29.270
SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:31.606
BOTH PROGRAMS ALSO HAVE A

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:32.407
GEOGRAPHIC ALLOCATION TO ENSURE

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:35.510
THAT WE'RE MAKING WE'RE GETTING

01:23:35.577 --> 01:23:37.278
THESE CRITICAL DOLLARS TO ALL

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:39.247
CORNERS OF THE STATE. EVERY

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.682
COMMUNITY HAS AFFORDABLE

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:41.483
HOUSING CHALLENGES, AND IT'S

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.885
IMPORTANT THAT WE AS A STATE

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:46.721
ARE PROVIDING RESOURCES TO ALL

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:47.455
COMMUNITIES AND TO ALL

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:48.757
DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSEHOLDS

01:23:48.823 --> 01:23:54.295
AS WELL. ANDREW MENTIONED SOME

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:55.430
CHANGES, SOME PRETTY CRITICAL

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:56.865
CHANGES THAT HAPPEN AT THE

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:59.267
FEDERAL LEVEL. HE WAS REFERRING

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.102
TO THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL THAT

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:04.439
PASSED IN JULY. ONE OF THE

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.274
OUTCOMES OF THAT BILL WAS THIS

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:09.043
INCREASE OF 12% TO OUR 9% TAX

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.146
CREDIT PROGRAM THAT WILL START

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:13.448
AS OF JANUARY 1ST OF 2026. AND

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:15.350
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:17.285
WE'VE BEEN IN THE AFFORDABLE

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:18.686
HOUSING SPACE HAVE BEEN

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:19.287
ADVOCATING FOR FOR MANY YEARS

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:22.857
IS A REDUCTION OF THIS 50% TEST.

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:24.159
SO ANDREW MENTIONED AND I

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:26.594
MENTIONED THAT IN ORDER TO

01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:27.562
ACCESS THESE 4% TAX CREDITS, A

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:29.697
CERTAIN PERCENT OF THE PROJECT

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:31.433
HAS TO BE FINANCED USING TAX

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:34.803
EXEMPT BONDS. THAT IS PART OF

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.871
THE AUTHORITY. THESE, GENERALLY

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.239
SPEAKING, AS ALSO ANDREW

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:41.042
ILLUSTRATED IN HIS IN THE IN

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:43.211
HIS PRESENTATION, MOST

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:44.813
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS

01:24:44.879 --> 01:24:46.114
CAN'T SUPPORT A SIGNIFICANT

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:48.383
AMOUNT OF PRIVATE DEBT. AND SO

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.251
WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:52.353
DESIGNED, I THINK THE FEDERAL

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.355
GOVERNMENT IMAGINED THAT 50% OF

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:55.256
A PROJECT WOULD BE FINANCED

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:57.358
USING PRIVATE DEBT, AND THE

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:59.427
TAXES AND BONDS WAS A WAY TO

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:00.662
HAVE A LOWER INTEREST RATE FOR

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.530
THAT PRIVATE DEBT. WHAT WE'VE

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:04.232
LEARNED OVER TIME IS REALLY

01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:06.334
THAT IS NOT HOW MUCH OF A

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:08.102
PROJECT IS SUPPORTED WITH

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:09.337
PRIVATE DEBT AND WHAT WE WERE

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:11.473
USING. WE ENDED UP USING A LOT

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:13.308
OF OUR PRIVATE ACTIVITY BOND

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:15.443
VOLUME CAP THAT THEN WOULD

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:17.278
ACCESS THE 4% CREDITS AND THEN

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:19.247
WOULD GET PAID OFF ONCE A

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:20.515
PROJECT WAS CONVERTED. ONCE IT

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:23.184
WAS, THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:24.486
AND SO BY THE FEDERAL

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:27.489
GOVERNMENT IN THE BILL IN JULY,

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:28.389
LOWERED THAT THRESHOLD SO THAT

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:30.458
IN ORDER TO ACCESS 4% TAX

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:32.727
CREDITS, A PROJECT ONLY NEEDS

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.864
TO FINANCE AT LEAST 25% OF THE

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:38.666
COSTS. USING THESE TAX EXEMPT

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.168
PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS. AS A

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:42.737
RESULT, WE WILL NOW BE ABLE TO

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.173
FINANCE UP TO TWICE, PROBABLY

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.474
NOT QUITE TWICE, BUT ALMOST

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:48.610
TWICE AS MUCH AFFORDABLE

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:52.380
HOUSING ON THE 4% PROGRAM AS WE

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:55.216
HAVE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. OUR

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:56.818
COMMITTEE WORKED VERY QUICKLY

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:59.354
AND PASSED REGULATIONS ON

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.689
AUGUST 5TH TO IMPLEMENT THESE

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:03.224
JULY 4TH CHANGES THAT WILL HAVE

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:05.460
AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT FOR OUR

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:09.330
THIRD ROUND OF BOND OF 4% TAX

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:12.534
CREDIT PROJECTS. SO WE AT TCAC,

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.435
WE RUN THREE ROUNDS OF 4% AND

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:17.205
TWO ROUNDS OF 9% EVERY YEAR.

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:19.407
AND TO ILLUSTRATE THIS A LITTLE

01:26:19.474 --> 01:26:20.341
BIT, YOU KNOW, IN OUR SECOND

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:23.311
ROUND THIS YEAR, WE AWARDED 50

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:24.245
PROJECTS, 4% TAX CREDITS AND

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:27.282
BONDS. IN ROUND THREE, WE

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:28.516
EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.251
DO AT LEAST DOUBLE THAT, AND

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:32.287
WHICH WILL ALSO REALLY HELP

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:33.454
WITH OUR OVERSUBSCRIPTION RATE

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:35.323
AND BRING DOWN THAT THREE OR 4

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:39.093
TO 1 CLOSER TO HOPEFULLY 2 TO 1.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.728
AGAIN. THE BIGGER CHALLENGE

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:43.131
THEN BECOMES CAN WE WILL THERE

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:45.199
BE ENOUGH PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.401
FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE TO TAKE

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:47.201
ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THOSE

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:49.804
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES,

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:50.438
WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BE PART

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:52.340
OF? I THINK THE CONVERSATION AS

01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:54.576
WE MOVE THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.678
OF YEARS TO SORT OF SEE ONCE

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:58.780
SORT OF WE KIND OF RELEASE THE

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.715
DEMAND FROM THE EXISTING

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.116
PIPELINE, WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:04.552
FUTURE OUT YEARS. AND AGAIN,

01:27:04.619 --> 01:27:06.721
JUST A BIT OF ILLUSTRATION IN

01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:08.790
NUMBERS. YOU KNOW, WE ON THE 4%

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:12.627
PROGRAM, WE GENERALLY FINANCE

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:16.831
BETWEEN AROUND 15,000 ISH UNITS

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.266
A YEAR. SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:22.604
WE DO ABOUT 3000 ON THE 9% SIDE.

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:25.473
SO IN 2024 WE FINANCED A TOTAL

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:29.243
OF 18,235 UNITS. AND SO YOU CAN

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:32.013
IMAGINE WITH THE 25% TEST. NOW

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.450
THIS COULD BE AS MUCH AS 30,000

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:38.152
UNITS A YEAR INSTEAD OF 18. SO

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:40.054
A REALLY BIG CHANGE FOR

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:44.659
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S SORT OF IT

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:46.594
FOR ME, BUT HAPPY WHEN WE WHEN

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.363
EVERYONE FINISHES TO ANSWER

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.131
MORE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:52.166
MUCH. APPRECIATE IT. GOOD

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.568
AFTERNOON, CO-CHAIRS AND

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:55.069
MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR INVITING

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:56.704
ME TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:58.339
REBECCA FRANKLIN. I AM THE

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:59.407
CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:00.108
CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:02.276
AGENCY, ALSO KNOWN AS CALHFA, A

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:04.078
NAME YOU'VE HEARD A FEW TIMES

01:28:04.145 --> 01:28:05.480
THIS AFTERNOON AT THE HIGHEST

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:07.115
LEVEL, THE OVERVIEW OF CALHFA

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:10.284
IS CALHFA IS CALIFORNIA'S STATE

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:12.487
HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, WHICH

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:15.323
WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1975 TO

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:16.391
PROVIDE INNOVATIVE AND

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:18.159
EFFECTIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS TO

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:19.894
HELP IN ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:22.196
HOUSING NEEDS. CALHFA DOES NOT

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:24.465
BUILD HOUSING DIRECTLY. INSTEAD,

01:28:24.532 --> 01:28:26.067
WE PROVIDE FINANCIAL TOOLS IN

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:28.636
THE FORMS OF LOANS, GRANTS, AND

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:29.737
OTHER ASSISTANCE THAT MAKE

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.406
HOUSING PRODUCTION AND

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:33.241
HOMEOWNERSHIP POSSIBLE. AS

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:35.243
CALHFA HAS A BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:37.679
AND WHILE WE OFTEN ADMINISTER

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:38.846
STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDS, OUR

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:40.248
OPERATING COSTS ARE COMPLETELY

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:41.716
SELF-SUPPORTED THROUGH OUR

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:43.451
LENDING ACTIVITIES. THIS DOES

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:44.952
SET US APART FROM OUR OTHER

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:46.387
SISTER AGENCIES. I MENTIONED

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:47.989
THIS UNIQUE GOVERNANCE

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:49.057
STRUCTURE BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:51.292
COMBINE THAT WITH OUR STRONG

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:52.427
CREDIT RATING, ONE THAT WAS

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:54.328
JUST UPGRADED BY S&amp;P LAST WEEK,

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:57.365
WE'RE VERY PROUD. DOUBLE A+.

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.885
COMMITTEE IS EXACTLY RIGHT. IN

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:26.587
MY OPINION, IT'S HOUSING

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:27.321
FINANCE AND AFFORDABILITY. THIS

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:29.390
IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:30.324
ON RIGHT NOW. AND I'M HAPPY

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:31.926
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:33.027
THIS FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE IN

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:35.196
THE STATE. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO

01:35:35.262 --> 01:35:36.564
TALK ABOUT A FEW THINGS THAT

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:38.232
ARE WORKING AND A FEW THINGS

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:39.733
THAT ARE NOT WORKING, WHICH

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.635
I'LL RECHARACTERIZE AS

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:42.236
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE.

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.371
BUT I WANT TO START WITH THE

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:45.606
THINGS THAT ARE WORKING. AND

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:47.074
THERE'S THERE'S QUITE A LIST.

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:48.409
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:50.411
REALLY ARE WORKING AND A LOT OF

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:51.812
REALLY VERY SERIOUS

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:52.580
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE ARE VERY

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:54.081
APPRECIATIVE OF, STARTING WITH

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:55.349
LAND AVAILABILITY, THE HOUSING

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:57.218
ELEMENT, THE ARENA PROCESS, THE

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:59.353
AMENDMENTS TO THE SURPLUS LAND

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.288
ACT, THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:03.357
ORDER FOR THE EXCESS SITES

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:04.525
PROGRAM. ALL OF THESE ARE

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:06.127
HAVING THE EFFECT OF MAKING

01:36:06.193 --> 01:36:07.228
MORE LAND AVAILABLE AND

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:08.829
ACCESSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:10.097
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN AREAS

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:12.600
LIKE THE BAY AREA, WHERE LAND

01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:13.601
IS VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE. IT'S

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:16.270
VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE ACCESS TO

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:18.405
SITES THROUGH LOW COST, LONG

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:19.240
TERM LAND LEASES. SO THAT'S

01:36:19.306 --> 01:36:21.308
THAT'S DEFINITELY WORKING, OF

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:23.744
COURSE. AND YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:25.146
THIS TODAY AND CERTAINLY BEFORE

01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:27.348
THE SERIES OF LAND USE REFORMS,

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:29.483
INCLUDING DENSITY BONUS AND

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:30.317
STREAMLINING LAWS, HAVE

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.486
COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY WE

01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:34.288
PROCEED WITH ENTITLEMENTS AND

01:36:34.355 --> 01:36:36.323
CEQA CLEARANCE IN AFFORDABLE

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:38.159
HOUSING HERE IN THE STATE. I

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:40.327
HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE TIME IN

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:41.162
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY, AND I

01:36:41.228 --> 01:36:42.596
WOULD LIKE TO CALL IT

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:44.465
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. YOU KNOW,

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:46.333
IN THE PAST WHERE WE SPENT

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.702
YEARS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:50.237
TO DEFEND, TO PROCESS, TO FIGHT

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:52.306
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I HAVE

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:54.808
BEEN IN MANY OF THESE BATTLES,

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:55.442
TOO MANY OF THESE BATTLES. AND

01:36:55.509 --> 01:36:58.345
IT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOW.

01:36:58.412 --> 01:37:00.147
NOW WE'LL LOOK AT A SITE AND WE

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:01.415
LOOK AT THE MENU OF LAWS, AND

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.851
WE PICK THE LAW THAT WORKS BEST

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:05.186
FOR THAT SITE AND WE PROCEED.

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:07.288
SO IT REALLY IS AMAZING. I

01:37:07.354 --> 01:37:08.455
THINK I'VE SHARED IN THE PAST

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:10.224
THAT OUR ORGANIZATION HAS

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:13.027
STREAMLINED AND TITLED ABOUT

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:14.228
2000 OR MORE THAN 2000 UNITS

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:16.230
USING THESE STREAMLINING LAWS.

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:17.565
AND SINCE THEY'VE COME INTO

01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:19.533
EFFECT, SOME OF THESE ARE

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.267
ACTUALLY BUILT AND OCCUPIED.

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:22.036
AND I PROMISE YOU, WE WOULD

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:23.337
HAVE BEEN PROCESSING THEM UNDER

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:25.739
THE OLD SYSTEM. SO THAT IS

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:26.307
ABSOLUTELY WORKING. ANOTHER

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:27.274
THING THAT I'D LIKE TO

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:29.243
HIGHLIGHT THAT'S WORKING IS

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:30.444
HCD'S ACCOUNTABILITY UNIT.

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:33.180
THEIR WORK ENFORCING LAWS,

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:34.381
PARTICULARLY THE HOUSING

01:37:34.448 --> 01:37:36.217
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, HAS HAD A

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:38.719
VERY POSITIVE EFFECT. THEIR

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.054
WORK IMPACTS NOT ONLY THE

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.622
PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:43.657
DISCUSSED, BUT ALSO SENDS A

01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:44.525
CLEAR MESSAGE TO OTHER CITIES

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:47.361
THAT THE STATE IS SERIOUS ABOUT

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:48.495
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY AND WILL

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:50.864
ENFORCE ITS LAWS. SO WE

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:52.032
APPRECIATE THAT. I'D ALSO LIKE

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:53.334
TO HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING THAT I

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.336
THINK IS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE,

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:57.104
AND THAT IS THE TAX CREDIT

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:59.139
ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND THE

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:00.207
CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:02.076
ALLOCATION COMMITTEE, TCAC AND

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:03.210
CDLAC. THE TRANSPARENCY,

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:04.311
PREDICTABILITY, THE STRUCTURE

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:06.113
OF THESE COMMITTEES, COMBINED

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.181
WITH THE STAFF UNDER THE

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:09.216
EXCELLENT DIRECTION OF MARINA

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.384
WYANT. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE'S

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:11.652
GOING TO BE SITTING RIGHT NEXT

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.822
TO ME IS A MODEL OF EFFICIENT

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:17.224
AND EFFECTIVE RESOURCE

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:19.660
ALLOCATION FOR THE STATE OF

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:20.527
CALIFORNIA. IT'S A MODEL

01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:22.229
ACTUALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:25.065
WELL AS PRACTITIONERS. IT IS SO

01:38:25.132 --> 01:38:27.534
HELPFUL TO HAVE A KNOWN AND

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.637
CLEAR PROCESS WITH CURRENT

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:31.405
UPDATED REGULATIONS, FREQUENT

01:38:31.472 --> 01:38:33.407
APPLICATION ROUNDS, VERY QUICK

01:38:33.474 --> 01:38:36.277
AWARDS. AND MARINA TALKED A

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:37.544
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RECENT

01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:39.246
FEDERAL LAW THAT PASSED. AND I

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:41.282
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:43.183
WHAT HAPPENED THERE WITH THESE

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:45.386
RECENT CHANGES. JUST LAST MONTH,

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:49.390
JUST JULY, THE TCAC COMMITTEE

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:51.358
AND THAT COMMITTEE ACTED VERY,

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:52.259
VERY QUICKLY AND VERY SHORT

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:54.828
TIME EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WERE

01:38:54.895 --> 01:38:56.664
DRAFTED. THEY WERE RELEASED,

01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:58.432
COMMENTS WERE ACCEPTED, THEY

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:01.135
WERE REWRITTEN, THEY WERE PUT

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:03.837
INTO EFFECT. AND IT'S NOW

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:05.773
PROVIDING A PATH TO PRESERVE A

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:07.207
VERY VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:09.343
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE.

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:11.178
WE ARE WORK IN OTHER STATES,

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:12.279
AND OTHER STATES ARE STILL

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:13.414
GETTING THEIR ARMS AND THEIR

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.149
HEADS AROUND THIS NEW LAW. AND

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:17.051
HERE IN CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE OF

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.485
THIS ACTION, WE'RE ALREADY

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:19.586
PREPARING TO MAKE THESE

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:21.155
RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:22.489
PRODUCTION. SO THIS REALLY IS

01:39:22.556 --> 01:39:26.327
TO BE COMMENDED. ALL OF THESE

01:39:26.393 --> 01:39:28.462
IMPORTANT ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:30.331
IN SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OF TIME

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:32.666
AND MONEY INFUSED CRITICAL

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:34.234
CERTAINTY TO THE PROCESS, WHICH

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:36.370
I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH, AND

01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:38.238
IT DOES ENABLE US TO BRING MORE

01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:39.373
PROJECTS FORWARD FOR

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.574
DEVELOPMENT. AND SO I'M GOING

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:42.076
TO HIGHLIGHT ONE MORE THING,

01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:43.777
AND THEN I'M GOING TO MOVE ON

01:39:43.844 --> 01:39:45.813
TO OUR OPPORTUNITY AREAS. AND I

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:47.281
WILL SAY THIS, DESPITE THE FACT

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:49.316
THAT WE STILL HAVE CHALLENGES,

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:51.318
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:52.486
INROADS AND ACTUALLY DELIVER

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:54.455
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THOSE WHO

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:56.657
NEED IT. AND THIS IS WORKING,

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:59.059
AND I WILL SAY IT'S EXTREMELY

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:01.829
MEANINGFUL. AND I'M SURE YOU

01:40:01.895 --> 01:40:03.030
ALL KNOW THIS, BUT IF YOU'RE

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:05.132
INTERESTED, WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:06.467
HAVE YOU COME AND VISIT ANY OF

01:40:06.533 --> 01:40:08.168
OUR PROPERTIES. AND I'M SURE

01:40:08.235 --> 01:40:10.204
OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SPACE ARE

01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:11.538
VERY HAPPY TO HOST YOU AS WELL,

01:40:11.605 --> 01:40:13.240
SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:15.242
THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:16.410
HAVING ON THE INDIVIDUALS AND

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:18.412
FAMILIES THAT LIVE THERE. AND

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:19.346
I'LL JUST SHARE A COUPLE OF

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:21.048
STORIES. WE RECENTLY OPENED A

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:22.282
DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH BAY,

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:24.351
AND A RESIDENT SHARED WITH ME

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:26.387
THAT SHE HAD FACED A NUMBER OF

01:40:26.453 --> 01:40:26.854
CHALLENGES, INCLUDING

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.690
HOMELESSNESS, UNTIL SHE AND HER

01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:31.425
TWO CHILDREN, ONE OF WHOM HAS

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:33.560
SPECIAL NEEDS, WAS ABLE TO

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:35.529
SECURE AN APARTMENT IN OUR

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:39.333
DEVELOPMENT AND SHE TOURED US

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.635
AROUND IN HER APARTMENT AND IT

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:43.270
WAS FILLED WITH FAMILY PHOTOS

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:45.072
AND CHILDREN'S ART. AND SHE

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:48.342
SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS HAS REALLY

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:49.309
TURNED MY LIFE AROUND. IT HAS

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:51.278
REALLY MADE A SIGNIFICANT

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:52.446
DIFFERENCE. I'M GOING TO SHARE

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:54.615
ANOTHER STORY, AND THIS IS AN

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:58.018
OLDER STORY, BUT THIS IS ONE

01:40:58.085 --> 01:41:00.721
FOR A WOMAN WHO MOVED INTO

01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:03.090
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SAN

01:41:03.157 --> 01:41:04.491
FRANCISCO IN THE FIRST GRADE,

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.827
SHE AND HER FAMILY HAD BEEN

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:08.295
LIVING IN SROS. THEY WERE TOO

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:11.298
SMALL, UNHEALTHY, UNSAFE, AND

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:13.233
THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCESS

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.735
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SHE

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:16.236
TALKS ABOUT HAVING A ROOM AND

01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:18.305
MORE IMPORTANTLY, HAVING A DESK

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:19.973
WHERE SHE STUDIED THROUGH

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.208
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THROUGH HIGH

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:23.310
SCHOOL. SHE WAS ACCEPTED AND

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:24.945
GRADUATED FROM STANFORD. SHE

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:27.581
HAS A GREAT JOB, AND THE THING

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:30.150
THAT SHE HAS AND OUR OTHER

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:32.252
RESIDENT AND SO MANY OTHER

01:41:32.319 --> 01:41:34.154
RESIDENTS IS THAT THEY ARE NOW

01:41:34.221 --> 01:41:36.223
IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THRIVING.

01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:38.225
AND WITH EACH NEW UNIT, WE HAVE

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:40.527
THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE A

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:41.495
LIFE AND IT'S REALLY MEANINGFUL

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:43.130
AND THAT'S THIS IS WORKING. SO

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:44.465
I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:41:44.531 --> 01:41:48.068
FOR YOU. BUT I WILL SAY,

01:41:48.135 --> 01:41:49.269
UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN THOUGH IT

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:51.038
IS WORKING, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:53.207
IT'S NOT ENOUGH. AND NO MATTER

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:54.374
WHAT MEASURE YOU LOOK AT,

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:57.311
WHETHER IT'S RENT BURDEN OR

01:41:57.377 --> 01:42:00.447
HOMELESS COUNTS IN THE STATE OF

01:42:00.514 --> 01:42:00.981
CALIFORNIA, WE'RE FALLING

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:02.382
FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND EACH

01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:04.384
AND EVERY YEAR. WE ARE NOT

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:05.252
PRODUCING THE NUMBER OF HOUSING

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:07.287
UNITS THAT ARE NEEDED TO

01:42:07.354 --> 01:42:09.356
ADDRESS THE NEED IN THE STATE,

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:11.191
AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. THE

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:13.293
REASON IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.428
PROVIDING ENOUGH FUNDING FOR

01:42:14.495 --> 01:42:15.295
THE PRODUCTION OF THAT HOUSING

01:42:15.362 --> 01:42:18.432
IN THE STATE. WE JUST WE NEED

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:19.299
MORE FUNDING. WE NEED MORE

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:21.235
FUNDING. AND SOME OF WHAT

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:22.436
MARINA WAS ILLUSTRATING, WHERE

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.137
WE HAVE ACTUALLY EVEN MORE TAX

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:26.240
EXEMPT BONDS AND ACCESS TO EVEN

01:42:26.306 --> 01:42:28.308
MORE CREDITS, JUST EMPHASIZES

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:30.911
THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING MORE

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:32.246
FUNDING. WE SEE THIS PLAINLY IN

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:34.481
THE COMPETITIONS FOR STATE

01:42:34.548 --> 01:42:36.183
FUNDING RESOURCES. SOME OF THEM

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:39.319
ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED 4 TO 1, 5 TO

01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:41.355
1. IN THE CASE OF THE MHP

01:42:41.421 --> 01:42:43.257
PROGRAM, IT'S OVERSUBSCRIBED 11

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:45.025
TO 1. WHAT THAT MEANS THAT FOR

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:46.326
EVERY ONE PROJECT THAT GOES

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:49.463
THROUGH THREE OR 4 OR 10 OTHERS

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:51.632
ARE STUCK AND THEY HAVE TO

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:53.300
REAPPLY AND THEY'RE WAITING TO

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:54.234
MOVE FORWARD. WE COULD BUILD

01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:56.169
THAT HOUSING RIGHT NOW IF WE

01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:57.571
HAD THE MONEY, AND THAT'S WHY

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:59.706
I'M EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE

01:42:59.773 --> 01:43:01.441
OF FUNDING. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:03.277
US TO MOVE THOSE THOSE HOUSING

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:05.145
PROJECTS FORWARD BECAUSE THE

01:43:05.212 --> 01:43:06.880
INDIVIDUALS, THE FAMILIES AND

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:08.048
THE CHILDREN, LIKE THOSE THAT I

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:09.683
JUST MENTIONED, THEY'RE ALSO

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:11.418
STUCK WAITING FOR THEIR

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.387
OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:15.389
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I KNOW THAT

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:18.091
THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGING

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:20.661
ASPECTS TO OUR HOUSING DELIVERY

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:22.062
SYSTEM. THE EXCELLENT

01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:24.231
PRESENTATION ILLUSTRATES HOW

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:26.433
COMPLICATED OUR SYSTEM IS, AND

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.168
I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE A

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:29.770
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD

01:43:29.836 --> 01:43:32.539
RATHER FIX THE PROGRAM THAN

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:33.273
FUND IT, AND I COMPLETELY

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.508
UNDERSTAND AND AGREE WITH THIS

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:36.310
SENTIMENT, EXCEPT THAT I THINK

01:43:36.376 --> 01:43:38.345
WE NEED TO DO BOTH. WE NEED TO

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:41.081
FIX IT, AND WE NEED TO FUND IT.

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:44.618
AND I KNOW THAT THE STRUCTURE

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:46.353
IS COMPLICATED, IN PARTICULAR

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.655
BECAUSE OF THE LOW INCOME

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:49.790
HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM, THE

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:51.158
LIGHT TECH PROGRAM, WHICH IS A

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:52.359
FEDERAL PROGRAM. IT'S CODIFIED

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:55.462
IN THE TAX CODE BY CONGRESS.

01:43:55.529 --> 01:43:57.230
IT'S NOT OURS TO FIX, BUT IT'S

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:59.066
SO COMPLICATED THAT SOMETIMES

01:43:59.132 --> 01:44:00.367
IT LEADS PEOPLE TO THINK THAT

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:02.369
WE SHOULD ABANDON IT, OR WE

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:03.570
SHOULD DEVELOP A NEW SYSTEM

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.138
AROUND IT OR ON THE SIDE. BUT

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:06.840
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU, THE

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:08.508
PROBLEM IS LOVE IT OR HATE IT,

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:10.243
THE LIGHT TECH SYSTEM IS THE

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:12.346
BABY, NOT THE BATHWATER. AND I

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:14.147
WOULD SAY THAT TO YOU BECAUSE

01:44:14.214 --> 01:44:18.151
TECH BRINGS IN 150,000 250,400.

01:44:18.218 --> 01:44:21.355
IN SAN FRANCISCO, 500,000 A

01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:23.657
UNIT. IT'S TOO MUCH MONEY TO

01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:26.426
NOT PAY ATTENTION TO. AND SO I

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:29.563
THINK THAT OUR JOB IS TO

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:32.099
DETERMINE HOW BEST TO USE THIS

01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:34.267
RESOURCE FOR CALIFORNIANS. WE

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:35.202
NEED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:37.671
THE FUNDING THAT'S USED WITH

01:44:37.738 --> 01:44:39.339
TAX CREDITS, AND BE EFFICIENT

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:40.374
AND EFFECTIVE IN ADMINISTERING

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.376
THESE DOLLARS TO INCREASE THE

01:44:42.442 --> 01:44:44.511
SUPPLY OF NEW HOUSING IN THE

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:46.680
STATE. LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:47.447
THIS RECENT CHANGE AND BUILD

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:50.317
MORE HOUSING. SO I HAVE SOME

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:52.319
SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS. SOME OF

01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:53.754
THESE YOU'VE HEARD FROM ME

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.256
BEFORE, AND THIS IS IN THE AREA

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:57.257
OF FUNDING. ONE, THE HOUSING

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:59.259
BOND HOUSING BOND. I CAN'T

01:44:59.326 --> 01:45:00.494
EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.129
OF THE HOUSING BOND RIGHT NOW.

01:45:02.195 --> 01:45:04.231
THE HOUSING BOND IS CRITICAL

01:45:04.297 --> 01:45:05.332
FOR PROVIDING THE LEVEL OF

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:06.133
FUNDING THAT JUST ISN'T

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:08.201
POSSIBLE THROUGH THE BUDGET.

01:45:08.268 --> 01:45:10.570
AND I HOPE THAT THE ASSEMBLY

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:13.206
CAN LOCK ARMS WITH THE SENATE

01:45:13.273 --> 01:45:14.441
AND MOVE THIS FORWARD. WE IN

01:45:14.508 --> 01:45:15.642
THE HOUSING INDUSTRY, WE WILL

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:17.444
WORK ON IT. IT'S SO IMPORTANT

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:19.413
AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:20.714
OF THAT. MORE GENERAL FUND

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:22.282
MONEY. I RECOGNIZE WHAT I'M

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:23.517
SAYING BECAUSE I KNOW HOW

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:26.119
DIFFICULT THIS IS, BUT IT WAS

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:28.355
REALLY A DIFFICULT PROCESS. AND

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:30.223
I THINK SO MANY OF YOU WHO

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:32.325
FOUGHT THE FIGHT FOR HOUSING

01:45:32.392 --> 01:45:34.194
RESOURCES, BUT WHATEVER CAN BE

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:35.295
DONE TO INCREASE THOSE

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:37.397
RESOURCES IN FUTURE BUDGET

01:45:37.464 --> 01:45:39.232
ROUNDS, WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

01:45:39.299 --> 01:45:40.400
STATE CREDITS ARE FUNDED

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:42.135
THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND.

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:43.336
THEY'RE INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT.

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:45.505
WE COULD USE 3 OR 4 TIMES THE

01:45:45.572 --> 01:45:47.307
AMOUNT THAT WE HAVE. MGCP WAS

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:50.343
FUNDED THIS YEAR. WE COULD USE

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:51.745
TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT THAT WE

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:55.816
HAVE. PERM SOURCE. ONCE THE

01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:57.317
BONDS ARE PASSED, I HOPE THAT

01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:59.386
WE CAN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO A

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:00.287
PERMANENT SOURCE. I THINK IT'S

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:02.556
A GREAT FOCUS AREA FOR THIS

01:46:02.622 --> 01:46:03.390
COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE FIRMLY

01:46:03.457 --> 01:46:04.624
THAT A TRUE PERMANENT SOURCE

01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:06.226
COULD RADICALLY CHANGE THE WAY

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:07.360
HOUSING IS DELIVERED IN THE

01:46:07.427 --> 01:46:09.129
STATE, RATHER THAN THIS

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:10.097
UNPREDICTABLE AND PIECEMEAL

01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:11.298
APPROACH THAT WE'VE USED

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:13.100
HISTORICALLY. HAVING A ROBUST,

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:15.302
STEADY, ONGOING, STABLE SOURCE

01:46:15.368 --> 01:46:17.738
OF FUNDING FOR HOUSING COULD

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:19.072
INFUSE CERTAINTY AND

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.407
PREDICTABILITY TO THE PROCESS

01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:21.775
AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:23.110
EFFICIENCY. JUST HAVING THAT

01:46:23.176 --> 01:46:26.346
STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDS, WE

01:46:26.413 --> 01:46:29.249
COULD INCREASE SB TWO RECORDING

01:46:29.316 --> 01:46:31.418
FEES, TRANSFER TAX, HAVE A

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:32.152
DEDICATED SOURCE FROM THE

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:34.287
BUDGET. OTHER STATES DO THAT. I

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:36.156
THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THIS

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:38.225
COMMITTEE COULD TAKE THAT UP. I

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:39.860
ALSO SUGGEST THAT WE IMPLEMENT

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:41.261
A HOLISTIC AND THOUGHTFUL PLAN

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:43.663
TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. THIS

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.031
INCLUDES SHELTERS, TRANSITIONAL

01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:48.969
HOUSING, PERMANENT HOUSING TO

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:50.637
SUPPORT HOUSELESS INDIVIDUALS

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:53.573
AND FAMILIES. THIS WORK NEEDS

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.442
TO BE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:58.411
A CLEAR PLAN. IF WE'RE BUILDING

01:46:58.478 --> 01:46:59.179
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING,

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.547
TO HAVE A WAY TO SUPPORT THAT

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:02.482
HOUSING, NOT JUST AS IT'S BUILT,

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:04.317
BUT ONGOING AS WELL, I DON'T

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:06.386
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:08.822
CONTINUE PRIORITIZING,

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:11.491
PROVIDING A PREFERENCE FOR PSH

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:12.626
UNITS IF WE ARE GOING TO

01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:14.161
PRODUCE THOSE WITHOUT THE

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:15.829
ONGOING SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED

01:47:15.896 --> 01:47:18.131
FOR THE RESIDENTS AND FOR THEIR

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:21.067
OPERATIONAL HEALTH. AND THEN I

01:47:21.134 --> 01:47:22.335
WILL ALSO TWO MORE SECOND TO

01:47:22.402 --> 01:47:26.006
LAST, BRING BACK LOCAL FUNDING

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:27.240
LIKE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY FUNDS

01:47:27.307 --> 01:47:29.843
THAT WE HAD BEFORE. IT DON'T

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:30.644
MEAN NECESSARILY RESURRECTING

01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:32.245
THE OLD FORM OF REDEVELOPMENT,

01:47:32.312 --> 01:47:34.681
BUT IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL

01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:35.282
FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO EXPLORE

01:47:35.348 --> 01:47:37.250
HOW A SIMILAR MECHANISM COULD

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:39.219
BE DEVELOPED TO FUND AFFORDABLE

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:40.720
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. BEFORE

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:41.321
THE DISSOLUTION OF THE

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:44.124
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES, 20% OF

01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:46.226
THE TAX INCREMENT WAS MADE

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:48.995
AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:50.831
HOUSING, AND THIS GAVE LOCAL

01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:52.332
GOVERNMENTS INCREDIBLE

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:54.100
FLEXIBILITY AND AGENCY TO FUND

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:56.636
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, INCLUDING

01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:58.138
PREDEVELOPMENT ACQUISITION GAP

01:47:58.205 --> 01:47:59.506
FUNDING. THE GAP FUNDING THAT

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:01.041
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:03.310
NOW, YOU KNOW, IT WAS ABOUT A

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:05.512
MILLION, EXCUSE ME, $1 BILLION

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.714
A YEAR AWARDED AND THAT SOURCE

01:48:07.781 --> 01:48:09.416
OF FUNDS IS MISSING. IT HASN'T

01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:11.117
BEEN REPLACED. SO NO WONDER

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:12.285
WE'RE FALLING BEHIND. AND NO

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:14.087
WONDER WE'RE TAXING THESE STATE

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:16.389
RESOURCES THAT ARE NOW SO

01:48:16.456 --> 01:48:18.291
INCREDIBLY OVERSUBSCRIBED. THE

01:48:18.358 --> 01:48:21.561
LAST SUGGESTION IS TO

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:23.296
ADMINISTER OUR FUNDS MORE

01:48:23.363 --> 01:48:24.464
EFFICIENTLY. YOU'VE ALREADY

01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:26.299
BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE EFFORTS

01:48:26.366 --> 01:48:28.635
THAT ARE BEING MADE. I AM NOW

01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:31.238
GOING TO ADOPT ADOPT THE WORD

01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:33.506
CHORE AS WELL. OR THE NAME

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:34.341
CHORE. WE'RE ALREADY MAKING

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:35.375
PROGRESS WITH THE

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:37.210
REORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSING

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:39.613
AGENCIES INTO CHORE, BUT WE

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:43.183
ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS AND CHANGE

01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:45.318
THE WAY WE OPERATE WITHIN THE

01:48:45.385 --> 01:48:47.087
AGENCIES. I THINK IT'S GREAT TO

01:48:47.153 --> 01:48:48.221
CONSOLIDATE THE AGENCIES, BUT

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:50.557
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE

01:48:50.624 --> 01:48:51.591
AGENCIES ARE OPERATING OR

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:54.327
AGENCY. AND, YOU KNOW, THIS

01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:55.562
COMMITTEE MAY TAP INTO OR

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:57.364
EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE WORKING

01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:59.399
GROUP THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY

01:48:59.466 --> 01:49:01.301
AB 519 OR SET UP A SEPARATE

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:02.435
WORKING GROUP OF USERS WHO

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:04.371
COULD GIVE VERY CONCRETE

01:49:04.437 --> 01:49:06.339
SUGGESTIONS OF HOW TO

01:49:06.406 --> 01:49:07.374
ADMINISTER FUNDS MORE

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:09.075
EFFICIENTLY, OR WHERE THEY'RE

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:10.911
SEEING SOME OF THE

01:49:10.977 --> 01:49:12.746
INEFFICIENCIES THAT EXIST. I'D

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:15.548
LIKE TO JUST EMPHASIZE, THOUGH,

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:17.317
ONE MORE TIME, THAT BEING

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:19.052
EFFICIENT IS REALLY, REALLY

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:20.787
IMPORTANT, BUT IT DOESN'T

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:23.123
REPLACE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL

01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:24.824
FUNDING TO SOLVE OUR HOUSING

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:27.027
CRISIS. SO, SO MANY OF YOU HAVE

01:49:27.093 --> 01:49:29.195
MADE SUCH AN UNDENIABLE MARK IN

01:49:29.262 --> 01:49:30.330
ADDRESSING THE ONGOING CRISIS.

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.132
AND I REALLY THINK THAT THIS

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:33.300
COMMITTEE HAS SUCH GREAT

01:49:33.366 --> 01:49:34.401
PROMISE, AND I REALLY

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:35.568
APPRECIATE THE ENERGY AND THE

01:49:35.635 --> 01:49:36.736
LEADERSHIP THAT'S COMING WITH

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:39.272
THIS COMMITTEE. AND WE WANT TO

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:40.573
SUPPORT YOU WITH YOUR EFFORTS,

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.042
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:43.276
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:46.513
THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE.

01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:49.649
THIS IS A REALLY COMPLEX SPACE

01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:51.184
WEATHER. SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:52.552
THAT'S BEEN IN DIFFERENT SPACES

01:49:52.619 --> 01:49:54.487
FOR 30 YEARS, AND ALL OF YOU

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:56.289
HAVE OCCUPIED DIFFERENT SPACES,

01:49:56.356 --> 01:49:58.391
AND IT'S A MOVING TARGET. IT

01:49:58.458 --> 01:49:59.559
CHANGES, YOU KNOW, WITH THE

01:49:59.626 --> 01:50:02.362
ECONOMY, WITH THE MARKET. AND

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:05.365
SO THIS COMMITTEE, YOU KNOW, WE

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:07.367
ALL HAVE A PASSION AND A

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:08.535
COMMITMENT TO THIS. AND IT'S

01:50:08.601 --> 01:50:09.469
GOING TO BE AN EDUCATIONAL

01:50:09.536 --> 01:50:11.438
JOURNEY. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A

01:50:11.504 --> 01:50:13.073
PAINFUL ONE, BECAUSE WE'RE

01:50:13.139 --> 01:50:15.375
GOING TO HAVE TO GET IN SPACES

01:50:15.442 --> 01:50:17.544
THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH AND

01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:18.311
SPACES WE'RE NOT SO FAMILIAR

01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:20.413
WITH. BUT I THINK ALL OF MY

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.715
COLLEAGUES ARE COMMITTED TO

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:24.884
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS SPACE

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:26.152
THAT'S SUPER COMPLEX AND HAS

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:29.055
MANY MOVING TARGETS. BUT I

01:50:29.122 --> 01:50:31.491
WOULD LIKE TO JUST PAUSE HERE

01:50:31.558 --> 01:50:33.326
AND TURN IT BACK OVER TO MY

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:35.061
COLLEAGUES AND SEE IF THERE'S

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:36.696
ANY QUESTIONS. WE HAVE.

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:39.466
PANELISTS. YES. THANK YOU,

01:50:39.532 --> 01:50:41.234
MADAM CHAIR. FIRST, I WANT TO

01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:42.202
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME ON TO

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:44.671
THIS SELECT COMMITTEE. AS A

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:45.572
MEMBER OF THE RENTERS CAUCUS

01:50:45.638 --> 01:50:48.008
AND A MEMBER OF THE. I CAN'T

01:50:48.074 --> 01:50:49.175
BUY A HOUSE IN MY OWN DISTRICT

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:50.477
CAUCUS, I REALLY GREATLY

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:51.511
APPRECIATE A MORE IN-DEPTH LOOK

01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:53.413
ABOUT HOUSING FINANCE, BECAUSE

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:57.117
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WE, THE

01:50:57.183 --> 01:50:58.184
PAST COUPLE OF YEARS, HAVE

01:50:58.251 --> 01:51:00.387
REALLY ENTERED INTO THE MODERN

01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:02.055
REFORM ERA WHERE WE HAVE

01:51:02.122 --> 01:51:03.256
LOWERED THE BARRIERS AGAINST

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:04.591
NIMBYISM, AGAINST RESTRICTIONS

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:06.026
ON ZONING AND BUILDING AND

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.260
HOUSING, AND THAT IS VERY

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:09.362
IMPORTANT. BUT THE MODERN

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:11.731
BOTTLENECK WE SEE WITH THE

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:13.433
FINANCE, FINANCE RATES AND

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.601
INTEREST RATES AND EVERYTHING

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:16.136
IN THE RECENT TIME, THE REAL

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:17.303
BOTTLENECK NOW IS THE MONEY

01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:18.571
ASPECT. AND I THINK THE REAL

01:51:18.638 --> 01:51:20.240
QUESTION IN A TIME OF SCARCITY

01:51:20.306 --> 01:51:22.142
FOR US IN THE STATE BUDGET IS

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:23.410
HOW DO WE EFFICIENTLY EMPLOY

01:51:23.476 --> 01:51:24.944
OUR DOLLARS TO MAXIMIZE THE

01:51:25.011 --> 01:51:26.246
AMOUNT OF UNITS WE HAVE? AND I

01:51:26.312 --> 01:51:27.514
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,

01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.049
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE, AS MANY

01:51:29.115 --> 01:51:30.150
OF OUR SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT

01:51:30.216 --> 01:51:31.418
TODAY IS WE NEED TO MAKE IT

01:51:31.484 --> 01:51:33.219
MORE EFFICIENT, BUT ALSO

01:51:33.286 --> 01:51:34.087
SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS, MAKING

01:51:34.154 --> 01:51:36.256
OUR DEVELOPERS OF ALL SORTS GO

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:37.490
THROUGH 15 DIFFERENT GAMES AND

01:51:37.557 --> 01:51:40.293
CRITERIA ADDS TO THE COST. AND

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.861
SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG

01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:42.595
ADVOCATE OF SIMPLIFYING

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:44.264
UNIFYING THE COSTS AS MUCH AS

01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:45.498
POSSIBLE. SO I HAVE SOME

01:51:45.565 --> 01:51:48.268
QUESTIONS FOR OUR PANELISTS

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:50.437
HERE TODAY. AND SO I'LL TRY TO

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:51.304
ANSWER THEM REAL QUICKLY SO

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:53.506
THAT OTHER MEMBERS CAN ASK. BUT

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:54.574
I DO HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS.

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:56.576
SO I JUST WANT TO ASK. AND

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:58.311
MAYBE THIS IS MORE APPROPRIATE

01:51:58.378 --> 01:51:59.546
FOR OUR DEPUTY SECRETARY OF

01:51:59.612 --> 01:52:00.747
HOUSING FINANCE OR WHOEVER

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:03.349
WANTS TO TAKE THIS ONE. BUT.

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:05.185
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO JUST ASK IS

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:07.720
IN. SO LET'S JUST SAY OUR

01:52:07.787 --> 01:52:09.055
MODERN ERA OF REFORM, 2017,

01:52:09.122 --> 01:52:10.356
2016, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO PUT

01:52:10.423 --> 01:52:12.759
IT. YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN A

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:14.260
GOAL OUT THERE FROM THE

01:52:14.327 --> 01:52:14.828
GOVERNOR AND MANY ADVOCATES

01:52:14.894 --> 01:52:15.462
ABOUT BUILDING A MILLION

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:16.563
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR HOUSING

01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:18.231
OR HOMES FOR LOW INCOME

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:20.433
INDIVIDUALS. HOW FAR ALONG ARE

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.535
WE NOW IN 2025? HOW MANY UNITS

01:52:22.602 --> 01:52:24.304
HAVE WE BUILT? AND THEN

01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:26.406
SECONDLY, IF WE'RE TO GET TO

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:28.241
THAT GOAL IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM

01:52:28.308 --> 01:52:30.577
WE HAVE, HOW MUCH MORE MONEY DO

01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:31.778
WE NEED TO INJECT INTO THE

01:52:31.845 --> 01:52:34.547
SYSTEM TO EVEN GET TO THAT GOAL?

01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:37.250
WHAT IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION,

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:39.419
AND I WISH HCD WAS HERE TO

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:43.623
SHARE GREAT STATS WITH YOU. I

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:47.193
DO BELIEVE THAT I SAW AN

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.395
ESTIMATE OF ABOUT 650,000

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:53.700
AFFORDABLE UNITS HAVE BEEN

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:55.535
INVESTED IN BY THE STATE, AND

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:57.470
YOU KNOW WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO

01:52:57.537 --> 01:52:59.272
DO THE REST AND THE FLAVOR OF

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:01.207
THOSE UNITS, RIGHT. AND THE

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:02.175
TYPE OF POLICY PRIORITIES WE'RE

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:04.177
TRYING TO HIT. I WOULD REALLY

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:06.312
LOVE TO BRING HCD INTO THIS TO

01:53:06.379 --> 01:53:08.214
TO SHARE GOOD INFORMATION WITH

01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:10.183
YOU ABOUT THAT, BUT THAT'S

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.451
SUPER IMPORTANT. THANK YOU.

01:53:11.518 --> 01:53:13.686
YEAH. AND I THINK IT IS. YEAH.

01:53:13.753 --> 01:53:14.454
THANKS FOR THAT. IT'S

01:53:14.521 --> 01:53:16.456
DEFINITELY A AS WE LOOK AT THE

01:53:16.523 --> 01:53:17.357
METRICS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK

01:53:17.423 --> 01:53:19.292
AT HOW FAR WE'VE GONE. I

01:53:19.359 --> 01:53:21.094
BELIEVE ONE OF OUR OUR OWN

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:22.428
MAJORITY ASSISTANT MAJORITY

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:24.497
LEADER ON RESEARCH POLICY AND

01:53:24.564 --> 01:53:25.598
RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTED THAT I

01:53:25.665 --> 01:53:27.200
THINK IN THE LAST RINA CYCLE,

01:53:27.267 --> 01:53:29.636
WE ONLY DID 500,000 OF ALL

01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:31.204
TYPES WHEN OUR GOAL WAS 1.2

01:53:31.271 --> 01:53:33.306
MILLION. SO WE'RE STILL BEHIND,

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:34.641
AS WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT. I

01:53:34.707 --> 01:53:35.375
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:37.710
COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT WHERE OUR

01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:38.912
METRICS ARE. AND THEN EVEN THE

01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:39.479
CURRENT SYSTEM, LET'S SAY,

01:53:39.546 --> 01:53:41.648
PRE-REFORM ALL THE GREAT THINGS

01:53:41.714 --> 01:53:43.049
THAT IS GOING TO DO IN UNIFYING.

01:53:43.116 --> 01:53:44.284
LET'S JUST PRETEND WE'RE IN THE

01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:45.418
CURRENT SYSTEM. HOW MUCH MONEY

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:47.520
DO WE HAVE TO INJECT IN IT? THE

01:53:47.587 --> 01:53:49.622
SECOND THING I WAS GOING TO ASK

01:53:49.689 --> 01:53:52.625
OF FOR CALHFA TOO, IS SO YOU

01:53:52.692 --> 01:53:54.227
WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:55.395
DOWN PAYMENT PROGRAMS. THERE'S

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:56.563
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS, OF COURSE,

01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:58.164
IN ADDITION TO DREAM FOR ALL.

01:53:58.231 --> 01:53:59.299
SO WE'VE INJECTED SEVERAL

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:00.466
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS, MAYBE

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:02.035
CLOSE TO A BILLION NOW OVER

01:54:02.101 --> 01:54:04.671
THIS MULTIPLE PHASES. THOSE ARE

01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:06.172
ALL LOAN REPAYMENTS. CORRECT.

01:54:06.239 --> 01:54:10.410
SO THAT THE, THE THE PERSON WHO

01:54:10.476 --> 01:54:12.078
GETS THE LOAN HAS TO PAY PAY

01:54:12.145 --> 01:54:14.480
BACK TO THE STATES THAT MONEY.

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:16.149
RIGHT. SO YEAH, FOR BOTH

01:54:16.216 --> 01:54:18.318
TECHNICALLY MY HOME AS WELL AS

01:54:18.384 --> 01:54:20.153
DREAM FOR ALL THEY WOULD BE

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.255
REPAID UPON THE HOUSE BEING

01:54:22.322 --> 01:54:25.258
SOLD OR TRANSFERRED UPON THE

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:27.227
TRANSFER OR SALE. OKAY. SO THEN

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:28.461
THAT MONEY ITSELF ISN'T EVEN

01:54:28.528 --> 01:54:30.563
THOUGH SAY WE SAY THREE PHASES,

01:54:30.630 --> 01:54:31.497
THAT MONEY IS BASICALLY LOCKED

01:54:31.564 --> 01:54:33.499
INTO THE EQUITY OF THE HOUSE

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:35.235
UNTIL THE SALE IS TO HAPPEN,

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:37.170
RIGHT? THE SALE OR A REFINANCE?

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:39.472
THERE'S A ONE TIME REFINANCE

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:40.473
FOR DREAM FOR ALL ONE TIME

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.609
REFINANCE. OKAY, I JUST WANT TO

01:54:42.675 --> 01:54:43.476
HIGHLIGHT FOR THAT PROGRAM, YOU

01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:45.411
KNOW, AS IT WAS IN THE PAST,

01:54:45.478 --> 01:54:47.013
SOME THINGS DISCUSSIONS WE'VE

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.548
HAD IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

01:54:48.615 --> 01:54:49.482
ABOUT WHO ARE THE RECIPIENTS

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:50.450
GETTING THOSE PROGRAMS, I DON'T

01:54:50.516 --> 01:54:52.185
KNOW IF YOU CAN SHARE ANY MORE

01:54:52.252 --> 01:54:53.786
OF THAT, BECAUSE IN THE PAST,

01:54:53.853 --> 01:54:54.687
WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED GEOGRAPHIC

01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:56.022
NON DIVERSITY AND DEMOGRAPHIC

01:54:56.089 --> 01:54:58.224
NON DIVERSITY TO IT. BUT CAN

01:54:58.291 --> 01:55:00.059
YOU SHARE ABOUT WHERE WE ARE

01:55:00.126 --> 01:55:01.361
NOW WITH DIFFERENT PHASES. WHAT

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:04.464
THAT DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE

01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:05.732
WHO'VE RECEIVED THIS LOOKS LIKE

01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:08.334
NOW. YEAH. SO IF WE COMBINE THE

01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:09.569
FIRST TWO PHASES FROM AN

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:10.303
OUTCOME PERSPECTIVE FOR DREAM

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:12.572
FOR ALL, THE PROGRAM ITSELF HAS

01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:15.174
HELPED OVER 4,001ST TIME

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.476
HOMEBUYERS REALLY REALIZE THE

01:55:16.542 --> 01:55:18.411
DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP ACROSS

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:20.179
OUR STATE, GEOGRAPHICALLY

01:55:20.246 --> 01:55:22.148
DISPERSED, AS WELL AS WE'RE

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:24.717
VERY PROUD OF 65% OF THOSE

01:55:24.784 --> 01:55:27.253
BUYERS. OF THAT 4000 IDENTIFIED

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.389
AS BELONGING TO A COMMUNITY OF

01:55:29.455 --> 01:55:32.525
COLOR. SO I THINK THAT THE

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:34.727
GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION BECAUSE

01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:36.062
IN PHASE TWO OF DREAM FOR ALL,

01:55:36.129 --> 01:55:38.164
THERE WAS GEOGRAPHIC SET ASIDES.

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:40.433
SO NOT ONLY HAVE WE REACHED

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:41.100
ACROSS THE STATE GEOGRAPHICALLY,

01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:44.337
BUT ALSO THAT 65% OF PEOPLE

01:55:44.404 --> 01:55:45.638
SELF-IDENTIFYING COMING FROM A

01:55:45.705 --> 01:55:47.307
COMMUNITY OF COLOR, WE'RE BOTH

01:55:47.373 --> 01:55:48.374
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:50.176
IMPACT WE'VE HAD. DEFINITELY AN

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:52.645
IMPROVEMENT FROM PHASE ONE. SO

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:53.646
I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR

01:55:53.713 --> 01:55:55.548
THE COMMITTEE IS THAT UNDER THE

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:56.449
CURRENT DREAM FOR ALL PROGRAM,

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:58.651
WHILE IT'S VERY GOOD AND WE

01:55:58.718 --> 01:55:59.419
HAVE TO, WE ARE LIMITED IN

01:55:59.485 --> 01:56:01.287
RESOURCES. IT IS LIMITED TO

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:03.356
PEOPLE WHO ARE FIRST GENERATION

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:04.290
HOMEBUYERS IN THE ENTIRE

01:56:04.357 --> 01:56:06.726
LINEAGE. SO IF YOU WERE TO HAVE

01:56:06.793 --> 01:56:08.461
A PARENT AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE

01:56:08.528 --> 01:56:09.329
NOT HOPING FOR THEM TO DIE AND

01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:11.464
THEN GET THEIR HOUSE, THEY ARE

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:12.665
NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THESE PROGRAMS

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:13.433
EVEN IF THEY'RE UNDER THE

01:56:13.499 --> 01:56:14.567
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. SO THAT

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.536
DOES LIMIT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:18.171
WANT TO GROW THEIR FAMILIES IN

01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:19.172
HERE. RIGHT? SO SOMETHING FOR

01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:21.107
US TO HIGHLIGHT AS WELL. AND

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:23.242
THEN I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT, AS

01:56:23.309 --> 01:56:24.644
IS COMBINING AND DOING THIS

01:56:24.711 --> 01:56:26.045
WORK, WHICH I UNDERSTAND, THE

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:27.680
REORG IS NOT GOING TO BE DONE

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:29.382
UNTIL ALMOST THE END OF 27 OR

01:56:29.449 --> 01:56:31.150
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, RIGHT? OR

01:56:31.217 --> 01:56:33.219
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IN THE

01:56:33.286 --> 01:56:34.787
NEAR TERM, ARE THERE STEPS YOU

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:36.356
CAN TAKE TO UNIFY AND SIMPLIFY

01:56:36.422 --> 01:56:39.158
THE PROCESS OF APPLICANTS RIGHT

01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:41.160
NOW? BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT

01:56:41.227 --> 01:56:42.495
YOU'RE STRIVING TO DO. BUT I

01:56:42.562 --> 01:56:43.629
JUST WONDERING, IN THE MEANTIME,

01:56:43.696 --> 01:56:45.231
IS THERE THINGS YOU COULD DO TO

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:47.633
GET US MORE, MORE FINANCING OUT

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:50.403
MORE QUICKLY? YOU KNOW, I THINK

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:51.838
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:53.339
QUESTION BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AS

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:54.741
WE'RE THINKING AND PLANNING OUT

01:56:54.807 --> 01:56:56.376
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REORG,

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:58.111
WE DON'T WANT TO EVER GET IN

01:56:58.177 --> 01:57:00.279
THE WAY OF THE FUNDING ROUNDS.

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:01.414
LIKE THAT'S NUMBER ONE, RIGHT?

01:57:01.481 --> 01:57:02.248
THAT'S BASELINE. BUT THEN ON

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:04.317
TOP OF THAT, WE ARE TALKING

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:05.485
ABOUT HOW DO WE TAKE THE

01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:07.120
LESSONS WE'RE LEARNING AND WHAT

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:08.287
WE'RE HEARING THROUGH THE 519

01:57:08.354 --> 01:57:10.056
WORK GROUPS AND OTHER

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.124
STAKEHOLDERS EXPAND OUR

01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:13.593
OUTREACH. SO WE ARE FEEDING IN

01:57:13.659 --> 01:57:16.062
TO THE PLANNING OF, YOU KNOW, I

01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:18.331
THINK THERE'S INTERIM STEPS

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:21.300
THAT WILL HAPPEN. I CAN'T SAY

01:57:21.367 --> 01:57:23.436
EXACTLY WHAT THOSE ARE, BUT WE

01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:24.370
ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:27.340
IT EASIER TO REAPPLY, YOU KNOW,

01:57:27.407 --> 01:57:29.041
FOR HCD FUNDING, LIKE HOW DO WE

01:57:29.108 --> 01:57:30.777
TAKE AWAY SOME OF THAT FRICTION

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:32.478
IN THE SYSTEM EVEN BEFORE WE

01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:34.180
HAVE THE PERFECT KIND OF ONE

01:57:34.247 --> 01:57:36.215
STOP SHOP SOLUTION, WHICH IS

01:57:36.282 --> 01:57:37.550
STILL THE GOAL, RIGHT? BUT WE

01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:39.552
ARE THINKING ABOUT THE STEPS

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:41.020
ALONG THAT PATH. OKAY. AND THIS

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:42.288
LAST COMMENT IS I APPRECIATE

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:43.389
CALHFA TALKING ABOUT THE

01:57:43.456 --> 01:57:45.358
PROGRAMS AND HOW SOME OF THESE

01:57:45.425 --> 01:57:46.993
ARE DIFFERENT EQUITY MODELS AND

01:57:47.059 --> 01:57:48.161
THE REPAYMENTS, BECAUSE I DO

01:57:48.227 --> 01:57:49.495
THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT

01:57:49.562 --> 01:57:51.030
INJECTING MORE MONEY INTO THE

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:53.166
HOUSING FINANCE WORLD, I DO

01:57:53.232 --> 01:57:54.267
THINK ESPECIALLY IN LIMITED

01:57:54.333 --> 01:57:55.601
TIME OF SCARCITY, OUR MODEL NOW

01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:58.204
IS TAX MONEY IN, TAX MONEY OUT.

01:57:58.271 --> 01:57:59.472
WE GIVE DEVELOPERS NONPROFITS

01:57:59.539 --> 01:58:01.140
IF THEY BE. AND THAT MONEY IS

01:58:01.207 --> 01:58:02.442
GONE. AND EVERY SINGLE YEAR,

01:58:02.508 --> 01:58:03.643
YOU KNOW OUR COLLEAGUES HERE,

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:05.244
WE HAVE TO FIGHT THE GOVERNOR

01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:06.312
ADMINISTRATION TO GET ALL THAT

01:58:06.379 --> 01:58:08.714
MONEY BACK. BUT I DO THINK IN A

01:58:08.781 --> 01:58:10.082
TIME ABOUT THINKING ABOUT

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:11.417
HOUSING FINANCE, WE SHOULD

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:13.052
THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE Ã A

01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:14.353
GOOD DEAL WITH THE TAXPAYERS

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.255
AND SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

01:58:16.322 --> 01:58:18.491
A BUNCH OF MONEY RIGHT NOW, PUT

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:19.258
IT IN SOMETHING LIKE A RECYCLED

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:21.427
REVOLVING LOAN FUND, GIVE IT

01:58:21.494 --> 01:58:22.195
BACK AND SIMPLIFY IT, BECAUSE

01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:24.197
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO

01:58:24.263 --> 01:58:25.465
WE HAVE A STABLE, PERMANENT

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:26.165
SOURCE OF FINANCING. SO I

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:27.333
APPRECIATE OUR SPEAKER TALKING

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:29.168
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I'M ALSO A

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:30.436
PROUD MEMBER OF THE TAX THE

01:58:30.503 --> 01:58:32.071
RICH CAUCUS. SO WE SHOULD ALSO

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:33.372
FIND WAYS TO DO THAT. AND I

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:35.041
APPRECIATE AGAIN ALL OUR

01:58:35.107 --> 01:58:36.275
PRESENTERS COME HERE. SO THANK

01:58:36.342 --> 01:58:37.310
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. ASSEMBLY

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:40.446
MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA. THANK YOU

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:43.149
TO THE CO-CHAIRS FOR BRINGING

01:58:43.216 --> 01:58:44.517
THIS FORWARD. THIS IS

01:58:44.584 --> 01:58:46.819
DEFINITELY A TOPIC THAT I

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:51.624
FOLLOW QUITE A BIT. I HAVE SOME

01:58:51.691 --> 01:58:53.493
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. SOME OF

01:58:53.559 --> 01:58:55.761
THEM YOU MAY LIKE, SOME OF THEM

01:58:55.828 --> 01:58:57.196
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE, AND

01:58:57.263 --> 01:58:58.865
I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:01.300
THAT BECAUSE THIS IS NOW 11

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:05.671
YEARS IN AND I'VE BEEN PART AS

01:59:05.738 --> 01:59:07.540
A PROFESSION IN TWO BIG SYSTEMS,

01:59:07.607 --> 01:59:10.209
ONE AS AN EDUCATOR FOR 30 YEARS.

01:59:10.276 --> 01:59:13.079
AND NOW THIS AS A SECOND

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:15.848
CHAPTER. AND NOW I'M ENTERING

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:18.117
MY LAST YEAR. AND SO THERE'S

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:20.119
GOOD NEWS AND THERE'S BAD NEWS.

01:59:20.186 --> 01:59:22.255
I'LL START WITH THE GOOD NEWS,

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:24.357
WHICH IS MY COLLEAGUES HERE, WE

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:26.092
HAVE ALL THESE YOUNG, FRESH

01:59:26.158 --> 01:59:28.427
FACE, FACES AND YOUNG BY AGE AS

01:59:28.494 --> 01:59:31.230
WELL. AND SO THEY HAVE A WHOLE

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:34.400
NOTHER DECADE TO EXPLORE AND TO

01:59:34.467 --> 01:59:36.569
ASK QUESTIONS AND TO PUSH THIS

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:38.471
FORWARD. AND WE HAVE MADE

01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:40.373
PROGRESS. SO I APPRECIATE THAT

01:59:40.439 --> 01:59:43.709
WE DON'T ALWAYS CELEBRATE THE

01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:46.646
WINS AND THERE HAS BEEN

01:59:46.712 --> 01:59:48.314
PROGRESS MADE, I THINK, THIS

01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:50.049
LAST FEW YEARS WITH, OF COURSE,

01:59:50.116 --> 01:59:51.851
THE SEQUA LEGISLATION, THE

01:59:51.918 --> 01:59:54.186
SURPLUS LAND, THERE HAVE BEEN

01:59:54.253 --> 01:59:58.157
UNITS BUILT AND SO THERE AND

01:59:58.224 --> 01:59:59.892
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T

01:59:59.959 --> 02:00:03.229
WANT TO CELEBRATE ANY PROGRESS.

02:00:03.296 --> 02:00:05.031
IT'S JUST IT'S COST A LOT OF

02:00:05.097 --> 02:00:07.400
MONEY. SO IT'S NOT. BUT WE KNOW

02:00:07.466 --> 02:00:08.301
LIVES ARE CHANGED WHEN THEY'RE

02:00:08.367 --> 02:00:10.736
ACTUALLY PEOPLE ARE HOUSED. THE

02:00:10.803 --> 02:00:11.370
INTERSECTION BETWEEN

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:13.239
HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING IS A

02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:16.042
REAL DATA POINT. AND THEY'RE

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:18.611
NOT SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS. AND

02:00:18.678 --> 02:00:20.179
THEY SHOULDN'T BE, BECAUSE WE

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:23.716
KNOW THAT WE ARE PUSHING PEOPLE

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:26.252
TO THE STREETS FASTER THAN WE

02:00:26.319 --> 02:00:29.088
ARE HOUSING THEM. AND SOME OF

02:00:29.155 --> 02:00:31.757
EVEN THIS YEAR'S BIG, BEAUTIFUL

02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:34.126
BILL REALLY TERRIFIES ME IN THE

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:36.662
SENSE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:00:36.729 --> 02:00:38.097
SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS, ALL OF

02:00:38.164 --> 02:00:40.232
THESE NEW THINGS THAT CAN ADD.

02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:42.168
SO THERE'S SOME REAL CONCERN

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:46.739
THERE. BUT MY BIGGEST I'M VERY

02:00:46.806 --> 02:00:49.442
PERPLEXED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE AS

02:00:49.508 --> 02:00:51.143
THE BUDGET CHAIR, SOME FIVE

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:53.145
WHERE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS,

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:55.781
WE VETTED THESE ISSUES AND ONE

02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:59.418
WHICH WAS NOW CHANGING HCD AND

02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:00.219
CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND MAKING

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:02.788
THEM A STANDALONE. IF YOU WERE

02:01:02.855 --> 02:01:04.357
FOLLOWING THAT, YOU'LL NOTE

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:08.728
THAT I WAS NOT COMPLETELY

02:01:08.794 --> 02:01:11.497
SUPPORTING THAT FOR A FEW

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:14.200
REASONS. ONE OF THE REASONS IS

02:01:14.266 --> 02:01:17.303
IT WAS NOT TOLD TO ME, AND I

02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:18.537
DON'T BELIEVE IT'S EVEN TRUE TO

02:01:18.604 --> 02:01:20.406
THIS DAY THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:22.642
TAKE AWAY A RESPONSIBILITY LIKE

02:01:22.708 --> 02:01:24.076
CONSUMER AFFAIRS, THAT NOW

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:25.411
WE'RE ONLY GOING TO FOCUS ON

02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:27.113
HOUSING AND EVERYTHING WILL BE

02:01:27.179 --> 02:01:29.348
STREAMLINED. WHAT WAS NOT SAID

02:01:29.415 --> 02:01:31.350
WAS THE BODIES ARE NOT ALL

02:01:31.417 --> 02:01:32.251
MOVING INTO THE SAME BUILDING.

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:34.186
AND MAYBE I'M OLD SCHOOL ON

02:01:34.253 --> 02:01:36.288
THIS, BUT IF YOU STILL HAVE

02:01:36.355 --> 02:01:38.124
PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT STATE

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:39.392
DEPARTMENT BUILDINGS, THEY'RE

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:41.060
STILL GOING TO BE DOING ZOOMS.

02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:42.962
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THIS

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:44.330
KIND OF DISCONNECTION. THERE

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:46.165
WAS ALSO NO METRICS PROVIDED TO

02:01:46.232 --> 02:01:48.267
US, AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING

02:01:48.334 --> 02:01:49.869
WHAT'S GOING TO BE FASTER. IT'S

02:01:49.935 --> 02:01:51.170
GOING TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT.

02:01:51.237 --> 02:01:52.805
IT'S GOING TO BE A ONE STOP

02:01:52.872 --> 02:01:54.740
SHOP. MY QUESTION IS, WHY

02:01:54.807 --> 02:01:56.575
HAVEN'T WE BEEN DOING THIS FOR

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:58.778
THE LAST DECADE? THIS WE DON'T

02:01:58.844 --> 02:02:00.379
NEED PERMISSION TO DO THIS. WE

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.314
DON'T NEED TO WAIT UNTIL YOU

02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:04.250
ALL MOVE IN. IF YOU'RE EVEN ARE

02:02:04.316 --> 02:02:07.386
GOING TO AND 2026 TO DO THIS.

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:10.723
LIKE THE CLOCK IS TICKING. THIS

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:12.825
ALL COULD BE HAPPENING NOW. AND

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:13.426
I BRING BACK EDUCATION BECAUSE

02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:15.861
WE GET NEW MANDATES EVERY YEAR

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.029
AS TEACHERS. NOW YOU'RE GOING

02:02:17.096 --> 02:02:18.230
TO DO WHOLE LANGUAGE. NOW

02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:19.532
YOU'RE GOING TO DO ONLY PHONICS.

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:21.400
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:22.334
MATH PROGRAM. AND WE CAN'T SAY,

02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:24.370
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO WAIT FOR A

02:02:24.437 --> 02:02:26.439
YEAR UNTIL WE'RE ALL ON THE

02:02:26.505 --> 02:02:29.241
SAME PAGE. SO MY MY PLEA TO YOU

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:32.211
AND TO TAKE BACK TO HCD AND,

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:34.380
AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN SAY TO

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:36.482
THE LEADERS THERE, THEY KNOW MY

02:02:36.549 --> 02:02:38.350
OPINION, WHICH IS WHETHER IT'S

02:02:38.417 --> 02:02:42.354
20, 26 NEXT JULY OR SIX MONTHS

02:02:42.421 --> 02:02:44.390
AFTER THAT, AFTER YOU MOVE IN,

02:02:44.457 --> 02:02:46.158
WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO WAIT.

02:02:46.225 --> 02:02:48.427
SO PLEASE START WORKING ON THE

02:02:48.494 --> 02:02:50.196
STREAMLINING. WE'VE HAD THE

02:02:50.262 --> 02:02:52.231
BILLS, WE'VE HAD THE

02:02:52.298 --> 02:02:54.166
LEGISLATION. DALY DID A BILL.

02:02:54.233 --> 02:02:56.268
IT'S LISTED IN HERE. THIS IS

02:02:56.335 --> 02:02:57.570
NOT NEW. WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR

02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:59.672
THIS ONE STOP SHOP FOR

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:01.307
DEVELOPERS PARTICULARLY, BUT

02:03:01.373 --> 02:03:03.576
MOST IMPORTANTLY, TO GET THE

02:03:03.642 --> 02:03:06.679
UNITS BUILT. SO, PLEASE,

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:09.381
WHATEVER YOU CAN DO TO EXPEDITE

02:03:09.448 --> 02:03:11.250
THIS STREAMLINING. THIS SEEMS

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:14.286
TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES.

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:16.255
AND THEN RELATED TO THE TAXES,

02:03:16.322 --> 02:03:19.391
I KNOW IT'S A WHOLE NOTHER ARM,

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:22.228
BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME

02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:23.996
COMMUNICATION TO MOVE THESE

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:26.332
THINGS. IF WE CAN SAY ANYTHING

02:03:26.398 --> 02:03:29.401
GOOD OF THE PANDEMIC IS, THERE

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:30.102
IS ZOOM OPPORTUNITY SO YOU

02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:32.271
DON'T HAVE TO WALK OVER. SO IN

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:33.205
SOME WAYS I'M KIND OF SAYING

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:36.408
TWO THINGS, BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE

02:03:36.475 --> 02:03:39.712
THESE. I HEAR NUMEROUS TIMES

02:03:39.779 --> 02:03:41.347
ABOUT APPLICATIONS AND CITIES

02:03:41.413 --> 02:03:43.115
WHO ARE WAITING TO HEAR. AND

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:45.251
SOMEBODY MAYBE THERE'S EVEN AN

02:03:45.317 --> 02:03:46.519
APPEAL AND THEY'RE WAITING FOR

02:03:46.585 --> 02:03:48.154
SOMEBODY TO GET BACK TO THEM.

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:51.757
SO PLEASE, ON THAT, ON THE NEXT

02:03:51.824 --> 02:03:52.591
PART THAT I'M VERY PERPLEXED

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.527
AGAIN, HAVING NUMEROUS HEARINGS

02:03:54.593 --> 02:03:56.662
ON THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET PART

02:03:56.729 --> 02:03:59.465
WAS HCD CAME TO US THIS BUDGET

02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:03.636
YEAR AND TOLD US THEY'RE GOOD

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:04.470
ON FUNDING. THERE'S SO MUCH

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:07.206
MONEY IN THE PIPELINE, SO MUCH

02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:08.841
MONEY THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:11.210
NEED TO ASK FOR ANY MORE MONEY.

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:12.545
AND BY THE WAY, THE GOVERNOR

02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:14.547
ZEROED OUT ALL THE DOLLARS. SO

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:18.450
FROM JANUARY UNTIL MAY, ALL THE

02:04:18.517 --> 02:04:20.686
LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS,

02:04:20.753 --> 02:04:22.555
THE MULTIFAMILY HOUSING THAT

02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:25.157
WAS ZEROED OUT, WE HAD TO FIGHT,

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:28.027
REALLY FIGHT, HAVE SOME

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:29.228
AGGRESSIVE CONVERSATIONS, AND

02:04:29.295 --> 02:04:31.497
WE ENDED UP GETTING CLOSE TO A

02:04:31.564 --> 02:04:33.365
BILLION AND A HALF. BUT THOSE

02:04:33.432 --> 02:04:35.267
TALKING POINTS ARE REALLY AN

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:38.304
IMPORTANT NOTE, WHICH IS WE ARE

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:41.073
NEVER GOOD WITH THE AMOUNT OF

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.741
MONEY WE NEED TO BUILD THIS

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:45.044
HOUSING. SO TO EVEN STATE THAT

02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:47.379
IN ANY WAY. BUT IT WAS STATED 2

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:49.548
OR 3 TIMES IN PUBLIC FORUMS ARE

02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:51.183
HEARINGS. THAT'S JUST NOT

02:04:51.250 --> 02:04:53.319
ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE WE KNOW IF

02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:54.854
THE MONEY IS GOING OUT, IT'S

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:56.222
GOING TO BE USED, AND THEN

02:04:56.288 --> 02:04:58.591
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2 OR

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.092
3 YEARS FROM NOW. SO PLEASE

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:02.795
HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. THAT WAS

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:04.430
NOT ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE WE HAD

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:06.432
TO FIGHT HARD WITH THE GOVERNOR

02:05:06.498 --> 02:05:08.167
AND HIS TEAM TO BRING THOSE

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:11.370
FUNDS BACK IN. ON THE POSITIVE

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:14.173
SIDE, I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.474
ABOUT THE LOW INCOME TAX

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:17.176
CREDITS. I MYSELF HAVE WORKED

02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:19.278
IN THAT SPACE WITH GETTING SOME

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:20.212
LEGISLATION RELATED TO

02:05:20.279 --> 02:05:22.047
FLEXIBILITY. WE KNOW THAT'S

02:05:22.114 --> 02:05:24.516
IMPORTANT. I APPRECIATE MY

02:05:24.583 --> 02:05:25.584
COLLEAGUE MENTIONING THE

02:05:25.651 --> 02:05:28.420
PERMANENCE OF THOSE FUNDING, SO

02:05:28.487 --> 02:05:30.456
PLEASE SPEAK TO US IF THERE'S

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:33.192
SOMETHING WE CAN DO. RIGHT NOW,

02:05:33.259 --> 02:05:36.629
AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BOND

02:05:36.695 --> 02:05:37.129
TO GET THAT LANGUAGE IN,

02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:39.365
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S ONE WORD

02:05:39.431 --> 02:05:41.467
AND THAT CAN MAKE ALL THE

02:05:41.533 --> 02:05:45.037
DIFFERENCE. AND I DO LIKE YOUR

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:47.273
TERM OF FIX AND FUND. I'M GOING

02:05:47.339 --> 02:05:49.241
TO START USING THAT. I THINK

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:51.143
THAT'S A REALLY BRIGHT WAY. I

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:53.345
WAS ON LOCAL CITY COUNCIL. I'M

02:05:53.412 --> 02:05:55.247
JUST REALLY AGING MYSELF NOW.

02:05:55.314 --> 02:05:58.617
15 YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD

02:05:58.684 --> 02:06:01.820
REDEVELOPMENT, AND I KNOW I WAS

02:06:01.887 --> 02:06:05.124
THERE WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN WAS

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:07.259
THERE AND WE MOVED FORWARD, I

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:09.161
WOULD SAY, CERTAINLY WE WANT

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:12.364
TOOLS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:14.199
INCENTIVES TO TO GET SOME OF

02:06:14.266 --> 02:06:18.137
THIS HOUSING BUILT. BUT IT'S A

02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:20.306
LOT OF THIS LIES IN THE

02:06:20.372 --> 02:06:21.740
CALIFORNIA STATE BUDGET, AND

02:06:21.807 --> 02:06:23.208
WE'VE BEEN EXTREMELY LIMITED IN

02:06:23.275 --> 02:06:25.244
THE LAST TWO YEARS AND GOING

02:06:25.311 --> 02:06:27.146
INTO NEXT YEAR, YOU KNOW, I

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:31.050
DON'T SEE. YOU KNOW, IT JUST

02:06:31.116 --> 02:06:33.619
OPENING WIDE UP, WHICH GOES

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:35.354
BACK TO THE PLACES. HOW CAN WE

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:37.456
BUILD THESE UNITS? I THINK ONE

02:06:37.523 --> 02:06:39.024
OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS WAS 500

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:44.797
AND SIX, CLOSE TO 600,000 FOR A

02:06:44.863 --> 02:06:47.566
UNIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT.

02:06:47.633 --> 02:06:50.436
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY HOPEFUL

02:06:50.502 --> 02:06:52.938
THAT THERE WILL BE SOME

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:54.540
DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES. AND I

02:06:54.606 --> 02:06:56.275
KNOW MYSELF AND OTHERS ARE

02:06:56.342 --> 02:06:58.510
TAKING TOURS THIS FALL. WE'RE

02:06:58.577 --> 02:06:59.345
ACTUALLY GOING TO GO LOOK AT

02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:01.280
SOME MODULAR HOUSING. WE'RE

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:02.648
GOING TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS.

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:05.184
BUT THAT PRICE POINT SOMETIMES

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:09.288
I'VE HEARD EVEN $700,000 FOR AN

02:07:09.355 --> 02:07:12.524
AFFORDABLE WE HAVE TO BE MORE

02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:15.694
INNOVATIVE WITH OPPORTUNITIES

02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:18.530
TO TO LOOK TO BUILD DIFFERENT

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:21.066
SIZES, SHAPES AND SO FORTH. BUT

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:24.470
WITH THAT, I AM HOPEFUL. I HAVE

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:27.306
SEEN PROGRESS. I'M HOPEFUL

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:29.441
BECAUSE THIS TEAM HERE TO ME IS

02:07:29.508 --> 02:07:31.310
INCREDIBLY BRIGHT. I WOULD JUST

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:33.412
SAY ONE AREA THAT WAS NOT

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:35.147
TOUCHED ON AT ALL TODAY, AND

02:07:35.214 --> 02:07:37.383
I'M REALLY PLEADING AND HOPING

02:07:37.449 --> 02:07:40.185
WE CAN GET A BILL FOR ADU

02:07:40.252 --> 02:07:42.287
FINANCING, BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:44.189
THAT'S BEEN A BRIGHT SPOT AS

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:46.291
FAR AS THE NUMBERS OF UNITS,

02:07:46.358 --> 02:07:48.093
BUT THERE IS ALSO A CAPACITY

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:51.330
OUT THERE WHERE PEOPLE MY AGE

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:54.166
HAVE THE LAND WANT TO DO IT.

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:55.467
BUT THE OTHER THAN TAKING A

02:07:55.534 --> 02:07:57.603
SECOND OUT ON YOUR HOME, THERE

02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:59.304
ARE VERY FEW OPTIONS OUT THERE.

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:00.973
I KNOW THERE'S A HELOC AND SO

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:02.274
FORTH, BUT GETTING THROUGH

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:04.843
BANKING, A BILL ON FINANCING

02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:06.578
AND BANKING WORLD,

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:08.313
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A

02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:09.415
GOOD INVESTMENT FOR THEM

02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:11.250
BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS THEY

02:08:11.316 --> 02:08:13.619
HAVEN'T. IT'S USUALLY A

02:08:13.685 --> 02:08:15.154
CONSTRUCTION LOAN AND IT'S IT'S

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.389
JUST NOT A FIT FOR AN AVERAGE.

02:08:17.456 --> 02:08:19.258
I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THAT

02:08:19.324 --> 02:08:21.326
BEFORE. SO WITH THAT, I DON'T

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:23.095
KNOW IF I ASKED ANY QUESTIONS.

02:08:23.162 --> 02:08:25.364
I JUST TALKED A LOT, BUT I

02:08:25.431 --> 02:08:28.000
THINK YOU HEAR ME. THANK YOU

02:08:28.067 --> 02:08:29.201
FOR ALL YOUR WORK. THANK YOU.

02:08:29.268 --> 02:08:33.238
THANK YOU SO MUCH. HI. HOW'S

02:08:33.305 --> 02:08:36.041
EVERYBODY DOING? I CAME IN

02:08:36.108 --> 02:08:38.143
TOWARDS THE TAIL END, BUT I DID

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:39.378
HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO READ OVER

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:40.646
SOME OF THE SLIDES THAT WERE

02:08:40.712 --> 02:08:43.182
PROVIDED. AND SO AS MY

02:08:43.248 --> 02:08:44.483
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED, I'M THE

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.051
ASSISTANT MAJORITY LEADER FOR

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:48.821
POLICY AND RESEARCH. AND SO WE

02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:50.155
PULLED TOGETHER A AFFORDABILITY

02:08:50.222 --> 02:08:52.257
BRIEFING TO GIVE TO THE

02:08:52.324 --> 02:08:53.325
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. AND SO I

02:08:53.392 --> 02:08:55.461
JUST WANTED TO ASK A COUPLE OF

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:56.528
QUESTIONS TO AS IT PERTAINS TO

02:08:56.595 --> 02:08:58.363
THAT, BUT THEN LISTEN TO AN

02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:59.298
OKAY. TO ANN'S CONVERSATION

02:08:59.364 --> 02:09:01.333
WHEN I FIRST CAME IN, FIRST OFF,

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.368
YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU SAID

02:09:03.435 --> 02:09:06.171
THERE WAS 16,000 AFFORDABLE

02:09:06.238 --> 02:09:07.406
HOUSING UNITS THAT WAS BUILT

02:09:07.473 --> 02:09:10.242
OUT OF, WHAT, 20? OH, THAT'S

02:09:10.309 --> 02:09:12.544
JUST OUR HISTORY IN THE LAST 35

02:09:12.611 --> 02:09:15.380
YEARS AND 35 YEARS, OUT OF HOW

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:18.617
MANY? CALIFORNIA. OUT OF 20,000.

02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:21.320
OKAY. SO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO

02:09:21.386 --> 02:09:22.087
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I

02:09:22.154 --> 02:09:23.422
WASN'T HERE FOR THE FIRST PART.

02:09:23.489 --> 02:09:25.390
SO MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:27.693
THEN HOW HOW ARE WE DEFINING

02:09:27.759 --> 02:09:28.494
AFFORDABILITY? HAVE ANYONE

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:30.028
ACTUALLY ADDRESSED THAT IN

02:09:30.095 --> 02:09:31.497
THEIR PRESENTATIONS ON WHAT

02:09:31.563 --> 02:09:33.332
AFFORDABILITY ACTUALLY IS, HOW

02:09:33.398 --> 02:09:34.800
IT'S BEING DEFINED AND LOOKED

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:37.536
AT? WE DID NOT DEFINE THAT, BUT

02:09:37.603 --> 02:09:38.537
WE LIKE TO THINK OF HOUSING

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:39.571
AFFORDABILITY AS FOLKS SPEND

02:09:39.638 --> 02:09:41.240
HOUSEHOLD SPENDING 30% OR LESS

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:42.808
OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING

02:09:42.875 --> 02:09:45.244
COSTS. OKAY. SO WHEN WE'RE

02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:47.679
SAYING 30%, ACCORDING TO SOME

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:48.680
OF OUR INFORMATION, WE'RE

02:09:48.747 --> 02:09:53.051
SAYING THAT IN 2024, THE FAIR

02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:55.254
MARKET RATE FOR TWO BEDROOM

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:58.190
APARTMENT IN THE STATE WAS

02:09:58.257 --> 02:10:00.259
$2,464. AND TO AFFORD THIS,

02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:01.593
THAT GOES INTO THE PAYING MORE

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.462
THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME. AND

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:04.396
THAT MEANS THAT THEY MUST EARN

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:08.167
AT LEAST 98,000 $545,000

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:10.936
ANNUALLY. AND SO THAT

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:13.472
TRANSLATES INTO $47.38 AN HOUR,

02:10:13.539 --> 02:10:14.439
WHICH IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:15.541
WITHIN THE NATION. THAT'S WHERE

02:10:15.607 --> 02:10:19.311
WE'RE AT. SO IN YOUR REPORT, I

02:10:19.378 --> 02:10:20.579
DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT PAGE

02:10:20.646 --> 02:10:23.615
NUMBER, BUT YOU'RE GOING INTO

02:10:23.682 --> 02:10:24.483
CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS OF AT LEAST

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:26.318
1 MILLION MORE HOMES IN LOW

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:28.320
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. HOW WHAT ARE

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:29.254
WE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT,

02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:31.557
KNOWING THAT NO ONE'S THERE ARE

02:10:31.623 --> 02:10:32.891
PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING $47 AN

02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:34.326
HOUR OR $0.38. RIGHT. BUT THEN

02:10:34.393 --> 02:10:36.461
WHEN YOU GO INTO THE LOW, YOU

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:38.096
HAVE EXTREMELY LOW AND VERY LOW

02:10:38.163 --> 02:10:39.565
INCOME AND THEN LOW INCOME.

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:41.633
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ADDRESS

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:43.068
THAT SIDE OF THINGS? BECAUSE

02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:47.439
THAT'S NOT BALANCING OUT PER SE.

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:50.309
SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. YEAH, I'M

02:10:50.375 --> 02:10:52.144
HAPPY TO TALK TO A LITTLE BIT

02:10:52.211 --> 02:10:53.345
ABOUT THAT. AND WITH MY

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:55.013
PRESENTATION ON, YOU KNOW,

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.248
MARKET RATE RENTS ARE NEVER

02:10:56.315 --> 02:10:58.483
GOING TO GET TO POPULATIONS

02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:59.451
THAT ARE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

02:10:59.518 --> 02:11:01.186
OR VERY LOW INCOME IN A LOT OF

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:02.421
WAYS. AND SO THAT'S WHERE

02:11:02.487 --> 02:11:04.323
PUBLIC SUBSIDY BECOMES VERY

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:06.458
IMPORTANT TO FILL THE GAPS IN

02:11:06.525 --> 02:11:08.427
ORDER TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE OR

02:11:08.493 --> 02:11:10.095
TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:12.197
ACTUALLY PENCIL OUT. AND SO IN

02:11:12.264 --> 02:11:13.365
THIS TALK ABOUT FUNDING IS

02:11:13.432 --> 02:11:14.166
SUPER IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:15.400
BECAUSE STATE FUNDING PROVIDES

02:11:15.467 --> 02:11:17.369
A REALLY INCREDIBLE RESOURCE TO

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:18.503
ACTUALLY FILL THAT GAP. SO WE

02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:20.706
CAN USE THOSE FEDERAL RESOURCES

02:11:20.772 --> 02:11:23.208
AND PRIVATE LENDERS IN A WAY TO

02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:25.210
ACTUALLY MAKE AFFORDABLE

02:11:25.277 --> 02:11:26.411
HOUSING. PENCIL OUT FOR THE

02:11:26.478 --> 02:11:29.181
PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING LESS THAN

02:11:29.248 --> 02:11:33.585
$98,000 A YEAR. OKAY, SO IF

02:11:33.652 --> 02:11:34.620
IT'S THE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES THAT

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:36.588
WE WOULD NEED TO BE LOOKING AT

02:11:36.655 --> 02:11:38.190
AND SOME ADDITIONAL STATE

02:11:38.257 --> 02:11:39.524
FUNDING, THAT GOES BACK TO WHAT

02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:41.393
I WAS GOING TO ASK AND, AND ALL

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.395
OF YOU CAN DO IT THEN WHAT

02:11:43.462 --> 02:11:45.631
OTHER PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE?

02:11:45.697 --> 02:11:47.366
MEANING HOW ARE PEOPLE

02:11:47.432 --> 02:11:49.635
QUALIFYING FOR THE PROGRAMS?

02:11:49.701 --> 02:11:51.270
NUMBER ONE, SOME OF IT IS BASED

02:11:51.336 --> 02:11:53.338
ON THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL,

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:54.573
SOME ARE BASED ON OTHER THINGS

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.475
AND SO FORTH. BUT THEN WHEN

02:11:56.541 --> 02:11:59.044
IT'S COMING INTO SOME OF THE

02:11:59.111 --> 02:12:00.445
HOMEBUYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

02:12:00.512 --> 02:12:02.347
OR WHICHEVER, HOW ARE PEOPLE

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:03.649
QUALIFYING? BECAUSE THE NUMBER

02:12:03.715 --> 02:12:04.449
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE QUALIFYING

02:12:04.516 --> 02:12:05.651
ARE NOT PARTICULARLY FALLING

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:07.252
INTO THE CATEGORIES OF THOSE

02:12:07.319 --> 02:12:08.420
THAT ARE EXTREMELY IN NEED. AND

02:12:08.487 --> 02:12:10.188
THAT'S GOING INTO THE ACCESS

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:11.356
SIDE OF IT, OF THE

02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:12.157
AFFORDABILITY OF THEIR DEBT,

02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:13.258
THEIR CREDIT SCORE AND AND

02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:15.394
THEIR LIVABLE WAGES. SO HOW ARE

02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:16.962
WE DISTRIBUTING THAT FUNDS AND

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:18.096
IS IT BEING DISTRIBUTED

02:12:18.163 --> 02:12:20.332
EQUITABLY ACROSS THE BOARD?

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:22.134
BECAUSE I'M BIG ON ADDRESSING

02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.070
EQUITY AND ACCESS. AND I WOULD

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:27.506
LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:12:27.572 --> 02:12:30.542
ABOUT THAT. YEAH. SO TO IN THE

02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:32.177
APPLICATION PROCESS, MANY

02:12:32.244 --> 02:12:33.545
DEVELOPERS HAVE TO SAY WHAT AMI

02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:35.280
LEVELS ARE REACHING. SO AREA

02:12:35.347 --> 02:12:36.882
MEDIAN INCOME LEVELS ARE

02:12:36.948 --> 02:12:38.517
REACHING A LOT OF PROGRAMS

02:12:38.583 --> 02:12:41.320
SPECIFY FOR YOU KNOW, THEY THEY

02:12:41.386 --> 02:12:43.255
AWARD POINTS BASED ON HOW LOW

02:12:43.322 --> 02:12:46.591
OF A LEVEL THEY CAN REACH FOR

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:48.126
AMI LEVELS. SO DEPENDING ON THE

02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:49.361
APPLICATION AND WHAT THEY'RE

02:12:49.428 --> 02:12:51.296
FUNDING, YOU WOULD HAVE TO

02:12:51.363 --> 02:12:53.065
REACH THOSE AMI LEVELS FOR THE

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:54.199
DEVELOPMENT. AND ON THE

02:12:54.266 --> 02:12:55.233
DEVELOPMENT SIDE THEY WOULD

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.202
HAVE TO CHECK THE THE INCOMES

02:12:57.269 --> 02:12:59.171
OF THE INDIVIDUALS APPLYING FOR

02:12:59.237 --> 02:13:00.405
THE HOUSING AND MIGHT KNOW WAY

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:02.240
MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO, BUT

02:13:02.307 --> 02:13:04.242
THEY HAVE TO CHECK THE INCOMES.

02:13:04.309 --> 02:13:06.678
AND EVERY YEAR I WANT TO SAY

02:13:06.745 --> 02:13:08.513
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY

02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:09.715
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:10.949
STILL CONSISTENT WITH THE

02:13:11.016 --> 02:13:12.351
INCOME LEVELS THERE. BUT THEN

02:13:12.417 --> 02:13:14.386
IS THAT KIND OF ANSWER YOUR

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:15.187
QUESTION IS GOING INTO IT. BUT

02:13:15.253 --> 02:13:16.488
THEN IF WE'RE CHECKING THE

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:18.390
INCOMES ONCE AGAIN, SOME OF US

02:13:18.457 --> 02:13:20.125
AND I'M GOING TO JUST THROW

02:13:20.192 --> 02:13:21.226
MYSELF IN THERE BECAUSE AT ONE

02:13:21.293 --> 02:13:23.328
POINT I DID NOT QUALIFY FOR A

02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:24.429
NUMBER OF THINGS, WHETHER I WAS

02:13:24.496 --> 02:13:26.331
TOO HIGH ON ONE END OR, YOU

02:13:26.398 --> 02:13:27.466
KNOW, WHICHEVER. SO WHAT ABOUT

02:13:27.532 --> 02:13:29.167
THOSE PEOPLE THAT MEET IN THE

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:30.369
MIDDLE? BECAUSE FOR DIFFERENT

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:33.004
PARTS OF MY DISTRICT, WE KNOW

02:13:33.071 --> 02:13:34.339
THAT THE HOUSING ITSELF IS

02:13:34.406 --> 02:13:36.575
BASED ON THE ACTUAL THE MEDIAN

02:13:36.641 --> 02:13:38.276
INCOME, RIGHT. AND THE MEDIAN

02:13:38.343 --> 02:13:39.344
INCOME WITHIN THE AREA IS NOT

02:13:39.411 --> 02:13:41.546
ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE SAME FOR

02:13:41.613 --> 02:13:42.381
EVERYBODY ELSE. AND IT VARIES

02:13:42.447 --> 02:13:44.483
FROM CITY TO CITY. SO FOR

02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:46.752
EXAMPLE, LEMON GROVE, I THINK

02:13:46.818 --> 02:13:48.120
IT WAS ONCE AGAIN $97,000.

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:49.354
THEREFORE THE RENTS ARE GOING

02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:51.356
AT A DIFFERENT RATE. SO WHEN

02:13:51.423 --> 02:13:53.291
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:54.626
BEING ELIGIBLE FOR INCOME BASED

02:13:54.693 --> 02:13:56.294
ON THEIR INCOME, ONCE AGAIN I'M

02:13:56.361 --> 02:13:58.430
GOING INTO HOW ARE WE ASSISTING

02:13:58.497 --> 02:13:59.631
THOSE OR FINDING SOME OTHER WAY,

02:13:59.698 --> 02:14:01.166
OR GIVE ME SOME RECOMMENDATIONS

02:14:01.233 --> 02:14:03.368
FOR US TO ASSIST WITH MAKING

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:05.036
SURE THAT WE ARE INCREASING

02:14:05.103 --> 02:14:06.671
ACCESS AND NOT SOLELY ALWAYS

02:14:06.738 --> 02:14:08.840
GOING OFF OF. YOU NEED TO HAVE

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:10.208
3 TO 4 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF

02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:11.410
MONEY IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TO

02:14:11.476 --> 02:14:12.644
ACCEPT. NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.579
TO HAVE THAT. YEAH. SO WHAT

02:14:14.646 --> 02:14:16.081
ELSE CAN WE DO TO ENSURE EQUITY

02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:18.049
BUT ALSO ACCESS BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:14:18.116 --> 02:14:19.251
THE HOMELESSNESS HOMELESS

02:14:19.317 --> 02:14:21.486
CRISIS IS INCREASING. AND IT'S

02:14:21.553 --> 02:14:23.255
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL

02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:24.389
CANNOT AFFORD TO MAINTAIN IN

02:14:24.456 --> 02:14:26.358
THEIR HOMES. BEFORE YOU GO TO

02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:27.292
THAT, I'M JUST GOING TO TELL

02:14:27.359 --> 02:14:29.327
YOU THAT THE FROM ONE OF THE

02:14:29.394 --> 02:14:30.862
REPORTS THAT WE HAVE THE

02:14:30.929 --> 02:14:31.396
FOLLOWING ESTIMATE FOR THE

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:32.264
MONTHLY MORTGAGE PAYMENT AND

02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:33.765
PROPERTY TAXES FOR THE MEDIAN

02:14:33.832 --> 02:14:35.100
HOMES, AND THAT'S SHOWING THE

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:37.202
ACTUAL PERCENTAGE PERCENTAGE IN

02:14:37.269 --> 02:14:40.439
LA ITSELF FOR MEDIAN INCOME FOR

02:14:40.505 --> 02:14:41.239
APRIL 2025, THE SALES RATE FOR

02:14:41.306 --> 02:14:44.376
A NEW HOME WAS 1,039,000, AND

02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:46.111
THEN THE ESTIMATED MONTHLY

02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:48.580
MORTGAGE AND PROPERTY TAXES

02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:50.549
8066. SO THAT MEANS THE MONTHLY

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:54.052
COUNTY 2025 AREA MEDIAN INCOME

02:14:54.119 --> 02:14:57.222
THAT THE HCD IS 8000 883,000,

02:14:57.289 --> 02:14:58.623
BUT THE MORTGAGE AND PROPERTY

02:14:58.690 --> 02:15:00.692
TAX AS A PERCENTAGE OF MEDIAN

02:15:00.759 --> 02:15:03.195
INCOME IS 91%. THAT'S LA. SO IF

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:06.264
I GO TO SAN DIEGO IS ABOUT 71%

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:07.532
AND THE AVERAGE MEDIAN THE

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:10.602
HOUSE IS BEING SOLD WAS 990,000.

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:12.471
AND IT CONTINUES ON. SO THE

02:15:12.537 --> 02:15:13.371
IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:16.074
A HOME FOR SO MANY IS SO FAR

02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:17.175
FEW IN BETWEEN. SO WHAT CAN WE

02:15:17.242 --> 02:15:19.678
DO TO TRY TO CORRECT THAT? I'M

02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:21.146
SORRY, I'M JUST. NO, I MEAN,

02:15:21.213 --> 02:15:23.215
YOU DON'T NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:24.282
THIS IS OUR SHOW. SO THIS IS

02:15:24.349 --> 02:15:27.285
WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. SO I GOTTA

02:15:27.352 --> 02:15:28.453
ADOPT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. I'M

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.255
NOT SORRY. NO, BUT CAN SOMEONE

02:15:30.322 --> 02:15:32.224
JUST KIND OF HELP ME UNDERSTAND

02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:33.425
WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS?

02:15:33.492 --> 02:15:35.026
YEAH, I CAN START. AND THEN I

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:36.294
INVITE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN IN.

02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:38.029
I THINK YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE

02:15:38.096 --> 02:15:39.564
WHOLE SPECTRUM. THE WHOLE

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:42.300
CONTINUUM THAT WE NEED TO

02:15:42.367 --> 02:15:44.069
RESPOND TO HOUSING NEEDS. RIGHT.

02:15:44.135 --> 02:15:45.704
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:48.340
DO WE LEVERAGE OUR SCARCE

02:15:48.406 --> 02:15:50.308
RESOURCES FOR DEEPEST IMPACT,

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:52.911
IT REALLY IS THINKING ABOUT ON

02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:53.545
THAT WHOLE CONTINUUM, WHERE CAN

02:15:53.612 --> 02:15:55.313
WE INTERVENE IN THE MOST

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:57.148
IMPACTFUL WAY? YOU KNOW, WE'RE

02:15:57.215 --> 02:15:58.517
TRYING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

02:15:58.583 --> 02:15:59.551
FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS.

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:01.520
WE'RE TRYING TO PULL PEOPLE OUT

02:16:01.586 --> 02:16:03.121
OF HOMELESSNESS, RIGHT, AND GET

02:16:03.188 --> 02:16:04.422
THEM HOUSED. AND AT THE OTHER

02:16:04.489 --> 02:16:06.458
END OF THE SCALE, HOMEOWNERSHIP

02:16:06.525 --> 02:16:08.326
IS OUT OF REACH FOR MANY. SO WE

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:09.361
ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT WHOLE

02:16:09.427 --> 02:16:12.330
RANGE. A LOT OF HCD'S SUBSIDY

02:16:12.397 --> 02:16:15.400
IS GEARED TOWARDS PRIORITIZING

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:17.736
DEEPER AFFORDABILITY. SO THOSE

02:16:17.802 --> 02:16:20.572
30% UNITS, YOU KNOW, EVEN 50%

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:22.374
UNITS, WE JUST ARE NOT GOING TO

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:24.476
GET THAT FROM THE MARKET. AND

02:16:24.543 --> 02:16:25.710
SO WE REALLY DO NEED THAT EXTRA

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:27.345
SUBSIDY TO GET US THERE. AND

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:28.547
THAT'S GOING TO GET US, YOU

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.315
KNOW, THE UNITS THAT ARE GOING

02:16:30.382 --> 02:16:31.483
TO HOUSE PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE

02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:33.084
BEEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

02:16:33.151 --> 02:16:35.253
OR OR COULD BE AT RISK OF

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.255
HOMELESSNESS, AND THAT FITS

02:16:37.322 --> 02:16:39.491
INTO JUST AN OVERALL STATE

02:16:39.558 --> 02:16:40.225
PRIORITIES OF ADDRESSING THE

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:43.161
CRISIS. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN

02:16:43.228 --> 02:16:45.397
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO OTHER

02:16:45.463 --> 02:16:47.198
THINGS. RIGHT. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

02:16:47.265 --> 02:16:49.768
IF THERE IS A WAY TO MIX UNITS,

02:16:49.834 --> 02:16:51.136
KIND OF RECOGNIZING THAT, IT'S

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:53.238
REALLY HARD TO DO ONLY HOMELESS

02:16:53.305 --> 02:16:55.106
UNITS IN A PROJECT, A LOT OF

02:16:55.173 --> 02:16:57.842
PROJECTS WILL HAVE A MIX OF

02:16:57.909 --> 02:16:59.344
AFFORDABILITY WITH DIFFERENT

02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:00.579
TIERS. AND SO THERE'S A RANGE

02:17:00.645 --> 02:17:01.279
OF APPLICANTS, YOU KNOW,

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:04.082
GETTING TO THE IDEA OF ACCESS

02:17:04.149 --> 02:17:05.150
AND, AND EQUITY, YOU KNOW,

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:07.218
TRYING TO HAVE A MIX OF UNITS

02:17:07.285 --> 02:17:08.620
SO THAT PEOPLE IN ONE COMMUNITY

02:17:08.687 --> 02:17:09.788
CAN STILL ACCESS DIFFERENT

02:17:09.854 --> 02:17:12.223
LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY. AND AT

02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:13.525
THE SAME TIME, I THINK YOU'RE

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:15.293
TOTALLY SPEAKING TO A REALLY

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.361
CRITICAL PIECE, WHICH IS THE

02:17:16.428 --> 02:17:18.129
MISSING MIDDLE. LIKE WE JUST DO

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:19.297
NOT HAVE GREAT SOLUTIONS YET TO

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:21.600
THAT. AND SOME OF IT IS, YOU

02:17:21.666 --> 02:17:23.401
KNOW, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE

02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:24.336
THE BEST USE OF OUR SUBSIDY,

02:17:24.402 --> 02:17:26.404
YOU KNOW, TO PUT IT ALL INTO,

02:17:26.471 --> 02:17:27.639
YOU KNOW, CREATING MIDDLE

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:28.373
INCOME HOUSING, PROBABLY, YOU

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.308
KNOW, IT'S A DISCUSSION TO HAVE.

02:17:30.375 --> 02:17:32.444
BUT I DO THINK THERE'S A WAY

02:17:32.510 --> 02:17:33.545
THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN

02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:34.446
THINKING IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

02:17:34.512 --> 02:17:36.514
THINK ABOUT HOW TO UNLOCK THE

02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:38.516
MARKET TO DELIVER THOSE UNITS

02:17:38.583 --> 02:17:40.685
MORE CHEAPLY, AND THEREFORE HIT

02:17:40.752 --> 02:17:41.753
A LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY FOR

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:43.388
MIDDLE AND MODERATE INCOME

02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:45.357
HOUSEHOLDS. SO, YOU KNOW, HOW

02:17:45.423 --> 02:17:47.125
DO WE ENCOURAGE, YOU KNOW,

02:17:47.192 --> 02:17:49.427
UNITS THAT ARE, YOU KNOW,

02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:51.162
THEY'RE NOT SUPER LOW INCOME,

02:17:51.229 --> 02:17:52.397
AFFORDABLE FOREVER, BUT THEY'RE

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:54.032
LIKE PRETTY AFFORDABLE AND NOT

02:17:54.099 --> 02:17:55.400
THE CRAZY MARKET RATES. LIKE,

02:17:55.467 --> 02:17:58.036
HOW CAN WE ENCOURAGE, YOU KNOW,

02:17:58.103 --> 02:17:59.004
BUILDING TYPOLOGIES THAT CAN

02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:01.439
ENABLE THAT? HOW DO WE UNLOCK

02:18:01.506 --> 02:18:02.841
THE LAND USE THROUGH THE

02:18:02.907 --> 02:18:04.109
HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS AND

02:18:04.175 --> 02:18:06.244
REALLY PUSH JURISDICTIONS TO

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:07.579
LIKE AND SAID, LIKE OPEN UP

02:18:07.646 --> 02:18:09.114
THEIR BOOK, LIKE, WHAT DO YOU

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:11.349
HAVE ON YOUR MAP THAT CAN TURN

02:18:11.416 --> 02:18:12.484
INTO HOUSING AND LIKE, LET'S DO

02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:14.219
THOSE AND DO IT QUICKLY AND

02:18:14.286 --> 02:18:15.420
CHEAPLY. AND SO THAT'S SORT OF

02:18:15.487 --> 02:18:16.621
THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE.

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:18.223
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE DO HAVE

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.325
HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS AS WELL.

02:18:20.392 --> 02:18:22.127
AND I THINK ALSO TO YOUR POINT,

02:18:22.193 --> 02:18:24.696
I MEAN, AND THIS IS WHY I LOVE

02:18:24.763 --> 02:18:25.730
THAT YOU'RE PART OF THIS

02:18:25.797 --> 02:18:27.298
COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:29.267
ALWAYS LOOKING THROUGH THAT

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:31.302
LENS OF EQUITY. AND

02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:34.339
UNFORTUNATELY, HOUSING. IT'S AN

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:37.142
OUTDATED MODEL. AS SOMEONE

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:39.444
WHO'S BEEN IN THAT SPACE, AND I

02:18:39.511 --> 02:18:40.178
THINK THIS COMMITTEE, WHAT'S

02:18:40.245 --> 02:18:41.379
REALLY EXCITING ABOUT THIS

02:18:41.446 --> 02:18:43.682
COMMITTEE, NOT ONLY THE TALENT

02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:44.315
AND THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE ALL

02:18:44.382 --> 02:18:46.151
REPRESENT, DIFFERENT AREAS OF

02:18:46.217 --> 02:18:47.819
CALIFORNIA, IS THAT I THINK WE

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:49.087
HAVE A REALLY UNIQUE

02:18:49.154 --> 02:18:51.623
OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE ARE

02:18:51.690 --> 02:18:53.058
CHARGED BY THE SPEAKER IN

02:18:53.124 --> 02:18:54.759
DIFFERENT AREAS, FROM CHILDCARE

02:18:54.826 --> 02:18:58.129
TO HOUSING, TO ADDRESS THE

02:18:58.196 --> 02:18:59.664
AFFORDABILITY. AND I THINK THIS

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:03.501
IS OUR TIME TO BE UNINHIBITED,

02:19:03.568 --> 02:19:05.503
TO REALLY SPEAK WITH CLARITY

02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:08.206
AND DIRECTION, AND TO EDUCATE

02:19:08.273 --> 02:19:10.442
OURSELVES IN SPACES THAT WE

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:12.277
DON'T KNOW AND SPACES THAT WE

02:19:12.343 --> 02:19:14.612
DO KNOW THAT AREN'T WORKING TO

02:19:14.679 --> 02:19:16.448
RECALIBRATE A LOT OF THE STATE

02:19:16.514 --> 02:19:18.116
AGENCIES. BUT I THINK GOING

02:19:18.183 --> 02:19:21.352
BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE'S POINT,

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:24.089
THE MISSING MIDDLE, YOU KNOW,

02:19:24.155 --> 02:19:25.490
THE SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE, WHAT

02:19:25.557 --> 02:19:27.859
I CALL THE HOUSING ECONOMIC

02:19:27.926 --> 02:19:31.329
LADDER, THE VERY LOW INCOME,

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:33.064
THAT IS WHERE THE FEDERAL

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:34.199
GOVERNMENT WAS STRUCTURED. THE

02:19:34.265 --> 02:19:35.400
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN

02:19:35.467 --> 02:19:37.368
DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS UNDER

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:38.403
ATTACK NOW, STATES WEREN'T

02:19:38.470 --> 02:19:40.538
REALLY SET UP TO TAKE CARE OF

02:19:40.605 --> 02:19:42.440
THE VERY LOW INCOME AND THE

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:44.242
VERY LOW INCOME, FIXED INCOME

02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:46.377
INDIVIDUALS. OUR VETERANS ARE,

02:19:46.444 --> 02:19:48.880
YOU KNOW, MOBILITY IMPAIRED

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:51.349
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL NEVER BE

02:19:51.416 --> 02:19:54.919
ABLE TO, BECAUSE OF LIFE

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:56.054
CIRCUMSTANCES, ACHIEVE, YOU

02:19:56.121 --> 02:19:59.758
KNOW, HAVING AN INCOME TO PUT

02:19:59.824 --> 02:20:01.092
THEM IN THE HOMEBUYER REALM.

02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:03.394
AND SO THE RENTAL MARKET IS SO

02:20:03.461 --> 02:20:05.096
CRITICAL IN THAT SPACE, AND

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.498
IT'S THE LEAST FUNDED COMPARED

02:20:06.564 --> 02:20:09.033
TO THE HOMEOWNERSHIP SIDE. AND

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:10.535
SO I THINK THIS COMMITTEE IS,

02:20:10.602 --> 02:20:13.037
YOU KNOW, HOW DO HOW DO WE

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:16.574
BALANCE THAT. AND, YOU KNOW,

02:20:16.641 --> 02:20:19.043
BEYOND THOSE LOGISTICS, WE HAVE

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:21.412
A POVERTY PROBLEM AND WE CAN'T

02:20:21.479 --> 02:20:24.649
SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS WHEN

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:25.350
WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE

02:20:25.416 --> 02:20:27.585
POVERTY PROBLEM. AND SO I HOPE

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:29.387
PART OF OUR DIALOG HERE IS

02:20:29.454 --> 02:20:31.389
GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:20:31.456 --> 02:20:33.224
POVERTY PROBLEM THAT IS TIED TO

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:35.960
OUR EDUCATION PROBLEM. AND

02:20:36.027 --> 02:20:38.229
THOSE TWO TOGETHER, 50% OF THE

02:20:38.296 --> 02:20:40.698
STATE'S BUDGET GOES TO

02:20:40.765 --> 02:20:42.734
EDUCATION. BUT YET THE OUTCOMES

02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:45.503
OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AREN'T

02:20:45.570 --> 02:20:47.138
PUTTING PEOPLE IN A SOCIALLY

02:20:47.205 --> 02:20:50.074
ECONOMIC POSITION TO BE ABLE TO

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:52.544
POSITION THEMSELVES TO HOUSING.

02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:54.045
AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE. I KNOW

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:57.015
THAT'S A SPACE VERY DEAR TO

02:20:57.081 --> 02:21:00.151
YOUR HEART. SO YEAH, I HAD THAT.

02:21:00.218 --> 02:21:02.687
DID YOU DID YOU ON THE

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:04.155
HOMEOWNERSHIP SIDE, I WANTED TO

02:21:04.222 --> 02:21:05.356
ADDRESS SOME OF THAT IN THE

02:21:05.423 --> 02:21:07.725
EQUITY OF THAT. SO CALHFA, I

02:21:07.792 --> 02:21:09.160
THINK ONE OF THE RESPONSES WE

02:21:09.227 --> 02:21:10.728
HAVE IS DIVERSIFYING THE

02:21:10.795 --> 02:21:12.096
PRODUCTS THAT WE ARE OFFERING

02:21:12.163 --> 02:21:13.531
TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. SO IN THE

02:21:13.598 --> 02:21:15.366
LAST YEAR, CALHFA HAS ACTUALLY

02:21:15.433 --> 02:21:16.801
LAUNCHED A SECOND DOWNPAYMENT

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:19.237
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT'S THE

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:20.672
MY ACCESS PROGRAM. SO COMBINED

02:21:20.738 --> 02:21:22.640
WITH MY HOME AND MY ACCESS,

02:21:22.707 --> 02:21:25.310
THAT'S 6% GIVEN TO THE

02:21:25.376 --> 02:21:26.711
HOMEOWNER FOR A DOWN PAYMENT

02:21:26.778 --> 02:21:28.780
FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP. BECAUSE A

02:21:28.847 --> 02:21:30.114
LOT OF THE TIMES, SOME IN

02:21:30.181 --> 02:21:31.182
CERTAIN SITUATIONS, THE

02:21:31.249 --> 02:21:33.351
MORTGAGE IS LESS THAN THE RENT,

02:21:33.418 --> 02:21:34.752
RIGHT, IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES.

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:36.254
AND SO AND THAT ACCESS TO

02:21:36.321 --> 02:21:38.423
CAPITAL IN ORDER FOR THE DOWN

02:21:38.489 --> 02:21:40.158
PAYMENT IS REALLY KIND OF A BIG

02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:41.392
BARRIER, THE ACCESS PROGRAM.

02:21:41.459 --> 02:21:43.328
AND WHAT THE THE GREAT THING

02:21:43.394 --> 02:21:45.663
ABOUT THAT 6% IS, IS IT UNLOCKS

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.432
FINANCING FOR FACTORY BUILT

02:21:47.498 --> 02:21:50.168
HOMES. SO THOSE HOMES ARE ABLE

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:52.036
FOR A HOMEOWNER, IF YOU HAVE

02:21:52.103 --> 02:21:54.205
THE ABILITY TO GO AND PURCHASE

02:21:54.272 --> 02:21:55.573
A MODULAR OR FACTORY BUILT HOME,

02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:57.242
YOU CAN NOW USE THAT THAT OUR

02:21:57.308 --> 02:21:58.776
DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE

02:21:58.843 --> 02:22:00.578
PROGRAMS IN COMBINATION TO BE

02:22:00.645 --> 02:22:02.647
ABLE TO FINANCE THAT THROUGH A

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:04.315
GOVERNMENTAL LIKE A GSE BACKED

02:22:04.382 --> 02:22:06.551
LOAN. SO I THINK THAT DOES NOT

02:22:06.618 --> 02:22:08.319
SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. I DIDN'T IN

02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:10.989
ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. THE

02:22:11.055 --> 02:22:11.489
OTHER THING I WANTED TO

02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:12.490
HIGHLIGHT THOUGH, IS EDUCATION

02:22:12.557 --> 02:22:13.725
AND FINANCIAL LITERACY IN THE

02:22:13.791 --> 02:22:15.727
HOMEOWNERSHIP SPACE. CALHFA.

02:22:15.793 --> 02:22:16.594
ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH THE

02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:18.696
NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT

02:22:18.763 --> 02:22:20.698
FUND, DOES FUND HUD CERTIFIED

02:22:20.765 --> 02:22:22.433
HOUSING COUNSELING. IT'S A FREE

02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:24.135
SERVICE PROVIDED TO ALL

02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:25.370
CALIFORNIANS, REGARDLESS OF

02:22:25.436 --> 02:22:27.372
WHETHER YOU'RE A RENTER OR A

02:22:27.438 --> 02:22:29.107
HOMEOWNER. AND THEY DO DO

02:22:29.173 --> 02:22:31.309
MORTGAGE COUNSELING. SO SAY I

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:33.177
GO IN AND I SAY, I WANT TO BUY

02:22:33.244 --> 02:22:35.546
A HOME. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK

02:22:35.613 --> 02:22:36.347
LIKE? AND THAT FINANCIAL

02:22:36.414 --> 02:22:38.082
LITERACY. SO I THINK IT'S ALSO

02:22:38.149 --> 02:22:39.217
EDUCATING PEOPLE WHAT'S OUT

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:41.319
THERE, BUT IT'S ALSO EDUCATING

02:22:41.386 --> 02:22:42.587
THEM ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL

02:22:42.654 --> 02:22:44.322
POSITION AND WHAT THEY CAN DO

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:46.324
TO HELP GET THERE. IT'S NOT THE

02:22:46.391 --> 02:22:47.292
SOLUTION, BUT I THINK IT'S

02:22:47.358 --> 02:22:49.394
STEPS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN IN THE

02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:51.462
MORE RECENT TIME TO START

02:22:51.529 --> 02:22:53.498
GETTING US THERE FROM AN EQUITY

02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:56.067
PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU. AND I'M

02:22:56.134 --> 02:22:58.202
GOING TO I'M REALLY CURIOUS

02:22:58.269 --> 02:22:59.837
WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTHERN

02:22:59.904 --> 02:23:01.105
CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE I DO FEEL

02:23:01.172 --> 02:23:02.941
LIKE WE NEED TO DEDICATE SOME

02:23:03.007 --> 02:23:04.475
TIME AND SPACE. GIVEN Ã YOU

02:23:04.542 --> 02:23:06.711
HAVE ANY MORE? OH, I'M SORRY,

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:09.047
I'M ALMOST DONE. I PROMISE. I'M

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:11.349
ALMOST. I'M ALMOST DONE. I MEAN,

02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:12.383
BECAUSE YOU WENT INTO MY

02:23:12.450 --> 02:23:14.118
EDUCATION PART OF IT SO QUICKLY.

02:23:14.185 --> 02:23:15.386
JUST SAYING ON THAT, AS WE

02:23:15.453 --> 02:23:16.521
CONTINUE TO HAVE THE

02:23:16.587 --> 02:23:17.455
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT BUILDING

02:23:17.522 --> 02:23:18.256
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:23:18.323 --> 02:23:20.191
ENOUGH HOUSING, IT BOILS DOWN

02:23:20.258 --> 02:23:21.526
TO WHAT WAS ALREADY POINTED OUT.

02:23:21.592 --> 02:23:23.161
IF WE CAN HOUSE FOLKS, BUT DO

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:25.296
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:23:25.363 --> 02:23:26.497
SUSTAIN THE HOUSING THAT WE ARE

02:23:26.564 --> 02:23:28.132
CURRENTLY PROVIDING SO THAT

02:23:28.199 --> 02:23:30.368
THAT IS A BIG PART OF IT? JUST

02:23:30.435 --> 02:23:31.235
ANOTHER SUGGESTION. AND THEN I

02:23:31.302 --> 02:23:33.871
TOLD YOU, I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

02:23:33.938 --> 02:23:35.540
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU WAS I WOULD

02:23:35.606 --> 02:23:38.176
LIKE TO START TO HEAR AND OR

02:23:38.242 --> 02:23:39.577
SEE WITHIN REPORTS, THOUGH, IN

02:23:39.644 --> 02:23:42.580
REGARDS TO US, INCLUDING THE

02:23:42.647 --> 02:23:44.615
GENDER DISPARITIES, BECAUSE AS

02:23:44.682 --> 02:23:47.352
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ACCESS AND

02:23:47.418 --> 02:23:50.121
THE EQUITY SIDE OF THINGS, TOO

02:23:50.188 --> 02:23:52.323
OFTEN WE ARE LEAVING OUT THE

02:23:52.390 --> 02:23:53.858
CONVERSATIONS FOR THE THE BIPOC

02:23:53.925 --> 02:23:55.193
COMMUNITIES WITHIN ITSELF. AND

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:57.462
AND THERE IS A 50, 53% OF WOMEN

02:23:57.528 --> 02:23:59.163
RENTERS. THEY LIVE IN THE

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:00.531
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, COMPARED TO

02:24:00.598 --> 02:24:01.466
47% OF MEN. SO REALLY

02:24:01.532 --> 02:24:03.167
ADDRESSING THAT PART OF IT, AND

02:24:03.234 --> 02:24:06.637
ALSO THE FACT OF 63% OF BLACK

02:24:06.704 --> 02:24:08.306
WOMEN AND 54% OF THE LATINO

02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:10.441
WOMEN, WOMEN ARE RENT BURDENED.

02:24:10.508 --> 02:24:12.510
SO AS WE CONTINUE TO THINK

02:24:12.577 --> 02:24:14.212
ABOUT HOW WE'RE BUILDING AND

02:24:14.278 --> 02:24:15.346
WHAT WE'RE BUILDING AND WHERE

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:17.048
WE'RE BUILDING, AND THE COST OF

02:24:17.115 --> 02:24:18.349
THAT, NOT ONLY IS IT JUST GOING

02:24:18.416 --> 02:24:20.351
INTO THE OVERALL YOUR FULL

02:24:20.418 --> 02:24:21.319
INCOME FACTOR, BUT THEN LOOKING

02:24:21.386 --> 02:24:22.487
AT THE GENDER DISPARITIES AS

02:24:22.553 --> 02:24:24.322
WELL. AND THEN THERE'S A

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:25.289
QUALIFICATION COMPONENT THAT

02:24:25.356 --> 02:24:26.657
COMES TO THAT. WE MAY NOT WANT

02:24:26.724 --> 02:24:28.092
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BUT TOO

02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:29.460
OFTEN SOME SOME OF THE

02:24:29.527 --> 02:24:29.961
QUALIFICATIONS IS YOU'RE

02:24:30.028 --> 02:24:31.295
APPROVED AND OR DENIED. SOME OF

02:24:31.362 --> 02:24:33.297
THAT DOES STILL PLAY INTO THE

02:24:33.364 --> 02:24:34.465
FACTORS, WHETHER WE WANT TO

02:24:34.532 --> 02:24:36.067
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OR NOT. SO I

02:24:36.134 --> 02:24:37.301
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEE A LITTLE

02:24:37.368 --> 02:24:39.337
BIT MORE OF THE GENDER

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:39.804
DISPARITIES ALSO BEING

02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:41.139
ADDRESSED AS WE CONTINUE TO

02:24:41.205 --> 02:24:42.940
FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:24:43.007 --> 02:24:43.474
ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY

02:24:43.541 --> 02:24:45.243
CRISIS WITHIN THE STATE. SO I

02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:47.311
WILL PAUSE THERE. I HAVE MORE,

02:24:47.378 --> 02:24:48.446
BUT I WILL PAUSE THERE. YOU

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:50.281
DON'T NEED TO PAUSE IF YOU HAVE

02:24:50.348 --> 02:24:51.382
MORE QUESTIONS. WE WE CAN. I

02:24:51.449 --> 02:24:53.084
THOUGHT YOU WERE FINISHED, SO I

02:24:53.151 --> 02:24:54.318
APOLOGIZE. SO YOU CAN FINISH

02:24:54.385 --> 02:24:56.254
BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS OUR TIME.

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:57.221
SO FINISH UP YOUR THOUGHTS

02:24:57.288 --> 02:24:58.189
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

02:24:58.256 --> 02:24:59.424
INTERRUPT YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS.

02:24:59.490 --> 02:25:02.960
SO LET LET LET'S KEEP GOING I

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:05.329
SEE YOUR NOTES NOW. SO. NO I

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:07.165
MEAN THIS THIS IS THIS IS JUST

02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:10.034
WHERE, WHERE I'M, WHERE I'M

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:11.269
GOING. I'M JUST GOING TO

02:25:11.335 --> 02:25:13.237
SUMMARIZE IT BECAUSE I'M PRETTY

02:25:13.304 --> 02:25:14.305
SURE THAT HARVARD PROBABLY HAS

02:25:14.372 --> 02:25:15.506
SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL,

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:16.274
KNOWING THAT YOU'VE BEEN

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:18.843
IMPACTED BY FIRES AND ALL THESE

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:19.444
OTHER ASPECTS THAT COME INTO

02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:21.179
PLAY, BUT IT'S JUST FOR ME,

02:25:21.245 --> 02:25:22.413
IT'S STILL STICKING WITH THE

02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:24.348
EQUITY AND THE AFFORDABILITY

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:27.218
CONVERSATIONS. AND MY LAST

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:28.486
QUESTION THAT I WILL STOP HERE,

02:25:28.553 --> 02:25:30.121
THOUGH, IS GOING BACK TO AN

02:25:30.188 --> 02:25:31.355
WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU GUYS

02:25:31.422 --> 02:25:34.158
HAVE HAD AND ONCE AGAIN, STILL

02:25:34.225 --> 02:25:35.293
THE QUALIFICATIONS. BUT WHAT

02:25:35.359 --> 02:25:36.427
ACTUALLY COMES WITH THOSE

02:25:36.494 --> 02:25:37.695
PROGRAMS? ARE THERE ADDITIONAL

02:25:37.762 --> 02:25:39.163
COVERAGES TO ENSURE THAT THOSE,

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:40.264
THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:25:40.331 --> 02:25:41.799
SUCCESSFUL IN THE PROGRAM ARE

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:43.201
ABLE TO SUSTAIN? AND WHAT DO

02:25:43.267 --> 02:25:45.403
YOU THINK THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY

02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:46.771
FROM YOUR PROGRAMS TO PROBABLY

02:25:46.838 --> 02:25:48.239
REPLICATE ACROSS THE STATE? AND

02:25:48.306 --> 02:25:50.308
THAT WOULD BE MY LAST QUESTION.

02:25:50.374 --> 02:25:51.509
YEAH. OKAY. SO WE'RE A

02:25:51.576 --> 02:25:53.244
DEVELOPER OWNER, AND WE USE THE

02:25:53.311 --> 02:25:55.379
PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING MADE

02:25:55.446 --> 02:25:58.182
AVAILABLE BY THE STATE OR THE

02:25:58.249 --> 02:25:59.450
LOCALITY WHERE WE'RE WORKING,

02:25:59.517 --> 02:26:01.252
OR IN THE CASE OF TAX CREDITS

02:26:01.319 --> 02:26:03.888
AND SOME OTHER SOURCES, THE

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:05.089
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WE

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:07.258
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:08.426
ALL OF THE FUNDING PROGRAMS

02:26:08.493 --> 02:26:10.828
THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO US.

02:26:10.895 --> 02:26:12.230
WE UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT,

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:13.231
THOUGH, AND THIS IS PART OF

02:26:13.297 --> 02:26:15.399
WHAT I WAS SAYING ALSO THAT,

02:26:15.466 --> 02:26:17.802
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:26:17.869 --> 02:26:19.303
AS PEOPLE INCOME QUALIFY AND

02:26:19.370 --> 02:26:21.239
MOVE INTO A DEVELOPMENT.

02:26:21.305 --> 02:26:22.874
SOMETIMES THAT'S ALL THEY NEED.

02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:23.508
THEY JUST NEED AFFORDABLE RENT

02:26:23.574 --> 02:26:25.643
AND THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY. BUT

02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:27.411
OTHERS MAY NEED MORE SUPPORT.

02:26:27.478 --> 02:26:29.113
AND SO I DO THINK THAT SERVICES

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:30.481
AND OTHER KINDS OF SUPPORT ARE

02:26:30.548 --> 02:26:31.616
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. AND I

02:26:31.682 --> 02:26:32.383
THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:34.185
IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE HOUSING

02:26:34.252 --> 02:26:35.586
FOLKS WHO ARE TRANSITIONING

02:26:35.653 --> 02:26:39.223
FROM HOMELESSNESS OR THEY'RE

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:41.058
UNHOUSED AND THEY MAY NEED

02:26:41.125 --> 02:26:42.260
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. SO THE

02:26:42.326 --> 02:26:44.362
POINT THAT I WAS MAKING IS IT

02:26:44.428 --> 02:26:45.696
WOULD BE VERY, VERY HELPFUL FOR

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:47.231
THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT HOW WE

02:26:47.298 --> 02:26:48.432
COMBINE BOTH THE CAPITAL

02:26:48.499 --> 02:26:49.700
SOURCES THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE

02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:51.302
TO MAKE THAT HOUSING AVAILABLE

02:26:51.369 --> 02:26:53.404
IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUT ALSO

02:26:53.471 --> 02:26:55.239
THE ONGOING SUPPORT. AND, YOU

02:26:55.306 --> 02:26:57.308
KNOW, I THINK YOUR POINT IS

02:26:57.375 --> 02:26:59.010
VERY VALID THAT A LOT OF THE

02:26:59.076 --> 02:27:00.178
SUPPORT HAS COME FROM THE

02:27:00.244 --> 02:27:01.712
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BUT ARE,

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:03.447
YOU KNOW, QUESTIONABLE IN THE

02:27:03.514 --> 02:27:04.482
FUTURE, LIKE PROJECT BASED

02:27:04.549 --> 02:27:05.683
SECTION EIGHT. WE USE THAT A

02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:07.118
LOT TO SUPPORT THE TENANTS. BUT

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:09.620
IF THAT MONEY IS NOT AVAILABLE,

02:27:09.687 --> 02:27:11.556
WHAT WILL WE DO? AND I THINK

02:27:11.622 --> 02:27:13.424
THAT WE JUST NEED TO BE

02:27:13.491 --> 02:27:14.292
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THAT. THANK

02:27:14.358 --> 02:27:15.359
YOU. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ON

02:27:15.426 --> 02:27:17.962
THAT SECTION. SORRY. A LOT OF

02:27:18.029 --> 02:27:18.663
PEOPLE ARE ON THAT SECTION

02:27:18.729 --> 02:27:20.264
EIGHT LIST. THEY'VE BEEN ON IT

02:27:20.331 --> 02:27:22.767
FOR 15, 20 YEARS. 25 YEARS.

02:27:22.833 --> 02:27:23.701
YEAH. SO BEING ABLE TO EDUCATE

02:27:23.768 --> 02:27:25.336
PEOPLE A LOT MORE AND HOW THEY

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:27.205
CAN MOVE FROM SECTION EIGHT AND

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:29.340
MOVE OVER INTO HOME OWNERSHIP

02:27:29.407 --> 02:27:31.342
WOULD BE GREAT. LOOKING AT THE

02:27:31.409 --> 02:27:32.076
VOUCHER PROGRAMS AND OTHER

02:27:32.143 --> 02:27:33.778
OPTIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN UTILIZE.

02:27:33.844 --> 02:27:35.746
SO I THINK WE JUST GOT TO

02:27:35.813 --> 02:27:37.215
CONTINUE TO TALK AND WHAT WE

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:39.584
CAN DO TO MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH

02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:40.251
THE PROCESS AND HAVE THEM BE

02:27:40.318 --> 02:27:42.186
COMPLACENT AND STAYING SO WE

02:27:42.253 --> 02:27:43.354
CAN MOVE THE UNHOUSED TO HOUSE

02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:45.389
AND STILL MOVE PEOPLE ON THE

02:27:45.456 --> 02:27:47.258
PROCESS. SO THANK YOU GUYS FOR

02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:49.493
I CAN IF I CAN JUST ADD A LOT

02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:51.195
OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ASKED. AND

02:27:51.262 --> 02:27:52.296
ALSO SOME MEMBER LEE, YOU ASKED

02:27:52.363 --> 02:27:54.599
SOME QUESTIONS ON DATA, AND WE

02:27:54.665 --> 02:27:55.733
HAVE A LOT OF DATA THAT'S

02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:56.767
DISAGGREGATED BY GENDER AND

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:58.402
ETHNICITY AND THINGS LIKE THAT,

02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:59.170
AS RELATES TO LOW INCOME

02:27:59.237 --> 02:28:00.137
HOUSEHOLDS AND AFFORDABLE

02:28:00.204 --> 02:28:01.539
HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:28:01.606 --> 02:28:02.340
PRODUCTION. SO I'M HAPPY TO

02:28:02.406 --> 02:28:03.641
WORK WITH YOUR OFFICES TO GET

02:28:03.708 --> 02:28:06.244
THE DATA YOU WANT ON THAT SIDE,

02:28:06.310 --> 02:28:07.979
AS WELL AS DISTRICT LEVEL DATA

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:09.180
OR COUNTY LEVEL DATA AS WELL IF

02:28:09.247 --> 02:28:11.482
YOU NEED IT. THANK YOU. THANK

02:28:11.549 --> 02:28:15.620
YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU, MADAM

02:28:15.686 --> 02:28:16.787
CHAIR, AND THANK YOU FOR THE

02:28:16.854 --> 02:28:17.421
DISCUSSION. I MEAN, FASCINATING

02:28:17.488 --> 02:28:19.390
AND AND VERY EDUCATIONAL. AND,

02:28:19.457 --> 02:28:21.392
YOU KNOW, I DO WANT TO THANK MY

02:28:21.459 --> 02:28:22.593
COLLEAGUES FOR ASKING SUCH GOOD

02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:24.228
QUESTIONS THAT MANY OF WHICH

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:26.063
WERE ANSWERED THAT I HAD. AND I

02:28:26.130 --> 02:28:28.332
DO WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:29.533
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA FOR

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:30.901
EVERYTHING THAT SHE DID WITH

02:28:30.968 --> 02:28:32.470
SUB FIVE ACTUALLY GETTING THAT

02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:35.906
NUMBER FROM ZERO, IT WAS 0 TO

02:28:35.973 --> 02:28:37.341
$1.5 BILLION. THAT WAS REALLY

02:28:37.408 --> 02:28:39.443
HERCULEAN EFFORT. AND THAT WAS

02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:41.245
I THINK THAT WILL WE WILL LOOK

02:28:41.312 --> 02:28:43.347
BACK ON THAT AND THAT'LL GO

02:28:43.414 --> 02:28:44.315
DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS

02:28:44.382 --> 02:28:46.584
BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING

02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:47.218
TO GET HOUSING BECAUSE OF THAT.

02:28:47.285 --> 02:28:49.387
AND IT'S CRAZY THAT WE HAD THAT

02:28:49.453 --> 02:28:50.921
FIGHT INTERNALLY BETWEEN THE

02:28:50.988 --> 02:28:52.356
EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATIVE

02:28:52.423 --> 02:28:53.891
BRANCHES. AND THAT KIND OF

02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:55.359
SHOWS YOU WHERE WE ARE. AND I

02:28:55.426 --> 02:28:57.361
WANT TO PIVOT A LITTLE BIT TO

02:28:57.428 --> 02:28:58.162
SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I MEAN, I

02:28:58.229 --> 02:29:00.197
HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.365
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY,

02:29:01.432 --> 02:29:02.300
BUT I WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON

02:29:02.366 --> 02:29:04.335
COSTS. I MEAN, THIS IS A MATH

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:06.704
PROBLEM TO ME. WE'RE TRYING TO

02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:07.338
FIGURE FIGURE OUT AFFORDABILITY

02:29:07.405 --> 02:29:09.273
WITH HOUSING. WE'RE TRYING TO

02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:10.474
BUILD IT, YOU KNOW, IN A MORE

02:29:10.541 --> 02:29:12.109
AFFORDABLE WAY AND A CHEAPER

02:29:12.176 --> 02:29:13.444
WAY. AND YET IT SEEMS LIKE

02:29:13.511 --> 02:29:15.646
WE'RE JUST CONSTANTLY BEHIND

02:29:15.713 --> 02:29:16.847
THE BALL AND CHASING, EVER

02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:18.849
GROWING AND EVER INCREASING

02:29:18.916 --> 02:29:20.151
COSTS. AND WE SEE WE SEE A

02:29:20.217 --> 02:29:23.554
COUPLE REASONS WHY THAT HAPPENS.

02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:25.489
LAND IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE

02:29:25.556 --> 02:29:29.360
AND WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ANYONE'S

02:29:29.427 --> 02:29:30.261
APPLICATION OF IDEAS OF OF HOW

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:32.296
TO DEAL WITH THAT LABOR AND

02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:34.131
BUILDING ANYTHING STICK BUILT

02:29:34.198 --> 02:29:36.267
IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, AND

02:29:36.334 --> 02:29:38.069
THERE ARE PERVERSE INCENTIVES

02:29:38.135 --> 02:29:40.237
TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING

02:29:40.304 --> 02:29:41.972
WITH TECH, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

02:29:42.039 --> 02:29:43.207
MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS, THE MORE

02:29:43.274 --> 02:29:44.375
LIGHT TECH YOU GET. AND

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:46.277
THEREFORE IT'S JUST KIND OF

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:47.478
THIS EVER. IT'S IT'S ALMOST

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:48.346
LIKE A TREADMILL UNLESS WE GET

02:29:48.412 --> 02:29:50.448
THE COSTS IN ORDER. SO WHAT CAN

02:29:50.514 --> 02:29:52.850
WE DO? AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY

02:29:52.917 --> 02:29:54.218
TALKED ABOUT COSTS. WE HAVEN'T

02:29:54.285 --> 02:29:56.721
TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO

02:29:56.787 --> 02:29:57.521
FROM A LEGISLATIVE OR

02:29:57.588 --> 02:29:59.223
REGULATORY STANDPOINT TO

02:29:59.290 --> 02:30:00.524
ACTUALLY KEEP COSTS DOWN. I

02:30:00.591 --> 02:30:02.259
HAVE A FEW IDEAS, BUT I'M NOT

02:30:02.326 --> 02:30:04.395
AN EXPERT. YOU GUYS ARE. WHAT

02:30:04.462 --> 02:30:06.464
CAN WE DO TO FIGURE OUT THAT

02:30:06.530 --> 02:30:07.665
SIDE OF THE LEDGER? WE'RE

02:30:07.732 --> 02:30:08.466
EVERYTHING WE'VE HEARD TODAY.

02:30:08.532 --> 02:30:09.667
EVERYTHING WE DISCUSSED ABOUT

02:30:09.734 --> 02:30:11.202
IS COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE END

02:30:11.268 --> 02:30:13.304
OF THE SPECTRUM, WHICH IS PUMP

02:30:13.371 --> 02:30:14.171
MORE MONEY IN BECAUSE

02:30:14.238 --> 02:30:16.140
EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE. WELL,

02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:17.375
HOW DO WE MAKE IT MORE

02:30:17.441 --> 02:30:19.076
AFFORDABLE? HOW DO WE MAKE LAND

02:30:19.143 --> 02:30:20.311
MORE AFFORDABLE? HOW DO WE MAKE

02:30:20.378 --> 02:30:22.146
LABOR AND BUILDING MORE

02:30:22.213 --> 02:30:23.180
AFFORDABLE? THE MARKET RATE

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:25.282
PANEL I HAVE OTHER, OTHER

02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:26.484
ISSUES. I'LL TALK TO THEM ABOUT

02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:28.052
THAT. BUT CAN SOMEONE CAN

02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:29.253
SOMEONE THROW OUT SOME IDEAS

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:31.655
THAT WE CAN PURSUE? BECAUSE

02:30:31.722 --> 02:30:32.256
EVERY TIME YOU UPZONE, EVERY

02:30:32.323 --> 02:30:34.492
TIME YOU MAKE IT LESS

02:30:34.558 --> 02:30:35.359
REGULATORY BURDENSOME, GUESS

02:30:35.426 --> 02:30:37.228
WHAT? ALL THE STUDIES AND ALL

02:30:37.294 --> 02:30:39.196
THE ALL THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

02:30:39.263 --> 02:30:40.998
COSTS JUST CONTINUE TO GO UP.

02:30:41.065 --> 02:30:42.700
YOU MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD

02:30:42.767 --> 02:30:43.434
MULTI-UNIT, YOU KNOW, HOUSING

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:46.203
ON A R1 PIECE OF PROPERTY. THAT

02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:47.705
PIECE OF PROPERTY GOES UP THREE

02:30:47.772 --> 02:30:49.540
X. THAT'S A PROBLEM. IT MAKES

02:30:49.607 --> 02:30:51.175
IT HARDER TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

02:30:51.242 --> 02:30:52.443
HOUSING, EVEN IF YOU'RE UP

02:30:52.510 --> 02:30:54.412
ZONING, BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING

02:30:54.478 --> 02:30:56.213
DIRT IS JUST SO EXPENSIVE. SO I

02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:58.048
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE

02:30:58.115 --> 02:30:58.582
THAT OUT. OBVIOUSLY, FOR

02:30:58.649 --> 02:30:59.517
DECADES. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

02:30:59.583 --> 02:31:01.485
TO FIGURE THAT OUT. WHAT DO WE

02:31:01.552 --> 02:31:04.221
DO? I CAN'T ANSWER ALL OF THOSE

02:31:04.288 --> 02:31:06.257
QUESTIONS, BUT I DO WANT TO

02:31:06.323 --> 02:31:07.558
JUST ALSO, SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP

02:31:07.625 --> 02:31:09.260
LIGHT TECH, I DO WANT TO KIND

02:31:09.326 --> 02:31:10.361
OF HIGHLIGHT THAT IN OUR

02:31:10.428 --> 02:31:12.329
PROGRAM, WE DO HAVE A COST

02:31:12.396 --> 02:31:13.531
EFFICIENCY METRIC, AND OUR

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:14.265
TIEBREAKER REALLY DOES

02:31:14.331 --> 02:31:16.367
PRIORITIZE EFFICIENCY OF

02:31:16.434 --> 02:31:20.371
RESOURCES. SO THERE IS A REAL

02:31:20.438 --> 02:31:22.173
INCENTIVE FOR THE DEVELOPERS TO

02:31:22.239 --> 02:31:24.308
KEEP THE COSTS AS LOW AS

02:31:24.375 --> 02:31:26.177
POSSIBLE. AND BUT ALSO ON THE

02:31:26.243 --> 02:31:27.278
SECOND SIDE AND AND CAN

02:31:27.344 --> 02:31:29.313
PROBABLY SPEAK TO THIS MORE. WE

02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:31.382
ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR HIGH

02:31:31.449 --> 02:31:34.318
QUALITY RENTAL HOUSING TO BE

02:31:34.385 --> 02:31:35.219
BUILT. AND A LOT OF THESE

02:31:35.286 --> 02:31:37.588
PROJECTS ARE NOT GETTING

02:31:37.655 --> 02:31:38.289
RECAPITALIZED UNTIL 20 YEARS,

02:31:38.355 --> 02:31:40.191
25 YEARS, IN SOME CASES

02:31:40.257 --> 02:31:42.493
SOMETIMES LONGER. SO YOU NEED A

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:44.295
YOU NEED TO INVEST IN THE HIGH

02:31:44.361 --> 02:31:46.297
QUALITY BUILDINGS SO THAT

02:31:46.363 --> 02:31:47.431
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO GET

02:31:47.498 --> 02:31:49.433
ANOTHER INFLUX OF DOLLARS TO

02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:51.936
REHAB THESE BUILDINGS AS

02:31:52.002 --> 02:31:53.103
FREQUENTLY AS MARKET RATE

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:55.339
HOUSING MIGHT DO, SO THAT THAT

02:31:55.406 --> 02:31:57.374
IS GOING TO BE A COMPONENT TO

02:31:57.441 --> 02:31:59.376
WHY THERE'S AN ANDREWS SLIDE.

02:31:59.443 --> 02:32:00.544
THERE'S A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE

02:32:00.611 --> 02:32:03.347
PERHAPS IN IN COST. BUT AGAIN,

02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:05.349
OUR PROGRAM, THE BOND PROGRAM

02:32:05.416 --> 02:32:07.151
REALLY DOES LOOK, THE

02:32:07.218 --> 02:32:09.687
TIEBREAKER IS FULLY BASED ON A

02:32:09.753 --> 02:32:13.991
RATIO OF RESOURCES BEING ASKED

02:32:14.058 --> 02:32:16.694
FOR. AND WHAT'S BEING WHAT'S

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:20.197
BEING PRODUCED. YEAH, I THINK

02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:21.532
YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'VE BEEN

02:32:21.599 --> 02:32:23.300
TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR DECADES

02:32:23.367 --> 02:32:24.301
TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. I

02:32:24.368 --> 02:32:26.170
WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE THAT

02:32:26.237 --> 02:32:27.471
WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE IT RIGHT

02:32:27.538 --> 02:32:29.106
HERE, RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:30.207
THAT THE QUESTION NEEDS TO BE

02:32:30.274 --> 02:32:32.343
ASKED. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:32:32.409 --> 02:32:33.177
IMPORTANT. AND I THINK THAT A

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:36.347
LOT OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN HAS MADE

02:32:36.413 --> 02:32:37.481
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME

02:32:37.548 --> 02:32:39.316
PROGRESS. I MENTIONED IN MY

02:32:39.383 --> 02:32:40.451
REMARKS THAT, YOU KNOW, LAND

02:32:40.518 --> 02:32:42.086
LEASES AND HAVING, YOU KNOW,

02:32:42.152 --> 02:32:43.387
PUBLIC LAND AVAILABLE INSTEAD

02:32:43.454 --> 02:32:46.557
OF SPENDING 10 OR 15 MILLION AN

02:32:46.624 --> 02:32:48.392
ACRE. WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, LOW

02:32:48.459 --> 02:32:50.794
COST LAND LEASES. AND I THINK

02:32:50.861 --> 02:32:51.428
THAT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

02:32:51.495 --> 02:32:53.264
I DO THINK THAT, AGAIN, THE

02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:54.498
ENTITLEMENT PATHWAY THAT WE

02:32:54.565 --> 02:32:57.601
USED TO PURSUE COST MILLIONS OR

02:32:57.668 --> 02:32:59.470
MORE DOLLARS, AND THAT IS NOW

02:32:59.537 --> 02:33:01.338
VERY, VERY EFFICIENT. SO I

02:33:01.405 --> 02:33:03.641
THINK WE'VE STARTED ATTACKING

02:33:03.707 --> 02:33:06.210
ALL OF THE COST, THE COST OF

02:33:06.277 --> 02:33:07.478
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TRYING

02:33:07.545 --> 02:33:09.613
TO DO WHAT WE CAN. AND WITH ALL

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:11.348
OF THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE LAWS

02:33:11.415 --> 02:33:13.183
AND ALL OF THAT IS VERY, VERY

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:15.219
HELPFUL. I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:16.921
ARE INCENTIVE NOT JUST BECAUSE

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:18.656
OF THE PROGRAMS, BUT JUST

02:33:18.722 --> 02:33:21.325
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER IF IT COSTS

02:33:21.392 --> 02:33:23.060
LESS MONEY. WE DON'T NEED AS

02:33:23.127 --> 02:33:24.328
MANY CAPITAL SOURCES. IT'S JUST

02:33:24.395 --> 02:33:26.330
EASIER IF IT COSTS LESS MONEY.

02:33:26.397 --> 02:33:27.298
SO WE HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO

02:33:27.364 --> 02:33:29.700
BRING THE COST DOWN. BUT THERE

02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:30.367
ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE

02:33:30.434 --> 02:33:32.069
DON'T CONTROL COST OF CAPITAL,

02:33:32.136 --> 02:33:32.636
THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION. I

02:33:32.703 --> 02:33:34.438
MEAN, WE WOULD LOVE TO SAY WE

02:33:34.505 --> 02:33:36.140
WOULD LIKE TO BUILD THAT OR BUY

02:33:36.206 --> 02:33:37.408
THAT LUMBER FOR LESS MONEY

02:33:37.474 --> 02:33:38.609
BECAUSE IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:40.511
BUT THE COST OF LUMBER IS THE

02:33:40.578 --> 02:33:41.378
COST OF LUMBER. AND WE'RE

02:33:41.445 --> 02:33:42.546
STARTING TO FEEL TARIFFS AND

02:33:42.613 --> 02:33:44.949
EVERYTHING ELSE JUST THE SAME

02:33:45.015 --> 02:33:45.583
WAY. YOU'LL HEAR PROBABLY MORE

02:33:45.649 --> 02:33:46.417
OF THIS FROM THE MARKET RATE

02:33:46.483 --> 02:33:48.352
PANEL AS WELL. I THINK THAT,

02:33:48.419 --> 02:33:49.253
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE THINGS TO

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:51.155
EXPLORE. WHEN I MENTIONED THE

02:33:51.221 --> 02:33:52.389
COST OF CAPITAL, PERHAPS

02:33:52.456 --> 02:33:53.257
THERE'S AN INTEREST RATE RIGHT

02:33:53.324 --> 02:33:55.192
DOWN, OR THERE'S A PROGRAM THAT

02:33:55.259 --> 02:33:56.427
EXISTS IN ANOTHER STATE WHERE

02:33:56.493 --> 02:33:58.462
THEY HAVE THEY USE THEIR STATE

02:33:58.529 --> 02:34:00.164
CREDITS TO WRITE DOWN THE

02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:01.398
INTEREST RATE ON PERMANENT

02:34:01.465 --> 02:34:03.434
LOANS. FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:04.835
USED TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT DID

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:06.904
THAT. SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.

02:34:06.971 --> 02:34:09.773
THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, PERHAPS

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:13.143
YOUR I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A

02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:14.378
GOOD IDEA OR NOT, BUT I'LL SAY

02:34:14.445 --> 02:34:16.780
IT OUT LOUD. YOU KNOW, MAYBE

02:34:16.847 --> 02:34:17.681
YOU'RE STANDING UP MORE MODULAR

02:34:17.748 --> 02:34:19.283
FACTORIES. THE MORE MODULAR

02:34:19.350 --> 02:34:20.417
FACTORIES THERE ARE, THE MORE

02:34:20.484 --> 02:34:23.153
COMPETITION, THE MORE, YOU KNOW,

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:24.388
EASILY ACCESSIBLE THOSE MODS

02:34:24.455 --> 02:34:26.023
ARE. AND MAYBE THAT'S GOING TO

02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:27.358
RESULT IN MORE ADOPTION AND

02:34:27.424 --> 02:34:29.326
MORE USE OF THE MODULAR

02:34:29.393 --> 02:34:30.527
FACTORIES AND MODULAR APPROACH.

02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:32.363
I JUST THINK IF WE CONTINUE

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:34.164
THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO BRING

02:34:34.231 --> 02:34:36.200
THE COST DOWN, MAYBE WE'LL MAKE

02:34:36.266 --> 02:34:37.334
SOME PROGRESS. BUT I IT'S

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:39.370
HARDER THAN IT SEEMS BECAUSE

02:34:39.436 --> 02:34:42.406
MOST OF WHAT'S IN THE COST OF

02:34:42.473 --> 02:34:44.241
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS IS MADE

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:48.078
UP OF, YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT WE

02:34:48.145 --> 02:34:49.213
JUST CAN'T CONTROL. I, I'M

02:34:49.279 --> 02:34:51.448
GOING TO HAND IT BACK OVER TO

02:34:51.515 --> 02:34:53.050
YOU, BUT I APPRECIATE THAT. AND

02:34:53.117 --> 02:34:54.351
I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD PUT

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:56.286
THIS INTO CONTEXT. WHILE WE'RE

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:57.121
CUTTING 44% OF SECTION EIGHT

02:34:57.187 --> 02:34:58.656
HOUSING, OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:34:58.722 --> 02:35:00.491
JUST PUT $9 BILLION INTO COMMON

02:35:00.557 --> 02:35:02.493
STOCK OF INTEL, RIGHT? WE WE

02:35:02.559 --> 02:35:03.327
FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THROWING

02:35:03.394 --> 02:35:05.295
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO

02:35:05.362 --> 02:35:06.530
CORPORATE WELFARE FOR VARIOUS

02:35:06.597 --> 02:35:08.232
REASONS. AND I'M NOT SAYING

02:35:08.298 --> 02:35:09.333
THAT'S NECESSARILY A BAD THING

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:11.135
OR A GOOD THING, BUT ALL THOSE

02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:12.336
THINGS THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED,

02:35:12.403 --> 02:35:13.570
WHETHER IT BE ARTIFICIALLY

02:35:13.637 --> 02:35:15.606
KEEPING THE COSTS OF LUMBER

02:35:15.673 --> 02:35:18.308
DOWN AND WE COULD DO THAT, WE

02:35:18.375 --> 02:35:19.243
COULD JUST BY THE GOVERNMENT

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:20.377
COULD JUST SPEND MONEY ON THAT.

02:35:20.444 --> 02:35:22.279
THE GOVERNMENT COULD BUY THE

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:23.213
LAND AND JUST GIVE IT TO YOU

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:25.349
FOR A DOLLAR. WE COULD DO A LOT

02:35:25.416 --> 02:35:27.251
OF THIS STUFF. AND OUR

02:35:27.317 --> 02:35:28.485
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE ALL THIS

02:35:28.552 --> 02:35:29.286
STUFF IN DIFFERENT SPACES. WE

02:35:29.353 --> 02:35:31.288
HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH OF IT IN

02:35:31.355 --> 02:35:32.389
HOUSING. SO I APPRECIATE THAT

02:35:32.456 --> 02:35:33.223
FEEDBACK AND THOSE IDEAS,

02:35:33.290 --> 02:35:34.391
BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE THE

02:35:34.458 --> 02:35:36.393
TYPES OF IDEAS THAT I KNOW

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:37.294
PLENTY OF PEOPLE ON THIS DAIS

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:39.697
ARE VERY INTERESTED IN, AND I

02:35:39.763 --> 02:35:41.465
LOOK FORWARD TO EXPLORING THAT

02:35:41.532 --> 02:35:42.566
WITH YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM

02:35:42.633 --> 02:35:46.336
CHAIR. THANK YOU. I KNOW WE'RE

02:35:46.403 --> 02:35:48.205
HEADING IN. WE HAVE ANOTHER

02:35:48.272 --> 02:35:49.540
PANEL, BUT I THINK JUST TO

02:35:49.606 --> 02:35:51.341
RECAP THIS CONVERSATION, YOU

02:35:51.408 --> 02:35:53.310
KNOW, YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY WAS

02:35:53.377 --> 02:35:55.512
VERY HELPFUL. AND I THINK IN

02:35:55.579 --> 02:35:57.181
TRYING TO STEER WHERE WE'RE

02:35:57.247 --> 02:35:59.316
GOING TO GO AND WHAT OUR VISION

02:35:59.383 --> 02:36:01.085
HERE IS THAT WE TRY TO HONE IN

02:36:01.151 --> 02:36:03.287
TO SPECIFIC AREAS TO, AS MY

02:36:03.353 --> 02:36:04.321
COLLEAGUE STATED, WE WE HAVE TO

02:36:04.388 --> 02:36:06.356
SOLVE FOR THAT X OF WHERE IS

02:36:06.423 --> 02:36:08.625
THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM

02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:10.160
AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE IT

02:36:10.227 --> 02:36:11.328
MORE AFFORDABLE. AND MY

02:36:11.395 --> 02:36:14.331
COLLEAGUE SHARON QUIRK-SILVA,

02:36:14.398 --> 02:36:16.467
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE ADU SPACE

02:36:16.533 --> 02:36:18.302
IS A SPACE IN THE FINANCING

02:36:18.368 --> 02:36:20.170
AREA BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD IT

02:36:20.237 --> 02:36:22.306
AS LEGISLATORS FROM THE BANKING

02:36:22.372 --> 02:36:23.507
COMMUNITY, AN INTEREST OUT

02:36:23.574 --> 02:36:25.342
THERE OF HOW WE LEVERAGE PUBLIC

02:36:25.409 --> 02:36:28.278
AND PRIVATE FUNDS TO STREAMLINE

02:36:28.345 --> 02:36:30.781
THAT PROCESS, THAT CAN, AS WE

02:36:30.848 --> 02:36:32.516
SAW AT CALHFA, HOW MANY

02:36:32.583 --> 02:36:34.218
APPLICATIONS CAME THROUGH AND

02:36:34.284 --> 02:36:36.086
THERE WAS FUNDING FOR THAT. SO

02:36:36.153 --> 02:36:38.155
I THINK THERE'S LOW HANGING

02:36:38.222 --> 02:36:40.290
FRUIT GOALS AND THEN THE HIGH

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:41.592
HANGING FRUIT. BUT BEING

02:36:41.658 --> 02:36:43.560
THOUGHTFUL AND STRATEGIC OF HOW

02:36:43.627 --> 02:36:45.262
WE CAN ARTICULATE AND PUT A

02:36:45.329 --> 02:36:47.664
PROPOSAL TOGETHER THAT WE CAN

02:36:47.731 --> 02:36:49.299
EXECUTE. AND IN THE HOUSING

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:50.300
COMMITTEE, I KNOW WE TALKED

02:36:50.367 --> 02:36:52.336
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, OVER THE LAST

02:36:52.402 --> 02:36:54.138
FEW YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN OVER

02:36:54.204 --> 02:36:56.340
100 HOUSING BILLS THAT HAVE

02:36:56.406 --> 02:36:58.308
HAPPENED. WHICH OF THOSE BILLS

02:36:58.375 --> 02:36:59.243
ARE WORKING AND WHICH ONES ARE

02:36:59.309 --> 02:37:01.812
NOT WORKING, SO THAT WE'RE NOT

02:37:01.879 --> 02:37:03.313
DUPLICATING OR CREATING SIMILAR

02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:05.315
TYPE. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:37:05.382 --> 02:37:07.384
AN AREA OF ANALYSIS IN THAT AS

02:37:07.451 --> 02:37:09.219
WELL, AND AN INVESTMENT IN THAT,

02:37:09.286 --> 02:37:10.454
BECAUSE WE CAN'T KEEP RUNNING

02:37:10.521 --> 02:37:12.055
BILLS IF WE'RE NOT

02:37:12.122 --> 02:37:13.257
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ONES ON

02:37:13.323 --> 02:37:15.259
THE BOOKS ARE DOING AND IF

02:37:15.325 --> 02:37:17.161
THEY'RE BEING IMPACTFUL AND

02:37:17.227 --> 02:37:22.166
EFFECTIVE. SO I THINK AND I

02:37:22.232 --> 02:37:24.701
THINK ANOTHER SPACE THAT I

02:37:24.768 --> 02:37:25.769
WOULD LIKE THIS GROUP TO

02:37:25.836 --> 02:37:27.271
CONTINUE IS THE REDEVELOPMENT

02:37:27.337 --> 02:37:29.840
2.0. I KNOW THE R WORD SCARES

02:37:29.907 --> 02:37:31.475
SOME PEOPLE, BUT I DON'T KNOW

02:37:31.542 --> 02:37:33.343
WHAT ELSE TO CALL IT OTHER THAN

02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:35.612
A 2.0 SOMETHING. BUT I DO THINK

02:37:35.679 --> 02:37:38.348
WE WE NEED TO RETHINK THAT TO

02:37:38.415 --> 02:37:39.716
THE OVERALL BIG PICTURE THAT

02:37:39.783 --> 02:37:41.552
MANY OF US ARE TALKING ABOUT IS

02:37:41.618 --> 02:37:43.487
AN OVERALL STATEWIDE HOUSING

02:37:43.554 --> 02:37:44.688
BOND, BUT THERE ISN'T GOING TO

02:37:44.755 --> 02:37:47.324
BE PALETTE FOR A BOND FOR

02:37:47.391 --> 02:37:49.059
PEOPLE WHEN AFFORDABILITY RIGHT

02:37:49.126 --> 02:37:51.528
NOW, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE AREN'T

02:37:51.595 --> 02:37:54.131
SEEING THE BENEFIT BECAUSE OF

02:37:54.198 --> 02:37:55.465
OTHER BONDS THAT HAVE HAPPENED.

02:37:55.532 --> 02:37:57.134
AND SO WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME

02:37:57.201 --> 02:37:59.436
SHORT TERM WINS TO GARNER THAT

02:37:59.503 --> 02:38:01.405
SUPPORT TO PASSING A BOND IN

02:38:01.471 --> 02:38:03.407
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS MY

02:38:03.473 --> 02:38:05.342
HUMBLE OPINION, AND I DON'T

02:38:05.409 --> 02:38:07.110
THINK ROLLING OUT WITH A BOND,

02:38:07.177 --> 02:38:08.345
THROWING EVERYTHING THAT WE ALL

02:38:08.412 --> 02:38:10.280
HAVE OUR WISH LIST OF WOULD

02:38:10.347 --> 02:38:11.281
PASS IN THIS MOMENT. GIVEN THAT

02:38:11.348 --> 02:38:13.317
WE ARE IN CRISIS MODE, I THINK

02:38:13.383 --> 02:38:15.319
WE WE NEED TO BE VERY

02:38:15.385 --> 02:38:17.120
DELIBERATE ON WHAT WE PICK TO

02:38:17.187 --> 02:38:19.756
SHOW THAT WE MADE A CHANGE OR

02:38:19.823 --> 02:38:21.191
AN IMPACT IN COMMUNITIES. AND I

02:38:21.258 --> 02:38:23.727
REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE

02:38:23.794 --> 02:38:25.329
ADU PATH, BECAUSE WE CAN PICK

02:38:25.395 --> 02:38:27.431
UP SO MANY PARTNERS AND BRING

02:38:27.497 --> 02:38:29.633
SO MANY UNITS ONLINE BECAUSE OF

02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:30.334
STREAMLINED PERMITTING, THAT

02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:32.736
HAS HAPPENED. ANOTHER SPACE

02:38:32.803 --> 02:38:34.671
THAT'S VERY COMPLICATED AS WELL

02:38:34.738 --> 02:38:38.108
IS REHAB LOANS THAT HAVE JUST

02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:40.677
DISAPPEARED. THERE'S SO MANY

02:38:40.744 --> 02:38:42.980
EMPTY NESTERS THAT CAN DOWNSIZE

02:38:43.046 --> 02:38:45.315
THAT THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO MOVE.

02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:46.383
IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE FOR THEM TO

02:38:46.450 --> 02:38:48.619
LEAVE THEIR BIG HOME TO. FREED

02:38:48.685 --> 02:38:51.054
UP FOR SINGLE FAMILY. SO THAT'S

02:38:51.121 --> 02:38:52.656
ANOTHER SPACE THAT ALSO NEEDS

02:38:52.723 --> 02:38:55.025
POLICY ANALYSIS ON ON HOW WE

02:38:55.092 --> 02:38:56.260
CAN FREE UP THOSE HOME AND THE

02:38:56.326 --> 02:38:58.595
FINANCING. AND THEN ON THE

02:38:58.662 --> 02:39:00.497
CONSTRUCTION SIDE OF, YOU KNOW,

02:39:00.564 --> 02:39:01.632
THESE PUBLIC PRIVATE

02:39:01.698 --> 02:39:03.367
PARTNERSHIPS OF MAKING THE LAND

02:39:03.433 --> 02:39:07.170
TO YOUR POINT THAT WHERE IS THE

02:39:07.237 --> 02:39:08.906
MASTER PLAN OF WHERE ALL THE

02:39:08.972 --> 02:39:11.074
STATE PARCELS ARE THAT WE COULD

02:39:11.141 --> 02:39:13.410
PUT OUT TO DEVELOPERS? WHERE IS

02:39:13.477 --> 02:39:16.680
THE MASTER PLAN IN SURPLUS

02:39:16.747 --> 02:39:18.315
PROPERTY WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:39:18.382 --> 02:39:20.317
AND THEN CREATING THE FINANCING.

02:39:20.384 --> 02:39:22.352
SO I THINK BEING STRATEGIC, IF

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:24.321
WE ARE ABLE THROUGH THIS

02:39:24.388 --> 02:39:26.423
COMMITTEE TO AT LEAST CREATE A

02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:28.592
ROADMAP OF, YOU KNOW, FIGURING

02:39:28.659 --> 02:39:30.394
OUT WHERE THE SURPLUS PROPERTY

02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:32.629
IS, BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S NOT

02:39:32.696 --> 02:39:34.665
HALF THE BATTLE IN THE

02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:37.067
FINANCING, BUT ASSETS THAT WE

02:39:37.134 --> 02:39:39.536
ALREADY OWN AND BETTER LEVERAGE

02:39:39.603 --> 02:39:42.139
TO FINANCE WILL HELP THOSE

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:44.007
PERFORMERS. AS WE ALL KNOW,

02:39:44.074 --> 02:39:46.109
INSTEAD OF ACQUIRING LAND. AND

02:39:46.176 --> 02:39:48.211
THEN SECOND TO THAT IS ALSO

02:39:48.278 --> 02:39:50.347
THOSE OF US WHO OWN LAND

02:39:50.414 --> 02:39:52.182
ALREADY ON THE SINGLE FAMILY

02:39:52.249 --> 02:39:54.351
SIDE THAT CAN LEVERAGE AND

02:39:54.418 --> 02:39:56.486
MAXIMIZE DENSITY THERE WITH

02:39:56.553 --> 02:39:58.722
ADUS. HOW CAN WE HELP THOSE

02:39:58.789 --> 02:40:00.157
INDIVIDUALS FINANCE? AND AS MY

02:40:00.223 --> 02:40:03.360
COLLEAGUE STATED, IT DOES NOT

02:40:03.427 --> 02:40:05.195
MAKE SENSE. MANY PEOPLE ARE

02:40:05.262 --> 02:40:06.330
BENEFICIARIES TO VERY LOW

02:40:06.396 --> 02:40:08.098
INTEREST RATES RIGHT NOW. TO

02:40:08.165 --> 02:40:10.300
TAP INTO YOUR EQUITY IS LEAVING

02:40:10.367 --> 02:40:11.668
THAT LOW INTEREST LOAN TO

02:40:11.735 --> 02:40:13.503
FINANCE. AND SO WE NEED A

02:40:13.570 --> 02:40:16.340
STANDALONE ADU LOAN THAT ALLOWS

02:40:16.406 --> 02:40:18.642
PEOPLE TO JUST FINANCE IT AND

02:40:18.709 --> 02:40:20.644
BRING THE INVENTORY AND FIGURE

02:40:20.711 --> 02:40:23.180
THIS OUT LEGALLY. HOW, YOU KNOW,

02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:25.449
BANKS CAN BE IN A SPACE THAT

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:27.184
THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE NOT BEING

02:40:27.250 --> 02:40:29.319
IN SECOND POSITION OF THAT, YOU

02:40:29.386 --> 02:40:31.455
KNOW, PROMISSORY NOTE AND

02:40:31.521 --> 02:40:33.256
FIGURING THIS OUT. SO I THINK

02:40:33.323 --> 02:40:35.993
THERE'S A LOT OF DIALOG THAT WE

02:40:36.059 --> 02:40:37.227
CAN HAVE IN THOSE SPACES,

02:40:37.294 --> 02:40:40.430
FIGURING OUT EXISTING BILLS,

02:40:40.497 --> 02:40:42.165
FINANCING AND LEVERAGING OUR

02:40:42.232 --> 02:40:43.500
ASSETS THAT THE STATE HAS,

02:40:43.567 --> 02:40:45.068
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE

02:40:45.135 --> 02:40:47.270
CONTROL OF AND FIGURING OUT HOW

02:40:47.337 --> 02:40:48.972
WE MATCH UP THAT SURPLUS LAND

02:40:49.039 --> 02:40:51.241
TO DEVELOPERS AND THEN TO

02:40:51.308 --> 02:40:53.510
FINANCING TO OVERALL, THE BIG

02:40:53.577 --> 02:40:56.346
PICTURE OF A STATEWIDE BOND.

02:40:56.413 --> 02:40:58.048
BUT I THINK THIS COMMITTEE

02:40:58.115 --> 02:41:00.217
SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

02:41:00.283 --> 02:41:01.718
REDEVELOPMENT AND WHAT THAT

02:41:01.785 --> 02:41:03.086
LOOKS LIKE, OR A VERSION OF IT,

02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:05.422
A TWO POINT SOMETHING, BECAUSE

02:41:05.489 --> 02:41:07.991
LIKE I SAID, PEOPLE'S EARS TURN

02:41:08.058 --> 02:41:08.525
OFF WHEN WE START SAYING

02:41:08.592 --> 02:41:12.162
REDEVELOPMENT. ON THAT NOTE, I

02:41:12.229 --> 02:41:14.498
WANT TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES ON

02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:16.233
THE PANEL IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY

02:41:16.299 --> 02:41:19.269
OTHER FOLLOW UP, OR I'D LIKE TO

02:41:19.336 --> 02:41:20.570
DEPART WITH JUST NEXT STEPS,

02:41:20.637 --> 02:41:22.172
EVEN FOR YOU GUYS. IS THAT

02:41:22.239 --> 02:41:23.473
SOUND? IF ANY OF THE THINGS

02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:25.042
THAT WE ALL THREW OUT, WHERE

02:41:25.108 --> 02:41:26.176
WHERE SHOULD WE GO NEXT?

02:41:26.243 --> 02:41:27.811
BECAUSE I REALLY DO FEEL THAT

02:41:27.878 --> 02:41:29.379
THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ONGOING

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:30.347
WORKING GROUP, WHETHER IN THE

02:41:30.414 --> 02:41:32.282
PUBLIC FORUM OR A SUBGROUP OF

02:41:32.349 --> 02:41:33.583
JUST US COMING BACK AND SPACES

02:41:33.650 --> 02:41:36.186
TO TALK ABOUT IN ORDER. IF IF

02:41:36.253 --> 02:41:37.387
WE'RE AMBITIOUS ENOUGH TO HAVE

02:41:37.454 --> 02:41:40.190
A PROPOSAL TO OUR COLLEAGUES BY

02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:41.324
JANUARY, WE NEED TO MEET

02:41:41.391 --> 02:41:43.427
REGULARLY TO HAVE A DIRECTION.

02:41:43.493 --> 02:41:45.429
SO I'M LOOKING TO MY COMMITTEE

02:41:45.495 --> 02:41:49.132
MEMBERS ON AND IN THE GROUP AS

02:41:49.199 --> 02:41:52.035
WELL. WHAT WHAT WE ALL SAID,

02:41:52.102 --> 02:41:53.136
WHERE WOULD YOU ALL LIKE TO

02:41:53.203 --> 02:41:57.174
LEAN INTO? WELL, I JUST WANT TO

02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:59.876
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:41:59.943 --> 02:42:01.411
CONVERSATION. I THINK THERE'S

02:42:01.478 --> 02:42:04.414
SOME EXISTING BODY OF WORK ON

02:42:04.481 --> 02:42:06.349
ADUS THAT WE COULD BUILD UPON,

02:42:06.416 --> 02:42:08.585
SO WE WOULD LOVE TO BRING THAT

02:42:08.652 --> 02:42:09.653
BACK FOR FURTHER EXPLORATION. I

02:42:09.719 --> 02:42:11.388
DO AGREE THAT THERE'S BEEN A

02:42:11.455 --> 02:42:13.056
LOT OF LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY

02:42:13.123 --> 02:42:15.125
THAT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY FRUITFUL,

02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:17.260
AND I LOVE THE IDEA OF REALLY

02:42:17.327 --> 02:42:18.295
UNDERSTANDING WHICH ONES HAVE

02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:21.331
BEEN THE MOST IMPACTFUL. AND,

02:42:21.398 --> 02:42:22.532
YOU KNOW, WOULD LOVE TO

02:42:22.599 --> 02:42:24.167
CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED WITH

02:42:24.234 --> 02:42:25.502
THAT. AND I THINK YOU HAVE THE

02:42:25.569 --> 02:42:27.471
RIGHT FOLKS, YOU KNOW, TO THINK

02:42:27.537 --> 02:42:28.171
THROUGH THAT, ESPECIALLY, YOU

02:42:28.238 --> 02:42:29.406
KNOW, STAKEHOLDERS OUT IN THE

02:42:29.473 --> 02:42:30.574
FIELD REALLY BUILDING THE

02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:33.343
PROJECTS, YOU KNOW, AND I DO

02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:35.545
THINK, YOU KNOW, STATE PRIORITY

02:42:35.612 --> 02:42:37.147
IS REALLY TO UNLOCK LAND WHERE

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:39.416
POSSIBLE. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE

02:42:39.483 --> 02:42:41.051
CAN SHARE WHAT WE'VE DONE SO

02:42:41.118 --> 02:42:43.987
FAR TO DO THAT AND KIND OF MAKE

02:42:44.054 --> 02:42:45.522
THOSE AVAILABLE AND, AND PUBLIC.

02:42:45.589 --> 02:42:47.224
BUT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S

02:42:47.290 --> 02:42:49.593
MORE TO DO ON THE PROGRAM SIDE.

02:42:49.659 --> 02:42:50.393
SO LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:53.363
ABOUT THAT. GREAT. I AGREE I

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:55.298
THINK THE CO-CHAIR IS VERY WELL

02:42:55.365 --> 02:42:57.467
AWARE OF CALHFA'S ACTIVITIES,

02:42:57.534 --> 02:42:59.536
HAVING BEEN A PART OF OUR BOARD

02:42:59.603 --> 02:43:01.304
FOR MANY YEARS, SO WE WOULD

02:43:01.371 --> 02:43:02.706
LOVE TO CONTINUE THE

02:43:02.772 --> 02:43:04.107
CONVERSATION, OBVIOUSLY, IN

02:43:04.174 --> 02:43:07.043
LAND USE AND HOW WE CAN,

02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:09.112
ESPECIALLY WITH, YOU KNOW, WE

02:43:09.179 --> 02:43:10.647
BROUGHT UP SCHOOLS AND

02:43:10.714 --> 02:43:12.382
EDUCATION ABOUT CALHFA HAS BEEN

02:43:12.449 --> 02:43:14.184
CONSIDERING LOOKING AT THAT. AS

02:43:14.251 --> 02:43:15.519
I STATED BEFORE, WE ARE LOOKING

02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:17.320
TO DIVERSIFY THE PRODUCTS WE'RE

02:43:17.387 --> 02:43:18.488
OFFERING IN THE SPACE AND

02:43:18.555 --> 02:43:19.456
CONNECTING WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

02:43:19.523 --> 02:43:22.092
COMMUNITY, KIND OF FROM A

02:43:22.159 --> 02:43:23.426
DESIGN THINKING, HUMAN CENTERED

02:43:23.493 --> 02:43:25.795
DESIGN APPROACH. SO WE CAN

02:43:25.862 --> 02:43:26.396
DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO UPDATE

02:43:26.463 --> 02:43:28.365
ON THE PROGRESS AS WE DESIGN

02:43:28.431 --> 02:43:30.867
AND AND DEPLOY MORE PRODUCTS

02:43:30.934 --> 02:43:32.569
INTO THE MULTIFAMILY SPACE AS

02:43:32.636 --> 02:43:35.505
WELL. AND ADU, WE DID WE DID

02:43:35.572 --> 02:43:38.542
HAVE A PROGRAM. WE HELPED ABOUT

02:43:38.608 --> 02:43:40.177
2500 HOMEOWNERS WITH OUR GRANT

02:43:40.243 --> 02:43:42.345
PROGRAM. BUT I THINK THAT THE

02:43:42.412 --> 02:43:43.480
CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE BIGGER

02:43:43.547 --> 02:43:46.082
THAN A GRANT PROGRAM. IT REALLY

02:43:46.149 --> 02:43:47.284
NEEDS TO BE LOOKING AT

02:43:47.350 --> 02:43:49.085
FINANCING. AND I THINK BRINGING

02:43:49.152 --> 02:43:51.388
THE PRIVATE BANKING SIDE IS

02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:54.191
SUPER CRITICAL AS WELL. I THINK

02:43:54.257 --> 02:43:55.559
IN TERMS OF REDUCING COSTS,

02:43:55.625 --> 02:43:57.460
THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT AND

02:43:57.527 --> 02:43:58.361
WILL HELP MARKET RATE AS WELL.

02:43:58.428 --> 02:44:00.430
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A HOUSING

02:44:00.497 --> 02:44:01.498
CRISIS AT MULTIPLE INCOME

02:44:01.565 --> 02:44:02.299
LEVELS, NOT JUST LOW INCOME

02:44:02.365 --> 02:44:04.234
LEVELS. AND IF WE COULD REDUCE

02:44:04.301 --> 02:44:05.402
THE COST OF BUILDING EVEN

02:44:05.468 --> 02:44:06.303
MARKET RATE, WE CAN REACH LOWER

02:44:06.369 --> 02:44:08.205
INCOME LEVELS THAT WAY VERSUS

02:44:08.271 --> 02:44:09.339
NEEDING PUBLIC SUBSIDIES. SO I

02:44:09.406 --> 02:44:10.707
THINK THAT CONVERSATION IS

02:44:10.774 --> 02:44:12.209
REALLY MUCH NEEDED. AND IN

02:44:12.275 --> 02:44:13.343
TERMS OF THE KIND OF

02:44:13.410 --> 02:44:14.511
REDEVELOPMENT 2.0, THERE'S BEEN

02:44:14.578 --> 02:44:16.146
A NUMBER OF BILLS THE LAST FEW

02:44:16.213 --> 02:44:18.248
YEARS TO TRY TO REVIVE THIS

02:44:18.315 --> 02:44:19.182
IDEA OF REDEVELOPMENT, AND A

02:44:19.249 --> 02:44:21.218
LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN PRETTY

02:44:21.284 --> 02:44:22.519
UNSUCCESSFUL. SO OPENING UP

02:44:22.586 --> 02:44:23.453
CONVERSATION OF HOW WE CAN

02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:25.255
LEARN FROM THOSE, LEARN FROM

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:27.324
THOSE BILLS AND FROM THOSE

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:28.491
FINANCING DISTRICTS AND MAKE

02:44:28.558 --> 02:44:29.259
SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY

02:44:29.326 --> 02:44:31.228
WORK. SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA.

02:44:31.294 --> 02:44:32.662
AND I THINK ANOTHER PIECE

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:34.798
THAT'S REALLY INTEGRAL TO THIS

02:44:34.864 --> 02:44:38.101
IS OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY, THE

02:44:38.168 --> 02:44:39.269
WORKFORCE THAT, YOU KNOW, I

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:41.238
THINK WE HAVE DIFFERENT

02:44:41.304 --> 02:44:43.039
PARTNERS ARRIVING NOW,

02:44:43.106 --> 02:44:45.642
CORPORATIONS THAT BUILD BIG

02:44:45.709 --> 02:44:48.144
COMMERCIAL SPACES AND HAVE, YOU

02:44:48.211 --> 02:44:49.946
KNOW, A WORKFORCE COMMUTING TWO

02:44:50.013 --> 02:44:52.515
HOURS AWAY. AND SO I THINK

02:44:52.582 --> 02:44:54.351
EXPLORING THAT SPACE, IN

02:44:54.417 --> 02:44:56.152
ADDITION TO THE SURPLUS LAND OF

02:44:56.219 --> 02:44:57.587
THE STATE MIGHT HAVE, AND

02:44:57.654 --> 02:44:59.489
WORKING WITH OUR BUSINESS

02:44:59.556 --> 02:45:00.624
COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF

02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:02.158
CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE A VESTED

02:45:02.225 --> 02:45:04.060
INTEREST. SO I THINK WE SHOULD

02:45:04.127 --> 02:45:05.028
ADD THAT AS WELL AS FUTURE

02:45:05.095 --> 02:45:08.365
DIALOG. ANYTHING ELSE? THANK

02:45:08.431 --> 02:45:09.332
YOU SO MUCH. I'M DON'T LEAVE

02:45:09.399 --> 02:45:11.501
YET BECAUSE WE HAVE PUBLIC

02:45:11.568 --> 02:45:12.435
COMMENT. SO IN CASE ANYONE I'M

02:45:12.502 --> 02:45:14.104
GOING TO CLOSE OUT OUR

02:45:14.170 --> 02:45:16.206
DISCUSSION AND BRING UP, YOU

02:45:16.273 --> 02:45:17.374
KNOW, ANYBODY FROM THE

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:18.508
COMMUNITY THAT WOULD WISH TO

02:45:18.575 --> 02:45:22.712
COMMENT ON THIS SEGMENT OF OUR

02:45:22.779 --> 02:45:33.089
DISCUSSION. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:45:33.156 --> 02:45:35.925
MARINA ESPINOSA HERE WITH THE

02:45:35.992 --> 02:45:36.693
CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM.

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:38.161
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:45:38.228 --> 02:45:40.764
DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AND ALSO

02:45:40.830 --> 02:45:42.098
APPRECIATE THE FUNDING

02:45:42.165 --> 02:45:44.200
ALLOCATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:45:44.267 --> 02:45:46.102
PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET THIS

02:45:46.169 --> 02:45:48.204
YEAR. AS THE PANELISTS NOTED,

02:45:48.271 --> 02:45:51.207
RECENT CHANGES TO FEDERAL LAW

02:45:51.274 --> 02:45:53.209
WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO

02:45:53.276 --> 02:45:54.044
LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:55.578
TO PRODUCE MORE HOUSING.

02:45:55.645 --> 02:45:58.415
HOWEVER, TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THE

02:45:58.481 --> 02:46:00.517
NEW FEDERAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE,

02:46:00.583 --> 02:46:01.418
IT'S CRITICAL THAT A HOUSING

02:46:01.484 --> 02:46:03.486
BOND BE PASSED TO PROVIDE AN

02:46:03.553 --> 02:46:04.287
ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE THAT

02:46:04.354 --> 02:46:06.389
WILL BE AVAILABLE OVER MULTIPLE

02:46:06.456 --> 02:46:08.425
YEARS, AND WE'RE WORKING WITH

02:46:08.491 --> 02:46:10.293
OUR PARTNERS ON TWO TWO

02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:11.361
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND

02:46:11.428 --> 02:46:13.129
MEASURES THIS YEAR, WHICH ARE

02:46:13.196 --> 02:46:14.431
CURRENTLY IN THE SENATE, AND WE

02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:16.333
HOPE THAT THOSE MEASURES WILL

02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:17.434
MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK.

02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:19.336
I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE

02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:20.503
HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE

02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:22.138
GOVERNOR'S REORGANIZATION PLAN

02:46:22.205 --> 02:46:24.307
CLOSELY, AND WE'RE EXCITED

02:46:24.374 --> 02:46:25.975
ABOUT HAVING A NEW HOUSING,

02:46:26.042 --> 02:46:27.344
SORRY, A NEW CABINET LEVEL

02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:29.779
AGENCY SECRETARY TO OVERSEE

02:46:29.846 --> 02:46:32.248
HOUSING. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE

02:46:32.315 --> 02:46:34.017
FACT THAT TCAC AND SEDLAK ARE

02:46:34.084 --> 02:46:36.119
NOT CAPTURED BY THE PLAN. THOSE

02:46:36.186 --> 02:46:37.654
COMMITTEES FUNCTION EXTREMELY

02:46:37.721 --> 02:46:38.088
WELL UNDER THE STATE

02:46:38.154 --> 02:46:40.223
TREASURER'S OFFICE. THANK YOU,

02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:42.826
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:46:42.892 --> 02:46:44.094
NATALIE SPIVAK WITH HOUSING

02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:45.295
CALIFORNIA. WE'RE A STATEWIDE

02:46:45.362 --> 02:46:47.263
NONPROFIT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION

02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:49.466
FOCUSED ON PRODUCING AFFORDABLE

02:46:49.532 --> 02:46:50.266
HOUSING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS.

02:46:50.333 --> 02:46:52.402
REALLY WANT TO APPRECIATE THE

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:53.536
SELECT COMMITTEE FOR YOUR HARD

02:46:53.603 --> 02:46:55.372
WORK ON THESE ISSUES. AND ALL

02:46:55.438 --> 02:46:56.906
OF THE FABULOUS PANELISTS THAT

02:46:56.973 --> 02:46:58.441
ARE HERE TODAY, YOU'VE ALREADY

02:46:58.508 --> 02:47:01.044
HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE SCALE OF

02:47:01.111 --> 02:47:02.178
THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE, FOR

02:47:02.245 --> 02:47:03.313
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO I JUST

02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:06.449
WANT TO FOCUS ON TWO IMMEDIATE

02:47:06.516 --> 02:47:07.550
OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW AND

02:47:07.617 --> 02:47:08.551
DEFEND THE STATE'S INVESTMENTS

02:47:08.618 --> 02:47:10.053
IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING,

02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:11.154
PARTICULARLY WITH THE NEW

02:47:11.221 --> 02:47:12.789
OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE

02:47:12.856 --> 02:47:14.824
FEDERAL FUNDS. FIRST, AS MARINA

02:47:14.891 --> 02:47:16.292
ESPINOSA MENTIONED, IS THE

02:47:16.359 --> 02:47:18.728
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND. THE

02:47:18.795 --> 02:47:19.496
BOND COULD HELP PRODUCE 40,000

02:47:19.562 --> 02:47:21.264
NEW UNITS AND CRITICALLY

02:47:21.331 --> 02:47:25.568
PRESERVE 5500 AFFORDABLE UNITS.

02:47:25.635 --> 02:47:27.270
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HOW

02:47:27.337 --> 02:47:28.505
IMPORTANT THE PRESERVATION SIDE

02:47:28.571 --> 02:47:30.173
OF THE EQUATION IS. WE'RE AT

02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:32.742
RISK OF LOSING ABOUT AS MANY

02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:34.177
AFFORDABLE UNITS AS WE ARE

02:47:34.244 --> 02:47:36.346
BUILDING, SO WE REALLY NEED TO

02:47:36.413 --> 02:47:37.247
BE THINKING ABOUT BOTH SIDES OF

02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:39.149
THE EQUATION. THE SECOND

02:47:39.215 --> 02:47:41.351
IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITY IS

02:47:41.418 --> 02:47:42.085
MAINTAINING THE EXISTING

02:47:42.152 --> 02:47:43.353
FUNDING FOR THE AFFORDABLE

02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:44.487
HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE

02:47:44.554 --> 02:47:46.523
COMMUNITIES PROGRAM, WHICH IS

02:47:46.589 --> 02:47:48.591
CURRENTLY AT RISK AS THE

02:47:48.658 --> 02:47:50.326
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR

02:47:50.393 --> 02:47:51.528
REVISIT THE CAP AND TRADE

02:47:51.594 --> 02:47:54.297
PROGRAM. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

02:47:54.364 --> 02:47:55.231
THAT PROGRAM AS MUCH IN THESE

02:47:55.298 --> 02:47:57.400
HALLS, BUT I THINK THAT'S

02:47:57.467 --> 02:47:58.535
ACTUALLY FOR GOOD REASON. WE

02:47:58.601 --> 02:48:00.270
GET A CONTINUOUS 20%

02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:02.205
APPROPRIATION FROM GRF EVERY

02:48:02.272 --> 02:48:04.707
YEAR. AND SO WE DON'T NEED TO

02:48:04.774 --> 02:48:05.308
REHASH THE SAME BATTLES HERE

02:48:05.375 --> 02:48:07.544
EVERY YEAR LIKE WE DO WITH THE

02:48:07.610 --> 02:48:09.245
STATE LIGHT TECH AND M-H-P

02:48:09.312 --> 02:48:12.148
PROGRAMS. AND THEN FINALLY,

02:48:12.215 --> 02:48:13.516
WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT

02:48:13.583 --> 02:48:16.319
EFFICIENCY WE DO NEED TO FUND.

02:48:16.386 --> 02:48:18.588
AND WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:48:18.655 --> 02:48:19.422
THAT WE'RE USING OUR RESOURCES

02:48:19.489 --> 02:48:21.124
AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. WE

02:48:21.191 --> 02:48:23.126
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE

02:48:23.193 --> 02:48:24.327
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE NEW

02:48:24.394 --> 02:48:27.030
AGENCY OR CHA, AND WE WILL

02:48:27.096 --> 02:48:28.498
CONTINUE TO BE AND LOOK FORWARD

02:48:28.565 --> 02:48:30.767
TO ENGAGING ON THOSE TOPICS IN

02:48:30.834 --> 02:48:34.304
THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. GOOD

02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:35.104
AFTERNOON, CO-CHAIRS AND

02:48:35.171 --> 02:48:37.140
MEMBERS. MY NAME IS PAUL

02:48:37.207 --> 02:48:38.274
SCHAEFER. I'M THE PUBLIC POLICY

02:48:38.341 --> 02:48:39.509
MANAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:48:39.576 --> 02:48:40.243
COUNCIL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:48:40.310 --> 02:48:42.178
WE REPRESENT THE FULL GAMBIT OF

02:48:42.245 --> 02:48:43.346
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:48:43.413 --> 02:48:44.747
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, FROM THE

02:48:44.814 --> 02:48:45.348
LENDERS AND TAX INDICATORS TO

02:48:45.415 --> 02:48:47.217
THE DEVELOPERS AND THE LONG

02:48:47.283 --> 02:48:48.485
TERM PROPERTY MANAGERS. I JUST

02:48:48.551 --> 02:48:50.587
WANT TO START BY THANKING THIS

02:48:50.653 --> 02:48:51.387
BODY FOR TAKING UP SUCH AN

02:48:51.454 --> 02:48:52.489
IMPORTANT TOPIC, ESPECIALLY

02:48:52.555 --> 02:48:54.090
WITH THE FOCUS ON FINANCE. I

02:48:54.157 --> 02:48:56.292
THINK THAT THAT PART OF THE

02:48:56.359 --> 02:48:57.393
CONVERSATION IS LEFT OUT. SO I

02:48:57.460 --> 02:48:59.062
THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

02:48:59.128 --> 02:49:00.396
AS WE CONTINUE, I WOULD JUST

02:49:00.463 --> 02:49:01.898
LIKE TO EXTEND OUR

02:49:01.965 --> 02:49:03.433
ORGANIZATION'S EXPERTISE AS

02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:05.168
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS MAY ARISE.

02:49:05.235 --> 02:49:07.136
WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER ANY HELP

02:49:07.203 --> 02:49:08.872
THAT WE CAN AND WE APPRECIATE

02:49:08.938 --> 02:49:09.706
THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS.

02:49:09.772 --> 02:49:13.510
THANK YOU. SO. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:49:13.576 --> 02:49:15.645
TIA BOATMAN PATTERSON. I'M THE

02:49:15.712 --> 02:49:16.479
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PRESIDENT

02:49:16.546 --> 02:49:18.615
AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:49:18.681 --> 02:49:19.082
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT

02:49:19.148 --> 02:49:21.451
CORPORATION. WE FINANCE OR

02:49:21.518 --> 02:49:24.153
PROVIDE LENDING PERMANENT

02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:25.622
LENDING FOR MULTIFAMILY

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:26.456
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, PRIMARILY

02:49:26.523 --> 02:49:30.260
9% AND 4% DEALS. I'M ALSO THE

02:49:30.326 --> 02:49:31.728
FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

02:49:31.794 --> 02:49:32.328
THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE

02:49:32.395 --> 02:49:34.664
AGENCY, AND I'M A RECOVERING

02:49:34.731 --> 02:49:37.233
REDEVELOPMENT ATTORNEY. SO I

02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:39.302
HAVE 30 YEARS OF HOUSING

02:49:39.369 --> 02:49:40.537
FINANCE EXPERIENCE. AND SO I

02:49:40.603 --> 02:49:42.372
WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR WHEN WE

02:49:42.438 --> 02:49:45.475
TALK ABOUT FINANCE. FINANCE IS

02:49:45.542 --> 02:49:47.210
GOING OUT AND GETTING MONEY

02:49:47.277 --> 02:49:48.411
FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR,

02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:50.046
BRINGING IT TO THE TABLE AND

02:49:50.113 --> 02:49:52.582
BEING ABLE TO REPAY YOUR DEBT.

02:49:52.649 --> 02:49:55.084
FUNDING IS SUBSIDY. NOW, WHAT

02:49:55.151 --> 02:49:56.419
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REALLY

02:49:56.486 --> 02:49:58.454
NEEDS TO FOCUS ON IS THE

02:49:58.521 --> 02:50:00.557
HOUSING FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT

02:50:00.623 --> 02:50:02.492
COME INTO THE CAPITAL STACK.

02:50:02.559 --> 02:50:04.394
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:06.729
OVERALL FINANCING RIGHT NOW,

02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:08.064
THE BACKBONE FOR MULTIFAMILY

02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:10.700
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE

02:50:10.767 --> 02:50:11.234
OF CALIFORNIA ARE THE TAX

02:50:11.301 --> 02:50:13.236
CREDITS. THEY'RE ONE OF THE

02:50:13.303 --> 02:50:14.203
BEST TAX CREDIT ALLOCATORS IN

02:50:14.270 --> 02:50:16.005
THE NATION. AND I CAN SAY THAT

02:50:16.072 --> 02:50:17.140
BECAUSE I USED TO BE THE

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:18.341
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL

02:50:18.408 --> 02:50:19.542
COUNCIL OF STATE HOUSING AGENCY,

02:50:19.609 --> 02:50:21.744
AND CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE

02:50:21.811 --> 02:50:23.079
BEST ALL STATES EXCEPT FOR

02:50:23.146 --> 02:50:24.514
CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS

02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:27.517
HAVE THEIR TAX CREDIT ALLOCATOR

02:50:27.584 --> 02:50:31.287
ALSO FUND THE GAP. SO YOU HAVE

02:50:31.354 --> 02:50:34.991
A ONE STOP SHOP. THE PROBLEM IN

02:50:35.058 --> 02:50:36.092
CALIFORNIA IS THAT THE FUNDING

02:50:36.159 --> 02:50:37.794
OF HOUSING PROGRAMS IS COMING

02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:40.463
OUTSIDE OF THE FINANCING SYSTEM.

02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:42.165
YOU HAVE A HOUSING FINANCE

02:50:42.231 --> 02:50:45.101
AGENCY WHICH FINANCES THEY HAVE

02:50:45.168 --> 02:50:47.971
TO TAKE ON DEBT AND IT HAS TO

02:50:48.037 --> 02:50:49.038
BE REPAID. WHAT DOES THE

02:50:49.105 --> 02:50:51.608
CALIFORNIA STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:50:51.674 --> 02:50:54.544
WANT ITS ROLE TO BE IN FUNDING

02:50:54.611 --> 02:50:56.512
HOUSING PROGRAMS? DO YOU WANT

02:50:56.579 --> 02:50:58.314
TO BE ON THE FRONT END AND DO

02:50:58.381 --> 02:51:00.283
PRE-DEVELOPMENT? DO YOU WANT TO

02:51:00.350 --> 02:51:02.118
DO ACQUISITION? DO YOU WANT TO

02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:04.253
COME IN AS GAP FINANCING? YOU

02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:06.456
CANNOT FIX THE HOUSING FINANCE

02:51:06.522 --> 02:51:08.224
SYSTEM UNTIL YOU DETERMINE WHAT

02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:10.326
YOUR ROLE IS GOING TO BE.

02:51:10.393 --> 02:51:12.462
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, ALL OF THE

02:51:12.528 --> 02:51:14.964
STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING

02:51:15.031 --> 02:51:17.166
FUNDING PROGRAMS ARE FOR PERM

02:51:17.233 --> 02:51:19.902
PIECE ON THE BACK END, BUT THEY

02:51:19.969 --> 02:51:22.372
COME IN FIRST. THAT IS

02:51:22.438 --> 02:51:25.174
BACKWARDS. YOU CAN'T COME IN

02:51:25.241 --> 02:51:27.710
AND FIRST AND APPLICANT AND DO

02:51:27.777 --> 02:51:28.344
A WHOLE COMPETITIVE APPLICATION

02:51:28.411 --> 02:51:30.179
AND BRING IN YOUR FRONT END

02:51:30.246 --> 02:51:31.514
MONDAY AND THEN SAY, WE'RE NOT

02:51:31.581 --> 02:51:33.049
GOING TO FUND THE PROJECT UNTIL

02:51:33.116 --> 02:51:34.183
THREE YEARS, AND THEN WE'RE

02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:35.251
GOING TO DICTATE THAT REAL

02:51:35.318 --> 02:51:38.087
ESTATE TRANSACTION. THAT IS THE

02:51:38.154 --> 02:51:40.323
TAIL WAGGING THE DOG INSTEAD OF

02:51:40.390 --> 02:51:43.459
THE DOG WAGGING THE TAIL. YOU

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:45.595
HAVE TO LEAD WITH THE TAX

02:51:45.662 --> 02:51:47.063
CREDITS, AND THEN THE FUNDING

02:51:47.130 --> 02:51:49.732
HAS TO WORK WITH THE TAX

02:51:49.799 --> 02:51:51.167
CREDITS, NOT THE OTHER WAY

02:51:51.234 --> 02:51:53.836
AROUND. AND CALIFORNIA HAS

02:51:53.903 --> 02:51:56.005
GOTTEN IT COMPLETELY BACKWARDS.

02:51:56.072 --> 02:51:58.374
THE REASON REDEVELOPMENT WORKED

02:51:58.441 --> 02:52:00.143
IS BECAUSE REDEVELOPMENT

02:52:00.209 --> 02:52:03.279
FUNDING CAME IN IN VARIOUS WAYS.

02:52:03.346 --> 02:52:05.048
YOU COULD BRING IT IN FOR HOME

02:52:05.114 --> 02:52:06.916
OWNERSHIP, YOU COULD BRING IN

02:52:06.983 --> 02:52:08.651
IT FOR GAP FINANCING, YOU COULD

02:52:08.718 --> 02:52:09.819
BRING IT IN FOR PRE-DEVELOPMENT.

02:52:09.886 --> 02:52:11.554
YOU COULD BRING IT IN TO

02:52:11.621 --> 02:52:14.390
LEVERAGE PRIVATE CAPITAL. RIGHT

02:52:14.457 --> 02:52:16.192
NOW, THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:52:16.259 --> 02:52:18.361
PUTTING IN THEIR MONEY AS IF

02:52:18.428 --> 02:52:20.229
IT'S LEVERAGING PRIVATE CAPITAL,

02:52:20.296 --> 02:52:22.031
AND IT'S DOING JUST THE

02:52:22.098 --> 02:52:24.100
OPPOSITE. SO YOU REALLY MUST

02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:26.335
THINK ABOUT YOUR HOUSING

02:52:26.402 --> 02:52:27.603
PROGRAMS, WHICH YOU HAVE 57

02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:30.606
MILLION OF THEM WITH ALL

02:52:30.673 --> 02:52:32.241
DIFFERENT RULES, AND HOW THAT

02:52:32.308 --> 02:52:34.444
IS GOING TO PLAY WITH THE

02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:36.179
SYSTEM, NOT CHANGE THE SYSTEM

02:52:36.245 --> 02:52:38.347
TO FIT THOSE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE

02:52:38.414 --> 02:52:40.416
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 40

02:52:40.483 --> 02:52:41.284
YEARS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:52:41.350 --> 02:52:43.252
CREATE A ONE STOP SHOP. YOU

02:52:43.319 --> 02:52:45.088
WILL NEVER CREATE A ONE STOP

02:52:45.154 --> 02:52:47.090
SHOP UNTIL YOU FLIP THE SCRIPT

02:52:47.156 --> 02:52:49.992
AND THINK ABOUT FUNDING HOUSING

02:52:50.059 --> 02:52:51.194
PROGRAMS DIFFERENTLY AND

02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:53.062
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU WANT.

02:52:53.129 --> 02:52:54.197
THE ROLE OF THE STATE OF

02:52:54.263 --> 02:52:56.165
CALIFORNIA CAN BE BECAUSE

02:52:56.232 --> 02:52:57.767
UNDERSTAND TAX CREDITS AND

02:52:57.834 --> 02:53:00.803
BONDS CAN GO FROM EVERYTHING

02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:03.106
FROM HOMELESSNESS TO ENTRY

02:53:03.172 --> 02:53:04.340
LEVEL HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND WE

02:53:04.407 --> 02:53:05.842
CAN'T JUST THINK ABOUT

02:53:05.908 --> 02:53:07.744
PRODUCTION, WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE

02:53:07.810 --> 02:53:09.278
DONE FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.

02:53:09.345 --> 02:53:11.647
WE MUST TALK ABOUT PRESERVATION.

02:53:11.714 --> 02:53:12.749
SO BALANCING WHAT THOSE NEEDS

02:53:12.815 --> 02:53:14.250
ARE GOING TO BE AND

02:53:14.317 --> 02:53:15.618
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOUR ROLE IS

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:17.353
GOING TO BE IS GOING TO BE

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:18.821
CRITICAL. AND ANYTHING YOU DO

02:53:18.888 --> 02:53:21.023
TO TALK ABOUT HOUSING FINANCE,

02:53:21.090 --> 02:53:25.595
JUST MY $0.02. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:53:25.661 --> 02:53:27.230
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M KAREN

02:53:27.296 --> 02:53:28.598
STOUT HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF

02:53:28.664 --> 02:53:30.633
OF A COUPLE OF MY CLIENTS, MOST

02:53:30.700 --> 02:53:31.567
NOTABLY CALIFORNIA YIMBY AS

02:53:31.634 --> 02:53:33.369
WELL AS UNIDOSUS. JUST WANTED

02:53:33.436 --> 02:53:34.504
TO ECHO EVERYBODY ELSE'S

02:53:34.570 --> 02:53:35.605
COMMENTS. I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:53:35.671 --> 02:53:37.240
YOU TAKING THE TIME TO CREATE

02:53:37.306 --> 02:53:38.474
THIS COMMITTEE. I THINK IT'S

02:53:38.541 --> 02:53:39.609
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS

02:53:39.675 --> 02:53:41.244
ON HOUSING BECAUSE IT IS THE

02:53:41.310 --> 02:53:43.379
CRITICAL ISSUE THAT COMES UP.

02:53:43.446 --> 02:53:44.814
IT'S THE THROUGH LINE AND ALL

02:53:44.881 --> 02:53:46.249
OF THE POLLING I SEE IN MY

02:53:46.315 --> 02:53:47.750
CLIENTS THROUGH LINE, AND ALL

02:53:47.817 --> 02:53:49.118
OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU SPEAK TO

02:53:49.185 --> 02:53:50.787
ON A REGULAR BASIS, HOUSING IS

02:53:50.853 --> 02:53:52.255
THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT

02:53:52.321 --> 02:53:53.256
NOW, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:53:53.322 --> 02:53:54.323
YOUR TIME. I JUST WANTED TO

KIND OF ECHO AS WELL THE

02:53:56.425 --> 02:53:57.260
IMPORTANCE OF TAX CREDITS. I

02:53:57.326 --> 02:53:59.195
THINK IT WAS GREAT TO HEAR

02:53:59.262 --> 02:54:00.329
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LIHTC. AND

02:54:00.396 --> 02:54:01.664
SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO NOTE

02:54:01.731 --> 02:54:03.232
IS THAT IT IS ALSO CRITICAL

02:54:03.299 --> 02:54:04.500
THAT WE THINK ABOUT OWNERSHIP.

02:54:04.567 --> 02:54:06.569
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE LOW

02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:07.870
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. WE

02:54:07.937 --> 02:54:09.672
HAD A BILL THIS YEAR, AB 595,

02:54:09.739 --> 02:54:10.306
WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY HELD IN

02:54:10.373 --> 02:54:11.407
THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

02:54:11.474 --> 02:54:12.842
THAT WOULD HAVE EXTENDED THOSE

02:54:12.909 --> 02:54:14.544
CREDITS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP

02:54:14.610 --> 02:54:15.311
OPPORTUNITIES. THIS IS

02:54:15.378 --> 02:54:16.245
PARTICULARLY CRITICAL BECAUSE,

02:54:16.312 --> 02:54:18.347
AS EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS, THAT

02:54:18.414 --> 02:54:20.049
IS A CRITICAL TOOL TO BUILDING

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:21.250
GENERATIONAL WEALTH. IT HELPS

02:54:21.317 --> 02:54:22.351
PEOPLE BUILD THAT THROUGHOUT

02:54:22.418 --> 02:54:24.353
THEIR COMMUNITIES. IT HELPS

02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:25.388
ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME

02:54:25.454 --> 02:54:26.422
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF

02:54:26.489 --> 02:54:29.025
COLOR. US IN PARTICULAR FOCUSES

02:54:29.091 --> 02:54:31.327
ON THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, AND

02:54:31.394 --> 02:54:33.462
OWNERSHIP IS A CRITICAL PIECE

02:54:33.529 --> 02:54:35.331
OF THEIR ADVOCACY. I ALSO

02:54:35.398 --> 02:54:36.465
WANTED TO SAY THAT IT'S

02:54:36.532 --> 02:54:38.201
IMPORTANT THAT WE EXPAND

02:54:38.267 --> 02:54:39.635
CONSTRUCTION FUNDS FOR

02:54:39.702 --> 02:54:41.270
OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL.

02:54:41.337 --> 02:54:42.104
DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE IS

02:54:42.171 --> 02:54:44.140
IMPORTANT. WE AGREE WITH THAT

02:54:44.207 --> 02:54:46.709
AS WELL, BUT IT ALSO DOESN'T

02:54:46.776 --> 02:54:47.476
CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:54:47.543 --> 02:54:49.412
CONSTRUCTION FUNDS. SO WE WANT

02:54:49.478 --> 02:54:50.446
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:54:50.513 --> 02:54:51.247
BRINGING OWNERSHIP UNITS ONLINE

02:54:51.314 --> 02:54:54.317
AS WELL. ALSO, JUST WANTED TO

02:54:54.383 --> 02:54:55.685
THANK EVERYBODY FOR BRINGING UP

02:54:55.751 --> 02:54:57.587
THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING TO

02:54:57.653 --> 02:54:59.422
INVEST IN ADUS. WE HAVE SEEN

02:54:59.488 --> 02:55:01.224
THAT BE ONE OF THE MOST

02:55:01.290 --> 02:55:02.725
EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR BRINGING

02:55:02.792 --> 02:55:04.360
NEW UNITS ONLINE. AND SO WE

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:05.828
JUST WANTED TO AGREE WITH

02:55:05.895 --> 02:55:07.830
EVERYONE ELSE'S COMMENTS ABOUT

02:55:07.897 --> 02:55:08.998
THE NEED TO STREAMLINE THOSE

02:55:09.065 --> 02:55:11.067
ADU CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES, AS

02:55:11.133 --> 02:55:11.601
WELL AS FIND NEW WAYS FOR

02:55:11.667 --> 02:55:13.269
FINANCING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:55:13.336 --> 02:55:15.071
TIME. THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT,

02:55:15.137 --> 02:55:16.806
I JUST WANT TO THANK OUR

02:55:16.873 --> 02:55:19.208
PANELISTS. THIS IS ONE OF MANY

02:55:19.275 --> 02:55:21.744
MEETINGS I HOPE TO HAVE WITH

02:55:21.811 --> 02:55:24.380
YOU ALL. NÃ KNOW THEY'RE DONE.

02:55:24.447 --> 02:55:28.284
OH, I'M SWITCHING. SO THANK YOU

02:55:28.351 --> 02:55:30.519
ALL FOR COMING AND LOOK FORWARD

02:55:30.586 --> 02:55:33.890
TO CONNECTING WITH YOU ALL

02:55:33.956 --> 02:55:35.091
OFFLINE AND WITH MY STAFF. SO

02:55:35.157 --> 02:55:37.426
THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY.

02:55:37.493 --> 02:55:40.663
THANK YOU. WE ARE NOW GOING TO

02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:46.569
SWITCH TO OUR SECOND PANEL. AND

02:55:46.636 --> 02:55:48.437
WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING

02:55:48.504 --> 02:55:50.673
MARKET RATE AND MIXED INCOME

02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:53.743
PROJECT FINANCING. AND WE HAVE

02:55:53.809 --> 02:55:55.244
BEN METCALF, THE MANAGING

02:55:55.311 --> 02:55:57.179
DIRECTOR FOR THE TURNER CENTER

02:55:57.246 --> 02:55:58.247
WITH THE HOUSING INNOVATION AND

02:55:58.314 --> 02:56:02.018
UC BERKELEY, ALSO SOMEONE I

02:56:02.084 --> 02:56:04.220
SERVED WITH MANY MOONS AGO. IT

02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:08.291
FEELS LIKE SO, SO GOOD TO SEE

02:56:08.357 --> 02:56:18.935
YOU. AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

02:56:19.001 --> 02:56:21.037
GREAT. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:23.139
CHAIRWOMAN. COMMITTEE MEMBERS

02:56:23.205 --> 02:56:24.507
AGAIN. MY NAME IS BEN METCALF.

02:56:24.573 --> 02:56:26.042
I'M WITH THE TURNER CENTER AT

02:56:26.108 --> 02:56:27.410
UC BERKELEY, RESEARCH

02:56:27.476 --> 02:56:29.478
INSTITUTION FOCUSED ON HOUSING

02:56:29.545 --> 02:56:31.213
POLICY. AND I'M GOING TO SORT

02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:33.349
OF HELP WITH THE PIVOT HERE AS

02:56:33.416 --> 02:56:34.150
WE TALK MORE GENERALLY ABOUT

02:56:34.216 --> 02:56:35.418
THE HOUSING MARKETS AND THINK

02:56:35.484 --> 02:56:38.020
ABOUT WHAT ELSE THE STATE CAN

02:56:38.087 --> 02:56:38.554
BE DOING TO HELP SPUR THE

02:56:38.621 --> 02:56:40.589
CONSTRUCTION OF MORE HOUSING TO

02:56:40.656 --> 02:56:42.291
MEET THE STATE'S NEEDS. THERE'S

02:56:42.358 --> 02:56:43.826
NO CLICKER. I JUST SAY NEXT

02:56:43.893 --> 02:56:46.062
SLIDE. IS THAT RIGHT? YES. NEXT

02:56:46.128 --> 02:56:50.433
SLIDE. SO WHILE AFFORDABLE

02:56:50.499 --> 02:56:51.567
HOUSING IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

02:56:51.634 --> 02:56:53.336
FOR THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO

02:56:53.402 --> 02:56:55.237
ACCESS IT, DEED RESTRICTED

02:56:55.304 --> 02:56:56.305
AFFORDABLE UNITS HAVE

02:56:56.372 --> 02:56:57.473
REPRESENTED PROBABLY ONLY ABOUT

02:56:57.540 --> 02:56:59.175
20% OF THE STATE OF

02:56:59.241 --> 02:56:59.809
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING PRODUCTION

02:56:59.875 --> 02:57:02.078
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO

02:57:02.144 --> 02:57:04.213
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE OVERALL

02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:05.481
HOUSING GOAL, WHAT WE'RE REALLY

02:57:05.548 --> 02:57:07.683
TALKING ABOUT IS MARKET RATE,

02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:10.419
HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND IT'S

02:57:10.486 --> 02:57:12.254
WORTH NOTING, JUST AS YOU LOOK

02:57:12.321 --> 02:57:13.422
AT THE HISTORY HERE, WE'VE BEEN

02:57:13.489 --> 02:57:16.192
IN A SYSTEMIC DECLINE OF MARKET

02:57:16.258 --> 02:57:17.360
RATE HOUSING OVER THE LAST HALF

02:57:17.426 --> 02:57:19.462
CENTURY OR SO. THAT'S DUE TO A

02:57:19.528 --> 02:57:20.262
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS.

02:57:20.329 --> 02:57:21.831
AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE

02:57:21.897 --> 02:57:22.765
CHALLENGE OF AFFORDABILITY WRIT

02:57:22.832 --> 02:57:24.500
LARGE, OBVIOUSLY, PART OF THE

02:57:24.567 --> 02:57:26.302
REASON WHY WE'VE BEEN NEEDING

02:57:26.369 --> 02:57:28.437
TO BUILD SO MANY DEED

02:57:28.504 --> 02:57:29.305
RESTRICTED, SUBSIDIZED

02:57:29.372 --> 02:57:30.373
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS BECAUSE

02:57:30.439 --> 02:57:33.776
OF A FAILURE OF THE MARKET TO

02:57:33.843 --> 02:57:35.277
GENERATE ENOUGH HOUSING TO MEET

02:57:35.344 --> 02:57:37.346
THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:57:37.413 --> 02:57:38.514
IN THE MIDDLE WORKFORCE.

02:57:38.581 --> 02:57:40.216
HOUSING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND

02:57:40.282 --> 02:57:43.185
IN FACT, TODAY, CALIFORNIA IS

02:57:43.252 --> 02:57:46.422
FAR, FAR BEHIND MANY OTHER

02:57:46.489 --> 02:57:47.623
PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY IN

02:57:47.690 --> 02:57:49.258
TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO SORT OF

02:57:49.325 --> 02:57:51.193
UNLOCK HOUSING DEMAND. THIS IS

02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:53.496
SO THIS CHART JUST SHOWS

02:57:53.562 --> 02:57:54.263
CALIFORNIA AT ABOUT NUMBER 39

02:57:54.330 --> 02:57:56.365
OUT OF 50 STATES IN TERMS OF

02:57:56.432 --> 02:57:58.300
ITS HOUSING PRODUCTION ON A PER

02:57:58.367 --> 02:58:00.036
CAPITA BASIS. AND THIS SHOULD

02:58:00.102 --> 02:58:02.238
BE SURPRISING, RIGHT, IN THE

02:58:02.304 --> 02:58:03.472
SENSE THAT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE

02:58:03.539 --> 02:58:05.207
A VIBRANT ECONOMY. IT IS A

02:58:05.274 --> 02:58:06.308
PLACE WITH A WONDERFUL CLIMATE

02:58:06.375 --> 02:58:08.377
AND HOSPITABLE PEOPLE, AND

02:58:08.444 --> 02:58:09.545
GENERALLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF

02:58:09.612 --> 02:58:11.180
DEMAND FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE IN.

02:58:11.247 --> 02:58:13.482
AND YET WHAT WE SEE INSTEAD IS

02:58:13.549 --> 02:58:16.419
VERY SIGNIFICANT DOMESTIC NET

02:58:16.485 --> 02:58:18.554
OUTWARD MIGRATION BECAUSE OF AN

02:58:18.621 --> 02:58:20.823
INABILITY TO FIND THE HOMES AT

02:58:20.890 --> 02:58:22.158
AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. SO WHY IS

02:58:22.224 --> 02:58:24.360
THIS NEXT SLIDE? SO I WANT TO

02:58:24.427 --> 02:58:26.295
DO A LITTLE BIT OF A PRIMER FOR

02:58:26.362 --> 02:58:28.297
YOU ON SORT OF HOW TO THINK

02:58:28.364 --> 02:58:29.532
ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. BECAUSE IN

02:58:29.598 --> 02:58:30.699
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SPACE,

02:58:30.766 --> 02:58:32.268
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT EFFICIENCY

02:58:32.334 --> 02:58:34.437
AND SUBSIDY ON THE MARKET RATE

02:58:34.503 --> 02:58:35.704
SIDE. TYPICALLY WE'RE NOT

02:58:35.771 --> 02:58:37.239
COMING AT THIS FROM A SUBSIDY

02:58:37.306 --> 02:58:38.340
PERSPECTIVE. SO THE ANSWER

02:58:38.407 --> 02:58:40.309
DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO, HEY,

02:58:40.376 --> 02:58:41.277
PUT SOME MONEY ON A BOND OR

02:58:41.343 --> 02:58:43.546
FIND MONEY FROM THE GENERAL

02:58:43.612 --> 02:58:44.480
FUND. IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF

02:58:44.547 --> 02:58:46.115
WHAT ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH

02:58:46.182 --> 02:58:47.183
WE'VE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR

02:58:47.249 --> 02:58:48.417
BUILDERS TO BUILD, AND

02:58:48.484 --> 02:58:49.351
PARTICULARLY FOR BUILDERS TO

02:58:49.418 --> 02:58:50.686
BUILD THE KINDS OF HOUSING THAT

02:58:50.753 --> 02:58:53.255
WE PROBABLY MOST WANT TO SEE.

02:58:53.322 --> 02:58:55.257
ENTRY LEVEL, PERHAPS INFILL,

02:58:55.324 --> 02:58:56.792
PERHAPS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND

02:58:56.859 --> 02:58:58.828
APPROPRIATELY LOCATED IN ARE

02:58:58.894 --> 02:58:59.428
MORE CLIMATE SENSITIVE AREAS.

02:58:59.495 --> 02:59:01.330
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR A

02:59:01.397 --> 02:59:03.132
FEW MINUTES IS SORT OF RUN YOU

02:59:03.199 --> 02:59:04.266
THROUGH A LITTLE EXERCISE HERE

02:59:04.333 --> 02:59:06.435
THAT ASKS A FEW QUESTIONS. WHAT

02:59:06.502 --> 02:59:08.537
BASICALLY COMING DOWN TO, WHAT

02:59:08.604 --> 02:59:10.439
IS IT THAT DETERMINES WHETHER A

02:59:10.506 --> 02:59:12.041
BUILDER WILL CHOOSE TO BUILD,

02:59:12.108 --> 02:59:13.342
AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN

02:59:13.409 --> 02:59:16.545
THIS AFTERNOON SESSION? THE

02:59:16.612 --> 02:59:17.179
STATE HAS ACTUALLY MADE A FAIR

02:59:17.246 --> 02:59:19.181
AMOUNT OF PROGRESS ON UPZONING.

02:59:19.248 --> 02:59:20.382
THERE ARE MANY CITIES THAT HAVE

02:59:20.449 --> 02:59:23.185
BUILT FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT

02:59:23.252 --> 02:59:25.988
LANDSCAPES. WE. THIS

02:59:26.055 --> 02:59:28.457
LEGISLATURE ENACTED A

02:59:28.524 --> 02:59:30.326
SIGNIFICANT REFORM THAT'S

02:59:30.392 --> 02:59:32.261
PROVIDED QUITE A BIT MORE

02:59:32.328 --> 02:59:33.362
CERTAINTY FOR BUILDERS. AND SO

02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:35.664
THE QUESTION BECOMES, WELL,

02:59:35.731 --> 02:59:37.233
WHAT IF WE SUCCEED IN

02:59:37.299 --> 02:59:38.434
PERFECTING SORT OF THE

02:59:38.501 --> 02:59:39.602
REGULATORY ZONING ENVELOPE HERE

02:59:39.668 --> 02:59:41.103
AND BUILDERS AREN'T BUILDING

02:59:41.170 --> 02:59:42.404
WHAT'S GOING ON? AND WHAT CAN

02:59:42.471 --> 02:59:44.140
WE DO ABOUT THAT NEXT SLIDE? SO

02:59:44.206 --> 02:59:46.375
I WANT TO I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE

02:59:46.442 --> 02:59:48.444
WITH ME FOR A SECOND A

02:59:48.511 --> 02:59:50.346
DELIGHTFUL PLACE CALLED TURNER

02:59:50.412 --> 02:59:52.748
TERRACE, WHICH IS A

02:59:52.815 --> 02:59:54.683
PROTOTYPICAL MARKET RATE FOR

02:59:54.750 --> 02:59:56.519
RENT BUILDING WITH 100 UNITS

02:59:56.585 --> 02:59:58.220
THAT A DEVELOPER WANTS TO BUILD

02:59:58.287 --> 03:00:00.222
ON A ON A LOT ON AN ACRE OF

03:00:00.289 --> 03:00:03.058
LAND THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO

03:00:03.125 --> 03:00:04.360
AND IS RUNNING THEIR MODEL,

03:00:04.426 --> 03:00:05.494
THEY'RE RUNNING THEIR PROFORMAS,

03:00:05.561 --> 03:00:06.662
THEY'RE TRYING TO SEE IF THEY

03:00:06.729 --> 03:00:08.531
CAN BRING THE CAPITAL IN TO

03:00:08.597 --> 03:00:09.498
MAKE IT HAPPEN. WHAT'S GOING

03:00:09.565 --> 03:00:15.237
THROUGH THEIR HEAD? NEXT SLIDE.

03:00:15.304 --> 03:00:18.307
SO ACTUALLY WE CAN GO TO THE

03:00:18.374 --> 03:00:20.476
NEXT SLIDE. THANK YOU. SO IN

03:00:20.543 --> 03:00:23.479
THIS CASE A DEVELOPER HAS A SET

03:00:23.546 --> 03:00:25.147
OF COSTS THAT THEY'VE COME UP

03:00:25.214 --> 03:00:27.283
WITH WORKING WITH A CONTRACTOR

03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:28.617
AND HAVE DETERMINED THAT THEY

03:00:28.684 --> 03:00:29.218
HAVE A PROJECT THAT THEY WANT

03:00:29.285 --> 03:00:32.388
TO BUILD. AND THE THE INPUTS

03:00:32.454 --> 03:00:34.223
THAT GO INTO THAT ARE, BROADLY

03:00:34.290 --> 03:00:36.358
SPEAKING, HARD COSTS. SO THE

03:00:36.425 --> 03:00:37.560
LITERALLY THE COST TO HIRE

03:00:37.626 --> 03:00:39.195
PEOPLE TO GET OUT THERE AND

03:00:39.261 --> 03:00:40.296
BUILD THE MATERIALS THAT GO

03:00:40.362 --> 03:00:42.831
WITH IT, THE SOFT COSTS, WHICH

03:00:42.898 --> 03:00:43.265
ARE ARCHITECTURE AND

03:00:43.332 --> 03:00:45.367
ENGINEERING, LEGAL FEES, PERMIT

03:00:45.434 --> 03:00:47.236
COSTS AND THE LIKE, AS WELL AS

03:00:47.303 --> 03:00:49.205
LAND COSTS. AND IF YOU JUST

03:00:49.271 --> 03:00:50.372
TOGGLE FORWARD A COUPLE SLIDES

03:00:50.439 --> 03:00:52.508
HERE, YOU CAN SEE THE SORT OF

03:00:52.575 --> 03:00:53.242
COMPONENTS THAT WE PROGRAM FOR

03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:55.644
OUR MODEL, WITH BLUE AT THE

03:00:55.711 --> 03:00:58.247
BASE BEING LAND, YELLOW BEING

03:00:58.314 --> 03:00:59.548
THE THE HARD COST, AND THEN THE

03:00:59.615 --> 03:01:01.183
LIGHT BLUE AT THE TOP BEING THE

03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:03.285
SOFT COSTS. SO THIS ISN'T I'M

03:01:03.352 --> 03:01:05.487
NOT OFFERING HERE THIS, THIS

03:01:05.554 --> 03:01:08.290
PARTICULAR 80.8, $80.8 MILLION

03:01:08.357 --> 03:01:10.092
PROJECT IS NOT HOW EVERY

03:01:10.159 --> 03:01:12.194
PROJECT WILL LOOK LIKE, BUT

03:01:12.261 --> 03:01:14.196
BASED ON A NUMBER OF SURVEYS

03:01:14.263 --> 03:01:16.265
THAT WE'VE DONE WITH DEVELOPERS,

03:01:16.332 --> 03:01:17.266
IT'S FAIRLY REPRESENTATIVE OF

03:01:17.333 --> 03:01:19.702
WHAT WHAT A PROJECT LIKE THIS

03:01:19.768 --> 03:01:22.338
MIGHT LOOK LIKE. NEXT SLIDE. SO

03:01:22.404 --> 03:01:24.540
I THINK ONE PIECE OF CONTEXT

03:01:24.607 --> 03:01:25.774
HERE IS JUST TO UNDERSTAND THAT

03:01:25.841 --> 03:01:27.576
COSTS HAVE BEEN RISING. AND SO

03:01:27.643 --> 03:01:31.080
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE TODAY OF A

03:01:31.146 --> 03:01:32.548
INCREASE OF COSTS THAT HAS BEEN

03:01:32.615 --> 03:01:35.384
GOING YEAR OVER YEAR AT A RATE

03:01:35.451 --> 03:01:37.219
WELL IN EXCESS OF INFLATION.

03:01:37.286 --> 03:01:38.320
THAT'S TRUE FOR BOTH LABOR

03:01:38.387 --> 03:01:40.389
COSTS AND IT'S TRUE FOR

03:01:40.456 --> 03:01:41.023
MATERIAL COSTS. I APOLOGIZE FOR

03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:42.391
THOSE IN THE BACK HERE, BUT

03:01:42.458 --> 03:01:44.360
THIS GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF A

03:01:44.426 --> 03:01:46.428
SENSE OF THE DEGREE OF WHICH

03:01:46.495 --> 03:01:47.129
WE'VE BEEN SEEING THESE

03:01:47.196 --> 03:01:48.130
EXCEPTIONAL INCREASES IN REAL

03:01:48.197 --> 03:01:50.132
TERMS YEAR OVER YEAR. NEXT

03:01:50.199 --> 03:01:56.205
SLIDE. SO WHEN THE DEVELOPER

03:01:56.272 --> 03:01:58.274
NOW KNOWS WHAT THEIR COSTS ARE,

03:01:58.340 --> 03:02:00.009
THEY HAVE A SKETCH. THEY HAVE A

03:02:00.075 --> 03:02:01.210
VISION, THEY HAVE A PROFORMA.

03:02:01.277 --> 03:02:02.378
ESSENTIALLY THEY NOW NEED TO GO

03:02:02.444 --> 03:02:04.046
OUT AND FIND THE CAPITAL TO

03:02:04.113 --> 03:02:05.514
BUILD THIS. MOST DEVELOPERS

03:02:05.581 --> 03:02:06.448
THEMSELVES DO NOT FULLY FINANCE.

03:02:06.515 --> 03:02:08.751
VERY FEW FULLY FINANCED THE

03:02:08.817 --> 03:02:09.351
PROJECTS THEMSELVES. INSTEAD,

03:02:09.418 --> 03:02:11.387
THEY'RE REALLY PULLING FROM TWO

03:02:11.453 --> 03:02:13.188
SOURCES OF CAPITAL. THE FIRST

03:02:13.255 --> 03:02:15.724
PLACE THEY GO TO IS A BANK,

03:02:15.791 --> 03:02:16.692
WHICH OFFERS THEM CONVENTIONAL

03:02:16.759 --> 03:02:19.295
FINANCING. AND THEIR NUMBER ONE

03:02:19.361 --> 03:02:20.462
JOB AS DEVELOPERS. TYPICALLY TO

03:02:20.529 --> 03:02:23.165
MAXIMIZE THAT OUT BANK MONEY,

03:02:23.232 --> 03:02:24.233
DEBT MONEY, HARD MONEY IS

03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:25.467
ACTUALLY OFTEN THE BEST KIND OF

03:02:25.534 --> 03:02:27.169
CAPITAL YOU CAN GET. IT'S

03:02:27.236 --> 03:02:29.672
FAIRLY LOW COST. IT'S GOING TO

03:02:29.738 --> 03:02:31.073
BE CHEAPER THAN WHATEVER YOU

03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:32.508
CAN GET ON THE EQUITY SIDE. AND

03:02:32.574 --> 03:02:34.476
SO YOU START BY REALLY GOING TO

03:02:34.543 --> 03:02:35.344
THE BANK AND SAYING, OKAY,

03:02:35.411 --> 03:02:37.379
GIVEN WHAT I'M SHOWING ON MY

03:02:37.446 --> 03:02:39.148
CASH FLOW, GIVEN WHAT MY TOTAL

03:02:39.214 --> 03:02:40.482
VALUE IS, GIVEN THE STANDARD

03:02:40.549 --> 03:02:42.418
RISKS THAT YOU SEE IN THE

03:02:42.484 --> 03:02:43.786
MARKETPLACE, HOW MUCH OF THIS

03:02:43.852 --> 03:02:45.154
PROJECT CAN YOU FINANCE AS DEBT?

03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:46.455
AND THE BANKS WILL BASICALLY

03:02:46.522 --> 03:02:47.923
UNDERWRITE THAT AND GIVE A

03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:49.458
NUMBER BACK. SOMETIMES THE

03:02:49.525 --> 03:02:50.326
UPWARD CONSTRAINT IS HAS TO DO

03:02:50.392 --> 03:02:52.494
WITH THE CASH FLOW ON THE BACK

03:02:52.561 --> 03:02:53.329
END. SOMETIMES THE CONSTRAINT

03:02:53.395 --> 03:02:55.297
HAS TO DO WITH THE TOTAL VALUE.

03:02:55.364 --> 03:02:57.466
A BANK NEVER IS GOING TO WANT

03:02:57.533 --> 03:02:58.400
TO FUND THE WHOLE THING. THEY

03:02:58.467 --> 03:03:00.336
ALWAYS WANT TO BE SIMPLY A

03:03:00.402 --> 03:03:01.203
SHARE OF THE TOTAL. IN THIS

03:03:01.270 --> 03:03:03.138
CASE. ON OUR PROJECT, WE FOUND

03:03:03.205 --> 03:03:04.740
THAT A BANK, THESE KINDS OF

03:03:04.807 --> 03:03:05.708
DEALS WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO

03:03:05.774 --> 03:03:07.209
COME IN AT ABOUT 55% OF THE

03:03:07.276 --> 03:03:08.444
TOTAL VALUATION. SO THAT GIVES

03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:10.446
YOU 44 POINT MILLION IN DEBT.

03:03:10.512 --> 03:03:12.081
THAT'S SORT OF SOMEWHAT PERHAPS

03:03:12.147 --> 03:03:14.350
THE EASY PART. THE HARD PART

03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:16.185
THEN BECOMES, OKAY, NOW I NEED

03:03:16.251 --> 03:03:17.252
TO RAISE THE REST. THAT MONEY

03:03:17.319 --> 03:03:19.254
IS COMING FROM EQUITY INVESTORS

03:03:19.321 --> 03:03:21.357
WHO ARE GOING TO ASK FOR MUCH

03:03:21.423 --> 03:03:22.558
HIGHER RETURN THRESHOLDS,

03:03:22.624 --> 03:03:24.126
BECAUSE IT IS THEIR MONEY THAT

03:03:24.193 --> 03:03:26.395
IS GOING TO BE AT RISK. SO THE

03:03:26.462 --> 03:03:28.497
ARE THE THE MONEY THAT IS GOING

03:03:28.564 --> 03:03:30.099
TO TAKE THE HIT. IF THIS

03:03:30.165 --> 03:03:31.166
PROJECT DOESN'T PERFORM OR IF

03:03:31.233 --> 03:03:34.370
IT CAN'T BE BUILT. NEXT SLIDE.

03:03:34.436 --> 03:03:36.205
SO WHO ARE THESE INVESTORS THAT

03:03:36.271 --> 03:03:37.973
MIGHT INVEST IN IN IN PROJECTS.

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:40.275
WELL FOR SMALLER DEALS IT'S

03:03:40.342 --> 03:03:41.510
OFTEN, YOU KNOW, FRIENDS AND

03:03:41.577 --> 03:03:43.212
FAMILY. IT'S YOU KNOW, MOM AND

03:03:43.278 --> 03:03:44.413
POP FOLKS ARE GOING TO THE

03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:46.482
FOLKS THAT THEY KNOW. LARGER

03:03:46.548 --> 03:03:47.149
DEVELOPERS, HOWEVER, ARE

03:03:47.216 --> 03:03:49.518
PLAYING IN A PRETTY

03:03:49.585 --> 03:03:50.819
SOPHISTICATED INSTITUTIONAL

03:03:50.886 --> 03:03:51.887
MARKETPLACE WITH PRIVATE EQUITY

03:03:51.954 --> 03:03:54.256
COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING

03:03:54.323 --> 03:03:55.324
INVESTMENTS ACROSS A WHOLE

03:03:55.391 --> 03:03:56.392
RANGE OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES.

03:03:56.458 --> 03:03:58.260
THEY MAY HAVE AN ARM THAT DOES

03:03:58.327 --> 03:04:00.295
COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL

03:04:00.362 --> 03:04:01.263
LOGISTICS, AN ARM THAT DOES

03:04:01.330 --> 03:04:03.198
RESIDENTIAL PENSION FUNDS HAVE

03:04:03.265 --> 03:04:04.299
HISTORICALLY BEEN MAJOR

03:04:04.366 --> 03:04:06.902
INVESTORS INTO HOUSING, AS HAVE

03:04:06.969 --> 03:04:10.773
INSURANCE COMPANIES. NEXT SLIDE.

03:04:10.839 --> 03:04:14.076
THESE INVESTORS HAVE CAPITAL

03:04:14.143 --> 03:04:15.377
THAT THEY ARE MAKING A CHOICE

03:04:15.444 --> 03:04:17.379
TO INVEST. AND THEY HAVE

03:04:17.446 --> 03:04:19.014
CHOICES. THEY COULD CHOOSE TO

03:04:19.081 --> 03:04:19.748
INVEST IT INTO A LOGISTICS

03:04:19.815 --> 03:04:21.283
FACILITY. THEY COULD CHOOSE TO

03:04:21.350 --> 03:04:22.851
PUT IT INTO TREASURIES. THEY

03:04:22.918 --> 03:04:23.452
COULD CHOOSE TO DEPLOY IT IN

03:04:23.519 --> 03:04:25.187
ARIZONA. AND SO TYPICALLY

03:04:25.254 --> 03:04:26.355
INVESTORS WILL HAVE A CERTAIN

03:04:26.422 --> 03:04:27.923
RETURN THRESHOLD THAT THEY'RE

03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:29.158
GETTING ON THESE KINDS OF

03:04:29.224 --> 03:04:31.326
MULTIFAMILY ASSETS. THAT RETURN

03:04:31.393 --> 03:04:32.728
HURDLE RATE IS OFTEN EXPRESSED

03:04:32.795 --> 03:04:34.396
AS A SORT OF RETURN ON RETURN

03:04:34.463 --> 03:04:38.801
ON COST, WHICH KEYS OFF OF THE

03:04:38.867 --> 03:04:39.368
ASSUMED CAPITALIZATION RATES

03:04:39.435 --> 03:04:41.737
FOR THAT PROJECT. NEXT SLIDE.

03:04:41.804 --> 03:04:46.341
SO FOR OUR DEAL, WE ARE

03:04:46.408 --> 03:04:49.311
ASSUMING THAT WHAT IS GOING TO

03:04:49.378 --> 03:04:50.879
MOTIVATE AN INVESTOR TO INVEST

03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:52.347
ON A NEW PROJECT IS GOING TO BE

03:04:52.414 --> 03:04:54.383
THAT THEY'RE GETTING A BETTER

03:04:54.450 --> 03:04:55.250
RETURN THAN WHAT THEY WOULD GET

03:04:55.317 --> 03:04:56.518
FROM SIMPLY BUYING AN EXISTING

03:04:56.585 --> 03:04:58.520
ASSET. AND THE RULE OF THUMB

03:04:58.587 --> 03:05:00.856
THAT WE USE HERE FOR OUR MODEL

03:05:00.923 --> 03:05:02.291
IS IT HAS TO BE ABOUT ONE

03:05:02.357 --> 03:05:03.325
PERCENTAGE POINT HIGHER. NEXT,

03:05:03.392 --> 03:05:06.161
NEXT SLIDE. SO IN OTHER WORDS,

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:08.831
IF AN INVESTOR COULD SIMPLY BUY

03:05:08.897 --> 03:05:09.298
AN EXISTING OPERATING

03:05:09.364 --> 03:05:10.399
MULTIFAMILY PROPERTY TODAY AND

03:05:10.466 --> 03:05:12.468
GET A PRETTY SAFE 5% RETURN IF

03:05:12.534 --> 03:05:14.269
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO INVEST

03:05:14.336 --> 03:05:16.405
INTO A NEW PROJECT WITH ALL THE

03:05:16.472 --> 03:05:17.606
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT

03:05:17.673 --> 03:05:18.140
COME WITH ENTITLEMENTS AND

03:05:18.207 --> 03:05:19.174
PERMITS AND CONSTRUCTION,

03:05:19.241 --> 03:05:20.642
THEY'RE GOING TO DEMAND A

03:05:20.709 --> 03:05:22.711
HIGHER RETURN, A CAP AND LOOK

03:05:22.778 --> 03:05:23.479
FOR A CAP RATE THAT'S CLOSER TO

03:05:23.545 --> 03:05:29.351
6%. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHEN WE

03:05:29.418 --> 03:05:32.187
ACTUALLY RUN THE MATH ON OUR

03:05:32.254 --> 03:05:33.288
PROTOTYPICAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE

03:05:33.355 --> 03:05:35.057
EAST BAY, 120 UNITS WITH A

03:05:35.123 --> 03:05:36.658
LITTLE BIT OF RETAIL, SOME

03:05:36.725 --> 03:05:38.393
PARKING, WE ACTUALLY FIND THAT

03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:39.628
THAT A TYPICAL INVESTOR IN

03:05:39.695 --> 03:05:41.096
TODAY'S MARKET HAS A VERY HARD

03:05:41.163 --> 03:05:43.332
TIME MAKING IT. IN FACT, OUR

03:05:43.398 --> 03:05:44.199
PROTOTYPICAL PRO FORMA ACTUALLY

03:05:44.266 --> 03:05:47.569
CAME UP AS A LITTLE CIRCLE WITH

03:05:47.636 --> 03:05:49.538
A LINE THROUGH IT. IT DOESN'T

03:05:49.605 --> 03:05:50.239
PENCIL. WE BASICALLY SHOWED

03:05:50.305 --> 03:05:52.074
THAT GIVEN WHAT WE COULD

03:05:52.140 --> 03:05:53.175
REASONABLY EXPECT IN RENTS

03:05:53.242 --> 03:05:55.811
RELATIVE TO COSTS, A TYPICAL

03:05:55.878 --> 03:05:56.945
PROJECT TODAY IN A TYPICAL

03:05:57.012 --> 03:05:59.615
MARKET COULD ONLY RETURN 4.7 OR

03:05:59.681 --> 03:06:01.583
4.8%, AND NOT THE MINIMUM RATE

03:06:01.650 --> 03:06:03.285
THAT INVESTOR WOULD BE LOOKING

03:06:03.352 --> 03:06:05.320
FOR. SO THAT'S A PROBLEM,

03:06:05.387 --> 03:06:06.522
BECAUSE IT MEANS THE CAPITAL

03:06:06.588 --> 03:06:08.223
WON'T FLOW TO A DEAL EVEN WHEN

03:06:08.290 --> 03:06:09.525
THERE'S A SITE AVAILABLE, EVEN

03:06:09.591 --> 03:06:11.326
WHEN THE ZONING PERMITS IT. AND

03:06:11.393 --> 03:06:12.227
SO IT BEGINS TO BEG THIS

03:06:12.294 --> 03:06:14.029
QUESTION OF, WELL, WHAT DO WE

03:06:14.096 --> 03:06:15.631
DO AND WHAT CAN WHAT CAN THE

03:06:15.697 --> 03:06:17.165
GOVERNMENT DO? THE GOVERNMENT

03:06:17.232 --> 03:06:18.333
CAN'T. STATE GOVERNMENT CAN'T

03:06:18.400 --> 03:06:19.768
DIRECTLY INTERVENE TO CHANGE

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:20.302
THE RETURN THRESHOLDS THAT

03:06:20.369 --> 03:06:22.838
INVESTMENT CAPITAL IS LOOKING

03:06:22.905 --> 03:06:28.977
FOR. NEXT SLIDE. SO YOU KNOW

03:06:29.044 --> 03:06:30.178
ONE ONE QUESTION IS AN OBVIOUS

03:06:30.245 --> 03:06:32.247
QUESTION TO START FROM. MIGHT

03:06:32.314 --> 03:06:33.315
JUST BE WELL YOU KNOW CAN'T THE

03:06:33.382 --> 03:06:35.183
INVESTOR. YOU CAN'T THE

03:06:35.250 --> 03:06:36.585
DEVELOPER JUST CHARGE MORE IN

03:06:36.652 --> 03:06:38.287
RENT. WELL THE PROBLEM THERE IS

03:06:38.353 --> 03:06:40.222
THAT TYPICALLY A DEVELOPER IS

03:06:40.289 --> 03:06:41.590
STARTING FROM THE POSITION OF

03:06:41.657 --> 03:06:43.191
TRYING TO OPTIMIZE THEIR RENT

03:06:43.258 --> 03:06:45.260
LEVELS. AND SO THEY ARE

03:06:45.327 --> 03:06:46.628
BASICALLY GOING TO RENT THEIR

03:06:46.695 --> 03:06:47.429
UNITS FOR WHATEVER THE MARKET

03:06:47.496 --> 03:06:49.331
WILL BEAR. THEY'RE GOING TO PUT

03:06:49.398 --> 03:06:50.432
THOSE UNITS UP AND THEY'RE

03:06:50.499 --> 03:06:52.134
GOING TO MAKE THEIR BEST GUESS

03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:53.302
IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET.

03:06:53.368 --> 03:06:55.404
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE

03:06:55.470 --> 03:06:56.605
INVESTORS ARE BASED ON. AND TO

03:06:56.672 --> 03:06:58.307
PRICE YOUR UNIT HIGHER THAN THE

03:06:58.373 --> 03:06:59.441
MARKET WOULD BE A POINTLESS

03:06:59.508 --> 03:07:00.676
EXERCISE. IT WOULD RESULT IN

03:07:00.742 --> 03:07:02.311
THE UNITS BEING HELD VACANT AND

03:07:02.377 --> 03:07:03.378
THE PROJECT LOSING MONEY. SO

03:07:03.445 --> 03:07:05.147
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE RENT YOU

03:07:05.213 --> 03:07:06.315
CAN RENT UNITS FOR VERY MUCH

03:07:06.381 --> 03:07:08.216
DETERMINES WHAT THE RETURN IS

03:07:08.283 --> 03:07:09.518
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET. AND

03:07:09.585 --> 03:07:11.386
SO IN OUR CASE, WE'RE ASSUMING

03:07:11.453 --> 03:07:13.322
A $3,500 A MONTH RENT. AND

03:07:13.388 --> 03:07:14.690
HYPOTHETICALLY IF YOU COULD GET

03:07:14.756 --> 03:07:16.325
A HIGHER RENT. SO IF YOU GO

03:07:16.391 --> 03:07:18.493
FORWARD ONE MORE SLIDE, IT

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:19.227
COULD ACTUALLY MAKE ALL THE

03:07:19.294 --> 03:07:21.263
DIFFERENCE. BUT IN TODAY'S

03:07:21.330 --> 03:07:22.664
ENVIRONMENT, A DEVELOPER

03:07:22.731 --> 03:07:23.231
INVESTOR HAS NO PARTICULAR

03:07:23.298 --> 03:07:25.200
REASON TO ASSUME THAT THE RENTS

03:07:25.267 --> 03:07:26.802
ARE GOING TO BE ANY HIGHER.

03:07:26.868 --> 03:07:28.036
THEY RUN THEIR MODELS AND THE

03:07:28.103 --> 03:07:29.271
RENTS ARE WHAT THE RENTS ARE ON

03:07:29.338 --> 03:07:31.406
A FORWARD BASIS. YOU KNOW,

03:07:31.473 --> 03:07:32.441
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO

03:07:32.507 --> 03:07:34.176
WITH WHAT THEY CAN PENCIL. SO

03:07:34.242 --> 03:07:35.410
$3,500 PER MONTH IS IS THE UNIT.

03:07:35.477 --> 03:07:37.546
THEN THE IS THE LIKELY OUTCOME.

03:07:37.613 --> 03:07:38.947
THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT

03:07:39.014 --> 03:07:39.915
ARE THE OTHER POLICY LEVERS

03:07:39.982 --> 03:07:40.949
THAT GOVERNMENT MIGHT HAVE?

03:07:41.016 --> 03:07:44.486
NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE

03:07:44.553 --> 03:07:46.622
IN SOME OF OUR EXERCISES HERE

03:07:46.688 --> 03:07:48.223
IS BASICALLY JUST TO TAKE THIS

03:07:48.290 --> 03:07:50.425
PROTOTYPICAL PRO FORMA AND LOOK

03:07:50.492 --> 03:07:52.260
AT POLICY LEVERS THAT STATE OR

03:07:52.327 --> 03:07:53.895
LOCAL POLICY MAKERS REASONABLY

03:07:53.962 --> 03:07:55.631
CONTROL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT

03:07:55.697 --> 03:07:57.199
MIGHT TAKE TO HELP AN INVESTOR

03:07:57.265 --> 03:07:58.266
GET THE KIND OF RETURNS THAT

03:07:58.333 --> 03:08:00.035
THEY WOULD NEED TO MAKE THESE

03:08:00.102 --> 03:08:01.737
PROJECTS GET OFF THE GROUND. SO

03:08:01.803 --> 03:08:02.471
HERE WE'VE GIVEN YOU FOUR

03:08:02.537 --> 03:08:04.640
EXAMPLES OF THIS. REDUCING

03:08:04.706 --> 03:08:07.676
IMPACT FEES, REDUCING REQUIRED

03:08:07.743 --> 03:08:09.111
PARKING, ALLOWING FOR HIGHER

03:08:09.177 --> 03:08:11.213
DENSITY, OR FINDING WAYS TO

03:08:11.279 --> 03:08:13.015
FACILITATE REDUCED HARD COSTS.

03:08:13.081 --> 03:08:14.449
AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IN OUR

03:08:14.516 --> 03:08:16.318
VERY SIMPLIFIED THING HERE IS

03:08:16.385 --> 03:08:17.352
THAT THERE ISN'T OFTEN ANY SORT

03:08:17.419 --> 03:08:19.354
OF SIMPLE BULLET. AND IN FACT,

03:08:19.421 --> 03:08:21.289
USUALLY TO GET THESE KINDS OF

03:08:21.356 --> 03:08:23.225
PROJECTS OFF THE GROUND INTO

03:08:23.291 --> 03:08:25.494
THE GROUND, POLICY MAKERS

03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:27.129
PROBABLY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT

03:08:27.195 --> 03:08:28.196
MULTIPLE DIFFERENT

03:08:28.263 --> 03:08:29.398
INTERVENTIONS TO TRY AND SORT

03:08:29.464 --> 03:08:31.099
OF BOOST THE COST THAT YOU CAN

03:08:31.166 --> 03:08:32.367
GET IN THESE PROJECTS. SO IN

03:08:32.434 --> 03:08:34.369
OUR SIMPLIFIED MODEL HERE, IT

03:08:34.436 --> 03:08:35.837
ACTUALLY TAKES ALL FOUR OF

03:08:35.904 --> 03:08:37.572
THESE INTERVENTIONS REDUCING

03:08:37.639 --> 03:08:39.074
FEES BY 10,000, REDUCING

03:08:39.141 --> 03:08:41.643
PARKING FEES TO 0.25 SPACES

03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:43.679
INCREASE ALLOWING DENSITY TO GO

03:08:43.745 --> 03:08:45.247
UP BY 30% AND THEN FINDING A

03:08:45.313 --> 03:08:47.382
WAY TO FACILITATE A REDUCTION

03:08:47.449 --> 03:08:48.450
COST BY 10% TO GET THE YIELDS

03:08:48.517 --> 03:08:51.987
THAT ARE REQUIRED. NEXT SLIDE.

03:08:52.054 --> 03:08:56.024
SO JUST IN CONCLUSION, I THINK

03:08:56.091 --> 03:08:59.194
THERE ARE MANY, MANY

03:08:59.261 --> 03:09:00.395
OPPORTUNITIES THAT STAND HERE.

03:09:00.462 --> 03:09:02.064
SO NUMBER ONE OBVIOUSLY IS

03:09:02.130 --> 03:09:04.066
TRYING TO CREATE THAT SORT OF

03:09:04.132 --> 03:09:06.001
ZONED ZONING AND CERTAINTY IN

03:09:06.068 --> 03:09:07.202
THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT

03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:09.171
MAKES IT THAT MAKES IT EASIER

03:09:09.237 --> 03:09:10.338
FOR CAPITAL AND INVESTORS TO TO

03:09:10.405 --> 03:09:12.774
BUILD. SO HAVING BY REIT OR

03:09:12.841 --> 03:09:15.043
MINISTERIAL APPROVALS ALLOWING

03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:16.211
FOR DENSER DEVELOPMENT, THAT

03:09:16.278 --> 03:09:17.879
CAN GET THE KIND OF ECONOMIES

03:09:17.946 --> 03:09:19.481
OF SCALE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR

03:09:19.548 --> 03:09:20.682
THAT'S SORT OF THE NECESSARY

03:09:20.749 --> 03:09:22.617
BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. OFTEN IN

03:09:22.684 --> 03:09:23.418
OUR MARKETS IN COASTAL

03:09:23.485 --> 03:09:24.219
CALIFORNIA, THE NEXT QUESTION

03:09:24.286 --> 03:09:26.188
IS HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY LOWER

03:09:26.254 --> 03:09:29.024
THE COST? SO ARE THERE

03:09:29.091 --> 03:09:30.125
OPPORTUNITIES PARTICULARLY FOR,

03:09:30.192 --> 03:09:32.027
LET'S SAY, ENTRY LEVEL HOUSING,

03:09:32.094 --> 03:09:33.128
FOR MIXED INCOME HOUSING, FOR

03:09:33.195 --> 03:09:34.696
ACCESSIBLE, ATTAINABLE

03:09:34.763 --> 03:09:36.198
HOMEOWNERSHIP, TO LOOK AT WAYS

03:09:36.264 --> 03:09:38.066
TO REDUCE IMPACT FEES, WHICH

03:09:38.133 --> 03:09:40.368
CAN BE QUITE HIGH, OR TO

03:09:40.435 --> 03:09:42.003
PROVIDE PROPERTY TAX OR WELFARE

03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:44.206
EXEMPTION TAX BENEFITS TO TO

03:09:44.272 --> 03:09:47.209
BUILDERS OF OF THIS HOUSING.

03:09:47.275 --> 03:09:48.343
NEXT, I THINK A QUESTION VERY

03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:49.377
REASONABLY THAT THIS

03:09:49.444 --> 03:09:50.612
SUBCOMMITTEE, THIS COMMITTEE

03:09:50.679 --> 03:09:52.080
SHOULD BE SHOULD BE ASKING IS

03:09:52.147 --> 03:09:53.315
ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES ALSO TO

03:09:53.381 --> 03:09:55.584
LOWER THE COST OF CAPITAL FOR

03:09:55.650 --> 03:09:58.186
BUILDERS? AND IN FACT, THERE

03:09:58.253 --> 03:09:59.955
ARE AND HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF

03:10:00.021 --> 03:10:02.190
EFFORTS TO PROVIDE CAPITAL TO

03:10:02.257 --> 03:10:03.391
MARKET RATE BUILDERS, SOMETIMES

03:10:03.458 --> 03:10:05.427
IN EXCHANGE FOR SETTING ASIDE A

03:10:05.494 --> 03:10:07.195
NUMBER OF UNITS FOR MODERATE OR

03:10:07.262 --> 03:10:09.164
LOWER INCOME HOUSING. THIS

03:10:09.231 --> 03:10:11.266
CAPITAL CAN COME AS AS HARD

03:10:11.333 --> 03:10:12.934
MONEY THAT CAN DISPLACE SOME OF

03:10:13.001 --> 03:10:14.202
WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE

03:10:14.269 --> 03:10:17.272
GIVEN BY BY EQUITY PROVIDERS.

03:10:17.339 --> 03:10:18.473
AND THEN LASTLY, ALTHOUGH

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:22.577
ISSUES LIKE INSURANCE, LABOR

03:10:22.644 --> 03:10:24.579
AVAILABILITY, THE LACK OF GOOD

03:10:24.646 --> 03:10:25.447
MANUFACTURING, AND AUTOMATED

03:10:25.514 --> 03:10:27.649
AND OFF SITE FACILITIES CAN

03:10:27.716 --> 03:10:29.151
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE OUTSIDE OF

03:10:29.217 --> 03:10:30.418
THE CONTROL OF THE STATE. IN

03:10:30.485 --> 03:10:32.053
FACT, ALL OF THESE ARE THINGS

03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:33.288
WHICH THE STATE HAS TREMENDOUS

03:10:33.355 --> 03:10:34.890
IMPACT ON. THEY CUT ACROSS AND

03:10:34.956 --> 03:10:36.391
BEYOND HOUSING. BUT THERE ARE

03:10:36.458 --> 03:10:37.425
THINGS THAT REQUIRE ACTION. SO

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:39.261
PROVIDING BETTER INSURANCE

03:10:39.327 --> 03:10:41.363
PLANS, HELPING WITH TRAINING

03:10:41.429 --> 03:10:42.497
PROGRAMS FOR FOLKS COMING OUT

03:10:42.564 --> 03:10:43.398
OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM,

03:10:43.465 --> 03:10:46.067
LOOKING AT WAYS TO INVEST INTO

03:10:46.134 --> 03:10:47.269
MANUFACTURING AND OFFSITE

03:10:47.335 --> 03:10:48.470
FACTORIES, AND INCREASE

03:10:48.537 --> 03:10:50.639
OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUTOMATION

03:10:50.705 --> 03:10:51.740
ARE THINGS THAT THE STATE IS

03:10:51.807 --> 03:10:53.275
ALREADY EXPERIMENTING IN, AND

03:10:53.341 --> 03:10:54.376
ARE CLEARLY OPPORTUNITIES THAT

03:10:54.442 --> 03:10:55.544
COULD HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT

03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:56.178
FOR OVERALL BOOSTING THE SUPPLY

03:10:56.244 --> 03:10:58.980
OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. THANK

03:10:59.047 --> 03:11:04.619
YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL

03:11:04.686 --> 03:11:06.188
RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME

03:11:06.254 --> 03:11:09.758
IS THOMAS WILSON, CEO OF CITY

03:11:09.825 --> 03:11:11.159
CONNECT PARTNERS. WE ARE A

03:11:11.226 --> 03:11:13.762
MARKET RATE HOUSING DEVELOPER.

03:11:13.829 --> 03:11:14.529
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:11:14.596 --> 03:11:16.231
CONTRIBUTE TO TODAY'S INFORMAL

03:11:16.298 --> 03:11:18.600
HEARING ON HOUSING FINANCE. I'M

03:11:18.667 --> 03:11:20.202
GOING TO SHARE SOME REAL LIFE

03:11:20.268 --> 03:11:21.870
EXPERIENCE ON WHAT WE DEAL WITH

03:11:21.937 --> 03:11:23.839
ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS ON OUR

03:11:23.905 --> 03:11:25.674
INFILL PROPERTIES. CITY CONNECT

03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:27.309
PARTNERS IS A MISSING MIDDLE

03:11:27.375 --> 03:11:29.277
DEVELOPER. OUR FOCUS IS ON

03:11:29.344 --> 03:11:30.378
INFILL PROPERTIES ACROSS

03:11:30.445 --> 03:11:32.180
CALIFORNIA. WE RANGE FROM HALF

03:11:32.247 --> 03:11:35.650
ACRE SITES UP TO 15 TO 20 ACRE

03:11:35.717 --> 03:11:36.318
COMMUNITIES. UNLIKE PUBLICLY

03:11:36.384 --> 03:11:37.686
TRADED NATIONAL BUILDERS, OUR

03:11:37.752 --> 03:11:39.254
FINANCING IS VERY DIFFERENT. WE

03:11:39.321 --> 03:11:41.523
RELY ON LOCAL BANKS, PRIVATE

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:43.124
EQUITY PROJECT LEVEL

03:11:43.191 --> 03:11:44.259
PARTNERSHIP RATHER THAN

03:11:44.326 --> 03:11:45.994
CORPORATE BALANCE SHEETS,

03:11:46.061 --> 03:11:48.296
MEANING TIMING, TIMELINES,

03:11:48.363 --> 03:11:49.497
PREDICTABILITY AND ENTITLEMENT.

03:11:49.564 --> 03:11:51.633
CERTAINTY IS THE MOST CRITICAL

03:11:51.700 --> 03:11:54.469
TO OUR DELIVERING OF HOMES. WE

03:11:54.536 --> 03:11:56.304
BELIEVE WE'RE A VITAL PIECE OF

03:11:56.371 --> 03:11:57.539
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SOLUTION,

03:11:57.606 --> 03:11:59.107
PRODUCING THE TYPES OF PROJECTS

03:11:59.174 --> 03:12:00.275
THAT INTEGRATE DIRECTLY INTO

03:12:00.342 --> 03:12:02.310
EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS, WHILE

03:12:02.377 --> 03:12:04.846
MEETING COMMUNITY BAND WITH THE

03:12:04.913 --> 03:12:06.314
ABILITY TO SCALE UP TO LARGER

03:12:06.381 --> 03:12:06.915
COMMUNITIES WHEN OPPORTUNITIES

03:12:06.982 --> 03:12:10.719
ALIGN, THE FINANCING REALITY OF

03:12:10.785 --> 03:12:12.854
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT IS IT'S

03:12:12.921 --> 03:12:14.322
CAPITAL INTENSIVE. MOST OF OUR

03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:16.458
PROJECTS REQUIRE LAND LOANS

03:12:16.524 --> 03:12:17.592
BACKED BY CONSTRUCTION LOANS

03:12:17.659 --> 03:12:19.194
WITH EQUITY PARTNERS AND OTHER

03:12:19.261 --> 03:12:21.663
LAYERS OF FINANCING. FINANCING

03:12:21.730 --> 03:12:23.198
IS NOT STATIC. CAPITAL IS GOING

03:12:23.265 --> 03:12:24.499
TO FLOW WHERE RISK AND RETURN

03:12:24.566 --> 03:12:26.701
ARE BALANCED. LENDERS EQUITY

03:12:26.768 --> 03:12:28.570
PARTNERS DEMAND CLARITY, SUCH

03:12:28.637 --> 03:12:30.538
AS TIMELINE, CLEAR RULES AND

03:12:30.605 --> 03:12:33.341
ENFORCEABLE APPROVALS WHEN THE

03:12:33.408 --> 03:12:34.609
RISK IS TOO HIGH BECAUSE OF

03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:36.411
DELAYS, LEGAL EXPOSURE OR

03:12:36.478 --> 03:12:39.047
REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY, CAPITAL

03:12:39.114 --> 03:12:41.049
WITHDRAWS AND THE PROJECTS ARE

03:12:41.116 --> 03:12:44.119
GOING TO STALL. TAKING YOU

03:12:44.185 --> 03:12:46.955
THROUGH ONE OF OUR TYPICAL

03:12:47.022 --> 03:12:48.156
PROJECTS, CITY CONNECT, IS

03:12:48.223 --> 03:12:49.758
GOING TO GO IDENTIFY THE

03:12:49.824 --> 03:12:51.326
PROJECT. WE'RE GOING TO RUN

03:12:51.393 --> 03:12:53.094
NUMEROUS FINANCIAL PROJECT

03:12:53.161 --> 03:12:54.396
PERFORMANCE, AND THEN WE'RE

03:12:54.462 --> 03:12:56.398
GOING TO MOVE INTO THE LAND

03:12:56.464 --> 03:12:57.632
ACQUISITION PHASE. WITH THE

03:12:57.699 --> 03:12:59.267
LAND ACQUISITION PHASE, THERE'S

03:12:59.334 --> 03:13:00.535
GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF LAND

03:13:00.602 --> 03:13:02.304
LOAN, USUALLY FROM A LOCAL BANK,

03:13:02.370 --> 03:13:04.706
AND THAT'S GOING TO COVER 50 TO

03:13:04.773 --> 03:13:06.074
60% OF THE PURCHASE. THE OTHER

03:13:06.141 --> 03:13:07.242
REMAINING EQUITY IS EITHER

03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:08.576
GOING TO BE SELF-FUNDED FROM

03:13:08.643 --> 03:13:10.545
OUR DEVELOPMENT COMPANY OR FROM

03:13:10.612 --> 03:13:12.147
EQUITY PARTNERS. WE THEN MOVE

03:13:12.213 --> 03:13:13.515
ON TO THE ENTITLEMENT PHASE.

03:13:13.581 --> 03:13:15.150
DURING THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS,

03:13:15.216 --> 03:13:17.252
WE ARE CARRYING THE COST OF THE

03:13:17.319 --> 03:13:19.321
ORIGINAL LAND LOAN. WE'RE

03:13:19.387 --> 03:13:21.623
ACQUIRING COSTS FROM TAXES,

03:13:21.690 --> 03:13:23.425
INSURANCE, THE HOLDING AND THE

03:13:23.491 --> 03:13:25.226
PAYMENT OF THOSE LOANS. AND

03:13:25.293 --> 03:13:27.529
THEN WE ARE TASKED WITH MAKING

03:13:27.595 --> 03:13:29.597
SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO COVER

03:13:29.664 --> 03:13:30.165
THE FULL ENTITLEMENT PACKAGE

03:13:30.231 --> 03:13:32.033
ARCHITECTS, ENGINEERS AND ALL

03:13:32.100 --> 03:13:34.035
THE CITY FEES TO GET THAT

03:13:34.102 --> 03:13:35.303
PROJECT READY TO PUT A SHOVEL

03:13:35.370 --> 03:13:38.073
ON THE GROUND. ONCE ENTITLED,

03:13:38.139 --> 03:13:39.174
WE NOW TRANSITION TO A

03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:41.743
CONSTRUCTION LOAN, TYPICALLY 65

03:13:41.810 --> 03:13:44.546
OR 75% OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE

03:13:44.612 --> 03:13:46.047
PROJECT. WE NOW NEED TO BRING

03:13:46.114 --> 03:13:48.350
IN REMAINING EQUITY INJECTION,

03:13:48.416 --> 03:13:50.485
USUALLY FROM PRIVATE EQUITY,

03:13:50.552 --> 03:13:51.653
AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A

03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:54.322
MUCH HIGHER RETURN. FINALLY, WE

03:13:54.389 --> 03:13:56.191
GET TO THE EXIT. SO NOW WE NEED

03:13:56.257 --> 03:13:57.392
TO MAKE SURE THE FOR SALE

03:13:57.459 --> 03:13:58.460
PROJECTS ARE RELIANT ON

03:13:58.526 --> 03:14:00.528
HOMEBUYERS WHO CAN QUALIFY FOR

03:14:00.595 --> 03:14:01.096
MORTGAGES AT CURRENT RATES.

03:14:01.162 --> 03:14:02.664
RENTAL PROJECTS THAT WE'VE

03:14:02.731 --> 03:14:03.531
STABILIZED AND ARE CASH FLOWING

03:14:03.598 --> 03:14:06.167
TO MEET OUR LENDER REQUIREMENTS.

03:14:06.234 --> 03:14:08.336
THIS IS A SOPHISTICATED LAYER

03:14:08.403 --> 03:14:10.105
CAPITAL STRUCTURE, MEANING THAT

03:14:10.171 --> 03:14:11.840
AT EVERY STAGE, FINANCING IS

03:14:11.906 --> 03:14:13.041
CONDITIONAL. BANK AND EQUITY

03:14:13.108 --> 03:14:14.275
PARTNERS ARE NOT GOING TO

03:14:14.342 --> 03:14:16.611
COMMIT UNLESS TIMELINES AND

03:14:16.678 --> 03:14:17.112
APPROVALS APPROVALS ARE

03:14:17.178 --> 03:14:19.414
PREDICTABLE. DELAYS ADD

03:14:19.481 --> 03:14:21.750
UNCERTAINTY, AND THAT MEANS IT

03:14:21.816 --> 03:14:22.617
THREATENS THE EQUITY STACK AT

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:26.621
ANY LEVEL. TODAY'S COST OF

03:14:26.688 --> 03:14:28.490
CAPITAL, LAND AND CONSTRUCTION

03:14:28.556 --> 03:14:30.058
LOANS ARE RUNNING IN THE EIGHT

03:14:30.125 --> 03:14:33.094
AND A HALF TO 9.5%, WITH OUR

03:14:33.161 --> 03:14:34.829
EQUITY PARTNERS DEMANDING OR

03:14:34.896 --> 03:14:38.299
EXPECTING A 15 TO 18% IRR FOR

03:14:38.366 --> 03:14:40.268
SALE REQUIRES BUYERS WHO CAN

03:14:40.335 --> 03:14:43.338
AFFORD A 6% TO 7% MORTGAGE RATE.

03:14:43.405 --> 03:14:45.407
WHEN PROJECT DELAYS OCCUR, MANY

03:14:45.473 --> 03:14:47.242
TIMES THE EQUITY STACK CANNOT

03:14:47.308 --> 03:14:49.778
AFFORD ADDITIONAL PRESSURE,

03:14:49.844 --> 03:14:51.112
SUCH AS DELAYS, AND THAT CAN

03:14:51.179 --> 03:14:55.016
CAUSE THE STACK TO CRUMBLE OR

03:14:55.083 --> 03:14:57.252
THE PROJECT TO FAIL. FOR EVERY

03:14:57.318 --> 03:14:59.454
ADDITIONAL MONTH OF DELAYS ADDS

03:14:59.521 --> 03:15:00.288
CARRYING COSTS, INTEREST,

03:15:00.355 --> 03:15:02.424
INFLATION RISK A TWO YEAR

03:15:02.490 --> 03:15:04.492
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS CAN DOUBLE

03:15:04.559 --> 03:15:05.560
FINANCING COSTS COMPARED TO A

03:15:05.627 --> 03:15:07.462
ONE YEAR PROCESS. PROJECTS THAT

03:15:07.529 --> 03:15:09.330
LOOK FEASIBLE AT THE START CAN

03:15:09.397 --> 03:15:11.032
COME BECOME INFEASIBLE BY THE

03:15:11.099 --> 03:15:13.068
TIME APPROVALS ARE SECURED.

03:15:13.134 --> 03:15:14.402
THIS IS NOT THEORY. THIS IS

03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:16.404
WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH EVERY

03:15:16.471 --> 03:15:18.139
DAY IN THE MARKET AT ITS CORE.

03:15:18.206 --> 03:15:19.407
THE MAIN SUBJECT OF MY REMARKS

03:15:19.474 --> 03:15:22.143
TODAY IS TIME. FINANCING IS

03:15:22.210 --> 03:15:24.279
ELASTIC TO MANY RISKS, BUT IT

03:15:24.345 --> 03:15:25.447
IS UNFORGIVING WHEN IT COMES TO

03:15:25.513 --> 03:15:27.182
TIME. EVERY WEEK, EVERY MONTH,

03:15:27.248 --> 03:15:29.384
THE DELAY COMPOUNDS THE COSTS.

03:15:29.451 --> 03:15:30.518
IT ERODES THE FEASIBILITY OF

03:15:30.585 --> 03:15:32.287
OUR PROJECTS TIME ALONE, NOT

03:15:32.353 --> 03:15:34.055
INTEREST RATE, NOT LAND RATE

03:15:34.122 --> 03:15:35.657
VALUES, IS OFTEN THE FACTOR

03:15:35.723 --> 03:15:37.592
THAT DETERMINES WHETHER PROJECT

03:15:37.659 --> 03:15:39.127
LIVES OR DIES. FOR DEVELOPERS

03:15:39.194 --> 03:15:41.896
LIKE US, WHO OPERATE ON INFILL

03:15:41.963 --> 03:15:42.630
LOTS WITH TIGHTER MARGIN TIME

03:15:42.697 --> 03:15:45.133
IS A MAKE OR BREAK ELEMENT.

03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:47.535
WITH THE CREATION OF NEW LAWS

03:15:47.602 --> 03:15:50.538
SUCH AS SB 1123, AB 1893,

03:15:50.605 --> 03:15:52.173
PROVISIONS IN SB 130 BUDGET

03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:54.409
TRAILER BILL, US DEVELOPERS

03:15:54.476 --> 03:15:56.311
FINALLY HAVE A SENSE OF

03:15:56.377 --> 03:15:57.512
OPTIMISM WIND AT OUR BACK THAT

03:15:57.579 --> 03:15:59.147
THE STATE HOUSING POLICIES

03:15:59.214 --> 03:16:00.949
BEGINNING TO ALIGN WITH THE

03:16:01.015 --> 03:16:01.483
REALITIES OF FINANCING AND

03:16:01.549 --> 03:16:02.617
ENTITLEMENT OF MARKET RATE

03:16:02.684 --> 03:16:05.420
UNITS. THESE COME ON TOP OF

03:16:05.487 --> 03:16:06.654
OTHER IMPORTANT STATUTES SUCH

03:16:06.721 --> 03:16:09.357
AS SB 330, SB 35 DENSITY BONUS,

03:16:09.424 --> 03:16:11.025
ALL INTENDED TO ACCELERATE

03:16:11.092 --> 03:16:12.293
HOUSING PRODUCTION AND IN MANY

03:16:12.360 --> 03:16:14.395
CASES, PROVIDING REAL TOOLS FOR

03:16:14.462 --> 03:16:16.264
US TO MOVE THE PROJECT FORWARD.

03:16:16.331 --> 03:16:18.233
THE CHALLENGE IS THAT EACH

03:16:18.299 --> 03:16:19.501
STATUTE ALSO COMES WITH CARVE

03:16:19.567 --> 03:16:22.303
OUTS. IT EXCEPTIONS AND

03:16:22.370 --> 03:16:23.505
PROCEDURAL GAPS THAT LEAVE

03:16:23.571 --> 03:16:25.573
PROJECTS VULNERABLE, CAUSING

03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:28.943
DELAYS AND DRIVING UP THE COST.

03:16:29.010 --> 03:16:31.479
FOR DEVELOPERS. THIS MEANS WE

03:16:31.546 --> 03:16:33.615
SPEND MUCH TIME RESEARCHING,

03:16:33.681 --> 03:16:35.350
BECOMING EXPERT ON THESE NEW

03:16:35.416 --> 03:16:37.719
LAWS, AND THEN WE MANAGE THE

03:16:37.785 --> 03:16:38.520
RISK AND DEFEND THE

03:16:38.586 --> 03:16:39.287
ENTITLEMENTS WHILE WE ARE

03:16:39.354 --> 03:16:40.588
TRYING TO DESIGN AND ACTUALLY

03:16:40.655 --> 03:16:42.524
BUILD THE COMMUNITIES.

03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:43.358
PREDICTABILITY AND CLARITY, NOT

03:16:43.424 --> 03:16:45.426
JUST NEW PROGRAMS ARE WHAT

03:16:45.493 --> 03:16:47.028
UNLOCK FINANCING. CAPITAL CAN

03:16:47.095 --> 03:16:49.764
ADAPT TO MOST ANY RULE, BUT

03:16:49.831 --> 03:16:51.132
WILL NOT COMMIT WHEN LAWS

03:16:51.199 --> 03:16:53.201
UNCERTAIN WHEN CARVE OUTS AND

03:16:53.268 --> 03:16:54.202
LOOPHOLES LEAVE PROJECTS

03:16:54.269 --> 03:16:58.239
EXPOSED TO LITIGATION. FOR

03:16:58.306 --> 03:17:00.208
MARKET RATE, INFILL PROJECTS IN

03:17:00.275 --> 03:17:02.277
MOST MARKET RATE BUILDERS, CEQA

03:17:02.343 --> 03:17:03.378
STILL REMAINS THE SINGLE

03:17:03.444 --> 03:17:05.246
LARGEST DRIVER OF FINANCIAL

03:17:05.313 --> 03:17:07.182
HESITATION. EVEN WITH RECENT

03:17:07.248 --> 03:17:08.816
LEGISLATIVE REFORMS, THE THREAT

03:17:08.883 --> 03:17:10.785
OF LITIGATION, PROCEDURAL

03:17:10.852 --> 03:17:12.353
DELAYS TIED TO CEQA CONTINUES

03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:14.422
TO PREVENT LENDERS FROM

03:17:14.489 --> 03:17:15.089
COMMITTING CAPITAL WITH

03:17:15.156 --> 03:17:17.725
CERTAINTY FOR BOTH BANKS AND

03:17:17.792 --> 03:17:18.860
EQUITY PARTNERS, CIVIL

03:17:18.927 --> 03:17:20.862
LITIGATION IS THE NUMBER ONE

03:17:20.929 --> 03:17:22.197
CONCERN WHEN EVALUATING WHETHER

03:17:22.263 --> 03:17:26.267
TO INVEST OR NOT. I'M GOING TO

03:17:26.334 --> 03:17:28.203
DO A CASE STUDY OF A PROJECT

03:17:28.269 --> 03:17:29.437
THAT WE HAVE ACTIVELY ENTITLED

03:17:29.504 --> 03:17:33.775
RIGHT NOW. WE ARE WE HAVE A

03:17:33.841 --> 03:17:35.176
PROJECT IN SARATOGA WE ARE

03:17:35.243 --> 03:17:36.411
WORKING THROUGH, AND WE HAVE

03:17:36.477 --> 03:17:37.345
BEEN 30 MONTHS IN THIS PROJECT.

03:17:37.412 --> 03:17:39.214
WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE

03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:40.381
ENTITLEMENTS ON THE LARGE

03:17:40.448 --> 03:17:42.083
PROJECT. WE ARE CURRENTLY

03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:43.952
CARRYING BOTH A SUBSTANTIAL

03:17:44.018 --> 03:17:44.485
LAND LOAN AND SIGNIFICANT

03:17:44.552 --> 03:17:46.788
EQUITY INVESTMENT AT THE

03:17:46.854 --> 03:17:49.691
CURRENT PROPOSAL. THE PROJECT

03:17:49.757 --> 03:17:53.394
IS 12 ACRES AND IS 231 MEDIUM

03:17:53.461 --> 03:17:55.496
DENSITY HOMES, INCLUDING 40

03:17:55.563 --> 03:17:57.832
AFFORDABLE UNITS DESIGNED AT A

03:17:57.899 --> 03:18:00.435
THREE STORY PRODUCT AT 35FT.

03:18:00.501 --> 03:18:02.337
WHEN SB 130 WAS BEING

03:18:02.403 --> 03:18:04.038
CONSIDERED, WE ANTICIPATED THIS

03:18:04.105 --> 03:18:05.673
PROJECT WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE

03:18:05.740 --> 03:18:07.642
NEW CEQA EXEMPTION. THAT

03:18:07.709 --> 03:18:08.476
PROTECTION WOULD HAVE PROVIDED

03:18:08.543 --> 03:18:10.245
THE CERTAINTY OUR FINANCIAL

03:18:10.311 --> 03:18:12.413
FINANCING PARTNERS REQUIRE.

03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:13.548
HOWEVER, UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE

03:18:13.615 --> 03:18:15.750
FINAL LANGUAGE, A CARVE OUT

03:18:15.817 --> 03:18:16.751
EXCLUDED THE BUILDERS REMEDY

03:18:16.818 --> 03:18:18.186
PROJECT OVER FIVE ACRES. AS A

03:18:18.253 --> 03:18:20.321
RESULT, THIS PROJECT IS NOW

03:18:20.388 --> 03:18:22.423
SUBJECT TO CEQA CHALLENGES.

03:18:22.490 --> 03:18:25.693
BECAUSE OF THIS, OUR PARTNERS

03:18:25.760 --> 03:18:26.327
HAVE ASKED US TO REEVALUATE HOW

03:18:26.394 --> 03:18:28.363
TO MOVE THIS PROJECT FORWARD.

03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:30.031
IN PRACTICE, THIS MEANS

03:18:30.098 --> 03:18:32.200
REDUCING THE NUMBERS OF HOMES,

03:18:32.267 --> 03:18:33.501
NOT BECAUSE THE SITE CAN'T

03:18:33.568 --> 03:18:35.036
HANDLE MORE, BUT BECAUSE FEWER

03:18:35.103 --> 03:18:36.271
UNITS CAN REDUCE ENTITLEMENT

03:18:36.337 --> 03:18:37.305
REQUIREMENTS AND LOWER

03:18:37.372 --> 03:18:39.140
LITIGATION RISK, ALLOWING US TO

03:18:39.207 --> 03:18:41.242
MOVE THE PROCESS FASTER WITH

03:18:41.309 --> 03:18:43.444
OUR EQUITY PARTNERS. THIS IS

03:18:43.511 --> 03:18:45.313
THE REALITY DEVELOPERS FACE. TO

03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:47.348
KEEP FINANCING INTACT, WE CUT

03:18:47.415 --> 03:18:49.150
BACK ON WHAT WE COULD BUILD

03:18:49.217 --> 03:18:51.319
SIMPLY TO PROTECT TIME. THE

03:18:51.386 --> 03:18:52.620
TRADE OFF HAPPENS AGAIN AND

03:18:52.687 --> 03:18:54.589
AGAIN ACROSS CALIFORNIA, AND IS

03:18:54.656 --> 03:18:56.924
DIRECTLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF

03:18:56.991 --> 03:18:57.959
HOUSING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

03:18:58.026 --> 03:19:01.929
DELIVER AND PRODUCE. SO IN

03:19:01.996 --> 03:19:04.198
CLOSING, WHAT I'D LIKE TO JUST

03:19:04.265 --> 03:19:06.000
SAY IS THE BARRIER, THE BARRIER

03:19:06.067 --> 03:19:08.069
TO HOUSING PRODUCTION IS NOT

03:19:08.136 --> 03:19:10.705
THE LACK OF LAND. IT'S NOT THE

03:19:10.772 --> 03:19:11.539
LACK OF WILL. IT'S THE

03:19:11.606 --> 03:19:13.708
FINANCING ENVIRONMENT CREATED

03:19:13.775 --> 03:19:16.044
BY THE LAYERS OF LAW AND THE

03:19:16.110 --> 03:19:17.612
UNPREDICTABILITY OF TIME IN

03:19:17.679 --> 03:19:21.916
CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GREAT.

03:19:21.983 --> 03:19:24.419
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'LL BRING

03:19:24.485 --> 03:19:26.254
IT BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE AND SEE

03:19:26.321 --> 03:19:28.189
IF THERE'S ANY FOLLOW UP

03:19:28.256 --> 03:19:30.158
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU TO BOTH OF

03:19:30.224 --> 03:19:32.327
YOU. AGAIN, SUPER HELPFUL AND

03:19:32.393 --> 03:19:34.562
AND REALLY HELPS US, YOU KNOW

03:19:34.629 --> 03:19:37.265
HAVE A AN ANCHORING. AND AND

03:19:37.332 --> 03:19:39.100
THIS SIDE OF THE DEVELOPMENT

03:19:39.167 --> 03:19:40.268
QUESTION ON MARKET RATE. AND

03:19:40.335 --> 03:19:42.503
YOU KNOW WE BOTH COME FROM

03:19:42.570 --> 03:19:46.007
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I SAW A

03:19:46.074 --> 03:19:47.475
LOT OF BUILDING HAPPENING AS A

03:19:47.542 --> 03:19:48.376
LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. AND

03:19:48.443 --> 03:19:50.511
I'VE SEEN IT IN MANY DIFFERENT

03:19:50.578 --> 03:19:52.580
CAPACITIES. I MEAN, TO ME, I'LL

03:19:52.647 --> 03:19:54.182
GO BACK TO COMMENTS I MADE WITH

03:19:54.248 --> 03:19:56.150
THE PREVIOUS PANEL. IT STILL,

03:19:56.217 --> 03:19:59.020
IT SEEMS LIKE A MATH PROBLEM.

03:19:59.087 --> 03:20:00.421
AND YOUR PRESENTATION MADE THAT

03:20:00.488 --> 03:20:03.224
EXTREMELY CLEAR, AND YOUR

03:20:03.291 --> 03:20:04.459
TESTIMONY MAKES IT EXTREMELY

03:20:04.525 --> 03:20:07.228
CLEAR. AND THE MATH IS TIED UP

03:20:07.295 --> 03:20:09.430
IN LITIGATION, DELAYS, ETC. BUT,

03:20:09.497 --> 03:20:12.266
YOU KNOW, I GUESS I GUESS THE

03:20:12.333 --> 03:20:16.637
QUESTION IS, YOU KNOW, WHAT

03:20:16.704 --> 03:20:18.373
SEEMS LIKE WE'RE TAKING CARE OF

03:20:18.439 --> 03:20:21.376
A BIG PIECE OR, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

03:20:21.442 --> 03:20:23.745
TRYING TO TAKE A BIG PIECE OF

03:20:23.811 --> 03:20:25.246
THE SEQUA INFILL QUESTION OFF

03:20:25.313 --> 03:20:27.048
THE TABLE AND MAKE IT LESS

03:20:27.115 --> 03:20:30.651
RISKY TO DO THIS. BUT I GUESS

03:20:30.718 --> 03:20:32.420
THE BIG QUESTION I HAVE IS,

03:20:32.487 --> 03:20:36.324
HAVE YOU SEEN. HAVE YOU SEEN

03:20:36.391 --> 03:20:38.359
ACTUAL IN THE MARKET? AND THIS

03:20:38.426 --> 03:20:40.361
PROBABLY GOES TO MR. METCALFE

03:20:40.428 --> 03:20:42.630
MORE EVEN WITH ALL THE REFORMS

03:20:42.697 --> 03:20:44.399
WE'VE DONE, YOU KNOW, 100 BILLS

03:20:44.465 --> 03:20:46.167
IN THE LAST HOW MANY YEARS DID

03:20:46.234 --> 03:20:48.202
YOU SAY? LESS THAN A DECADE, I

03:20:48.269 --> 03:20:50.271
THINK IS WHAT I HEARD. HAVE WE

03:20:50.338 --> 03:20:52.173
SEEN ACTUAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF

03:20:52.240 --> 03:20:54.742
THAT? IN OTHER WORDS, HAS

03:20:54.809 --> 03:20:56.310
HOUSING RELATIVELY SPEAKING,

03:20:56.377 --> 03:20:58.646
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE

03:20:58.713 --> 03:20:59.280
COUNTERFACTUAL WOULD BE. BUT IS

03:20:59.347 --> 03:21:00.348
HOUSING BECOMING MORE

03:21:00.415 --> 03:21:02.617
AFFORDABLE? WE OBVIOUSLY ARE

03:21:02.683 --> 03:21:04.218
WELL BEHIND ON THE AMOUNT OF

03:21:04.285 --> 03:21:06.254
UNITS WE NEED, BUT HAVE WE

03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:08.089
ACTUALLY SEEN HOUSING

03:21:08.156 --> 03:21:10.458
AFFORDABILITY BE IMPACTED BY

03:21:10.525 --> 03:21:12.760
THE HOUSING BILLS THAT WE'VE

03:21:12.827 --> 03:21:17.698
DONE? NO, NOT PARTICULARLY IN A

03:21:17.765 --> 03:21:19.534
PARTICULARLY COMPELLING WAY.

03:21:19.600 --> 03:21:21.302
AFFORDABILITY IS GENERALLY

03:21:21.369 --> 03:21:23.137
WORSE NOW THAN IT WAS, LET'S

03:21:23.204 --> 03:21:25.673
SAY, SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN THIS

03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:26.574
WAVE OF HOUSING LEGISLATION

03:21:26.641 --> 03:21:28.676
STARTED. I THINK, WHERE YOU CAN

03:21:28.743 --> 03:21:32.079
VERY VISIBLY SEE PROGRESS, AND

03:21:32.146 --> 03:21:33.448
WHICH SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING

03:21:33.514 --> 03:21:35.416
BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS THAT YOU

03:21:35.483 --> 03:21:37.151
CAN HAVE IMPACT WHEN YOU DO IT

03:21:37.218 --> 03:21:39.687
WELL OR JUST TWO PLACES. ONE IS

03:21:39.754 --> 03:21:40.221
IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSE,

03:21:40.288 --> 03:21:41.889
SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:21:41.956 --> 03:21:43.491
SPACE, WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF

03:21:43.558 --> 03:21:45.126
THROWING A LOT OF MONEY AT IT,

03:21:45.193 --> 03:21:47.462
BUT ALSO BUILDING A WHOLE SET

03:21:47.528 --> 03:21:49.197
OF LAWS THAT ARE VERY

03:21:49.263 --> 03:21:51.599
FACILITATIVE OF DEED RESTRICTED

03:21:51.666 --> 03:21:52.500
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO WHEN YOU

03:21:52.567 --> 03:21:54.202
LOOK AT THINGS LIKE SENATE BILL

03:21:54.268 --> 03:21:56.437
35 OR STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW,

03:21:56.504 --> 03:21:57.872
ALTHOUGH THEY CAN IN THEORY BE

03:21:57.939 --> 03:21:59.440
USED BY MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS,

03:21:59.507 --> 03:22:00.274
IN PRACTICE, THEY'RE

03:22:00.341 --> 03:22:01.309
OVERWHELMINGLY BEING USED BY

03:22:01.375 --> 03:22:01.876
AFFORDABLE BUILDERS BECAUSE

03:22:01.943 --> 03:22:04.579
THEY TEND TO BRING WITH THEM

03:22:04.645 --> 03:22:05.646
REQUIREMENTS LIKE PREVAILING

03:22:05.713 --> 03:22:06.447
WAGE OR AFFORDABILITY, WHICH

03:22:06.514 --> 03:22:08.082
DOESN'T DON'T WORK FOR MARKET

03:22:08.149 --> 03:22:09.383
RATE BUILDERS. SO WE'VE SEEN A

03:22:09.450 --> 03:22:11.419
DOUBLING OF PERMITS IN THAT

03:22:11.486 --> 03:22:12.286
AREA. THE OTHER EXAMPLE IS

03:22:12.353 --> 03:22:14.255
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, RIGHT.

03:22:14.322 --> 03:22:15.122
MENTIONED EARLIER WHERE WE'VE

03:22:15.189 --> 03:22:19.260
SEEN. YOU KNOW, GOING FOR 500

03:22:19.327 --> 03:22:21.162
UNITS A DECADE AGO TO MAYBE 25

03:22:21.229 --> 03:22:23.297
OR 30,000 UNITS TODAY. AND I

03:22:23.364 --> 03:22:24.499
THINK THE STORY THERE IS

03:22:24.565 --> 03:22:25.633
ACTUALLY QUITE SIMILAR. LIKE

03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:27.235
WHAT HAS THE STATE DONE? WELL,

03:22:27.301 --> 03:22:28.302
IT'S PROVIDED INCREDIBLE

03:22:28.369 --> 03:22:29.570
CERTAINTY. IF I'M A HOMEOWNER

03:22:29.637 --> 03:22:31.272
TODAY, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I

03:22:31.339 --> 03:22:33.474
CAN BUILD, AND I KNOW MY LOCAL

03:22:33.541 --> 03:22:34.575
GOVERNMENT HAS TO GIVE ME THE

03:22:34.642 --> 03:22:36.310
PERMIT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. AS

03:22:36.377 --> 03:22:38.379
LONG AS I CHECK THE BOX ON

03:22:38.446 --> 03:22:39.146
HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES. SO

03:22:39.213 --> 03:22:40.214
YOU'VE YOU'VE ELIMINATED FOR

03:22:40.281 --> 03:22:41.716
BOTH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

03:22:41.782 --> 03:22:43.317
ADUS, TIME DELAYS, UNCERTAINTY.

03:22:43.384 --> 03:22:46.521
AND YOU PROVIDED A LARGE AND

03:22:46.587 --> 03:22:48.456
VERY FAVORABLE ZONING ENVELOPE.

03:22:48.523 --> 03:22:50.491
YEAH. YOU KNOW, GOING BACK TO

03:22:50.558 --> 03:22:52.159
WHAT I SAID BEFORE, IT SEEMS

03:22:52.226 --> 03:22:54.161
LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S LAND,

03:22:54.228 --> 03:22:56.764
LABOR, THE MARKET RATE SIDE,

03:22:56.831 --> 03:22:59.534
IT'S BUYER. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I

03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:00.434
THINK THAT WE'VE SEEN

03:23:00.501 --> 03:23:01.168
HISTORICALLY AND I THINK A LOT

03:23:01.235 --> 03:23:03.137
OF THE LITERATURE SPELLS OUT

03:23:03.204 --> 03:23:05.072
THAT WHY HOUSING IS SO

03:23:05.139 --> 03:23:06.574
EXPENSIVE IS, OVER THE PAST

03:23:06.641 --> 03:23:08.209
DECADE OR MORE, CORPORATE

03:23:08.276 --> 03:23:10.378
INVESTMENT HAS BECOME

03:23:10.444 --> 03:23:12.580
INCREASING, INCREASINGLY

03:23:12.647 --> 03:23:13.714
PREVALENT IN MANY OF OUR

03:23:13.781 --> 03:23:15.516
COMMUNITIES. IN R1 AND R2 AND

03:23:15.583 --> 03:23:18.419
R3 HOUSING. RIGHT. IT'S IT'S

03:23:18.486 --> 03:23:20.288
VIEWED NOW AS AND IT HAS BEEN

03:23:20.354 --> 03:23:23.758
SINCE, YOU KNOW, 2008, 2009 HAS

03:23:23.824 --> 03:23:25.159
BEEN A MAJOR ALTERNATIVE

03:23:25.226 --> 03:23:26.494
INVESTMENT CLASS FOR MONEY THAT

03:23:26.561 --> 03:23:28.095
WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY THERE. AND

03:23:28.162 --> 03:23:30.565
THAT OBVIOUSLY DRIVES UP COSTS.

03:23:30.631 --> 03:23:32.300
IF YOU HAVE CORPORATE BUYERS,

03:23:32.366 --> 03:23:36.304
YOU KNOW, CONSUMING THE SUPPLY

03:23:36.370 --> 03:23:39.307
AND DRIVING UP THE COST OF EACH

03:23:39.373 --> 03:23:41.442
UNIT, IT'S JUST GOING TO THAT

03:23:41.509 --> 03:23:43.344
SNOWBALLS. AND YOU ALSO SEE

03:23:43.411 --> 03:23:46.047
OVERSEAS BUYERS THAT ARE MORE

03:23:46.113 --> 03:23:49.350
AND MORE AFFECTING TRANSACTIONS

03:23:49.417 --> 03:23:51.218
THAT WERE THE MIDDLE MARKET,

03:23:51.285 --> 03:23:53.187
ESPECIALLY WHERE FAMILIES COULD

03:23:53.254 --> 03:23:54.555
BE BUYING THAT. YOU'RE SEEING

03:23:54.622 --> 03:23:58.292
JUST INVESTORS THAT THAT BUY IT

03:23:58.359 --> 03:24:00.027
AND USE IT AS A AS A RENTAL

03:24:00.094 --> 03:24:02.330
INCOME. SO CAN WE AS A STATE.

03:24:02.396 --> 03:24:04.098
AND I'M ASKING THIS BECAUSE WE

03:24:04.165 --> 03:24:06.334
HAVEN'T DONE A LOT. THERE'S

03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:07.435
SOME FOLKS THAT WERE HERE

03:24:07.501 --> 03:24:08.569
EARLIER THAT HAVE PROPOSED

03:24:08.636 --> 03:24:10.371
LEGISLATION AND LAWS ABOUT HOW

03:24:10.438 --> 03:24:11.639
TO DEAL. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

03:24:11.706 --> 03:24:13.407
LAND, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LABOR.

03:24:13.474 --> 03:24:15.309
NOW IT'S LIKE, HOW DO WE TRY TO

03:24:15.376 --> 03:24:16.510
LEGISLATE OR REGULATE THE

03:24:16.577 --> 03:24:18.312
BUYING SIDE OF IT? AND THAT'S

03:24:18.379 --> 03:24:20.715
REALLY HARD BECAUSE OF THE

03:24:20.781 --> 03:24:22.116
SYSTEM THAT WE LIVE IN,

03:24:22.183 --> 03:24:24.552
CAPITALISM. AND THERE ARE

03:24:24.619 --> 03:24:26.988
REALLY INTRICATE PROTECTIONS

03:24:27.054 --> 03:24:30.658
ABOUT TRYING TO PROTECT AGAINST

03:24:30.725 --> 03:24:34.328
NOT LIMITING THE CORPORATE FORM

03:24:34.395 --> 03:24:35.496
OR THE NON-CORPORATE FORM THAT

03:24:35.563 --> 03:24:37.465
YOU CAN ACTUALLY INVEST IN REAL

03:24:37.531 --> 03:24:39.634
ESTATE. SO ARE THERE THINGS

03:24:39.700 --> 03:24:41.469
THAT YOU THINK WE CAN DO TO

03:24:41.535 --> 03:24:42.269
ACTUALLY HELP WITH THAT? AND I

03:24:42.336 --> 03:24:45.039
KNOW AS A DEVELOPER THAT MIGHT

03:24:45.106 --> 03:24:46.207
ACTUALLY BE COUNTERINTUITIVE,

03:24:46.273 --> 03:24:48.309
BECAUSE YOU WANT THAT PRICE TO

03:24:48.376 --> 03:24:50.077
BE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE OR ELSE

03:24:50.144 --> 03:24:51.178
IT DOESN'T PENCIL OUT. RIGHT.

03:24:51.245 --> 03:24:52.513
AS A DEVELOPER, THAT SOUNDS

03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:53.614
SCARY. WHAT WHAT WOULD BE

03:24:53.681 --> 03:24:55.282
BETTER IS TO GET MORE UNITS AND

03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:56.617
GET THE DEVELOPERS THAT HAVE

03:24:56.684 --> 03:24:58.519
THESE PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE

03:24:58.586 --> 03:24:59.387
TO ACTUALLY GET A SHOVEL IN THE

03:24:59.453 --> 03:25:01.355
GROUND. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE

03:25:01.422 --> 03:25:02.823
A STUDY DONE ON HOW MANY

03:25:02.890 --> 03:25:03.524
PROJECTS ARE ACTUALLY SITTING

03:25:03.591 --> 03:25:05.326
THERE UTILIZING SB 1123,

03:25:05.393 --> 03:25:06.227
UTILIZING BUILDERS REMEDY THAT

03:25:06.293 --> 03:25:08.162
ARE JUST WORKING THROUGH THE

03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:09.463
SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW. OUR COMPANY

03:25:09.530 --> 03:25:12.466
ALONE HAS 11 PROJECTS THAT IT'S

03:25:12.533 --> 03:25:14.402
JUST MOVING VERY SLOW, EVEN

03:25:14.468 --> 03:25:15.970
THOUGH WE HAVE ALL THESE

03:25:16.037 --> 03:25:18.239
AMAZING NEW TOOLS IN OUR

03:25:18.305 --> 03:25:20.341
TOOLBOX, WE STILL CAN'T GET

03:25:20.408 --> 03:25:21.208
THEM TO THE FINISH LINE. AND

03:25:21.275 --> 03:25:23.277
SOME OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE

03:25:23.344 --> 03:25:24.545
BEEN GOING ON FOR THREE YEARS.

03:25:24.612 --> 03:25:26.247
AND SO AND WE'RE STILL ACTIVELY

03:25:26.313 --> 03:25:27.748
RIGHT NOW FOR THE INFILL

03:25:27.815 --> 03:25:29.450
PROJECTS, WE CAN MAKE A LOT OF

03:25:29.517 --> 03:25:32.219
THESE PENCIL AND WE CAN DELIVER

03:25:32.286 --> 03:25:35.589
PROPERTIES THAT ARE AT A MUCH,

03:25:35.656 --> 03:25:37.425
MUCH LOWER ENTRY LEVEL.

03:25:37.491 --> 03:25:38.092
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT

03:25:38.159 --> 03:25:39.794
AFFORDABLE, BUT THEY'RE ALSO

03:25:39.860 --> 03:25:41.495
NOT $3 MILLION HOMES. AND SO

03:25:41.562 --> 03:25:43.631
AND THAT MAKES OUR OUR PROJECTS

03:25:43.698 --> 03:25:45.232
PENCIL. BUT WE CANNOT GET THE

03:25:45.299 --> 03:25:46.300
CITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES TO

03:25:46.367 --> 03:25:47.668
MOVE QUICKLY. THEY JUST SIT ON

03:25:47.735 --> 03:25:49.603
THEIR HANDS AND THEY WILL USE

03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:51.505
EVERY STOP THEY CAN TO SLOW US

03:25:51.572 --> 03:25:54.375
DOWN. IT'S A FACT. AND I'LL SAY,

03:25:54.442 --> 03:25:56.477
I MEAN, THERE IS A LARGE AND

03:25:56.544 --> 03:25:57.278
OVERWHELMING BODY OF RESEARCH

03:25:57.344 --> 03:25:58.412
AND EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT

03:25:58.479 --> 03:26:01.382
THE PRIMARY DRIVER ON OUR

03:26:01.449 --> 03:26:02.616
INCREASED COST AND DECREASED

03:26:02.683 --> 03:26:04.285
AFFORDABILITY IN THE STATE AND

03:26:04.351 --> 03:26:05.986
EVERYWHERE IS A LACK OF HOUSING

03:26:06.053 --> 03:26:08.422
SUPPLY. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:26:08.489 --> 03:26:09.323
WE HAVE MORE HOMES AVAILABLE

03:26:09.390 --> 03:26:11.125
FOR PEOPLE, IT PROVIDES MORE

03:26:11.192 --> 03:26:12.426
CHOICES. IT LOWERS, STABILIZES

03:26:12.493 --> 03:26:14.595
OR LOWERS PRICES. SO I THINK WE

03:26:14.662 --> 03:26:17.765
WANT TO BE CAREFUL. WE WANT TO

03:26:17.832 --> 03:26:18.499
BE CAREFUL IN THESE

03:26:18.566 --> 03:26:19.233
CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE WE DO

03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:21.368
NEED FOR BUILDERS TO BE ABLE TO

03:26:21.435 --> 03:26:23.404
BUILD. THEY DO NEED ACCESS TO

03:26:23.471 --> 03:26:24.004
INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL, RIGHT?

03:26:24.071 --> 03:26:25.339
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

03:26:25.406 --> 03:26:27.041
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME AND

03:26:27.108 --> 03:26:28.042
INVEST THEIR DOLLARS INTO

03:26:28.109 --> 03:26:29.076
CALIFORNIA IN THE RESIDENTIAL

03:26:29.143 --> 03:26:30.411
SPACE. AND SO I THINK YOU WANT

03:26:30.478 --> 03:26:31.545
TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

03:26:31.612 --> 03:26:32.913
DISCOURAGING THOSE CAPITAL

03:26:32.980 --> 03:26:34.115
FLOWS, BECAUSE YOU COULD END UP

03:26:34.181 --> 03:26:35.583
REMOVING THE INVESTMENT MONEY

03:26:35.649 --> 03:26:36.584
THAT'S NECESSARY TO ADD TO THAT

03:26:36.650 --> 03:26:38.152
SUPPLY. I THINK THE OTHER THING

03:26:38.219 --> 03:26:40.121
WAS JUST I MEAN, IT'S A WEIRD

03:26:40.187 --> 03:26:40.955
SITUATION. I UNDERSTAND THE

03:26:41.021 --> 03:26:43.224
FRUSTRATION WHEN YOU SEE

03:26:43.290 --> 03:26:45.292
CORPORATE BUYERS BUY SINGLE

03:26:45.359 --> 03:26:46.427
FAMILY HOMES THAT SHOULD

03:26:46.494 --> 03:26:47.361
OTHERWISE GO FOR SINGLE FAMILY

03:26:47.428 --> 03:26:49.630
HOME OWNERSHIP. I THINK IT'S

03:26:49.697 --> 03:26:51.532
TAKING AWAY A FAMILY'S CHANCE

03:26:51.599 --> 03:26:53.234
AT REALIZING THE AMERICAN DREAM

03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:55.035
AND ACCESSING, YOU KNOW, HAVING

03:26:55.102 --> 03:26:56.437
A HOME OF THEIR OWN THAT THEY

03:26:56.504 --> 03:26:58.472
BUY AND SAVE AND SAVING AND SO

03:26:58.539 --> 03:27:00.074
ON AND SO FORTH. BUT THOSE

03:27:00.141 --> 03:27:01.308
HOMES DON'T TYPICALLY SIT EMPTY

03:27:01.375 --> 03:27:03.010
WHERE WHAT THEY'RE USUALLY

03:27:03.077 --> 03:27:03.577
HAPPENING IS THEY'RE GETTING

03:27:03.644 --> 03:27:04.078
TURNED INTO RENTAL

03:27:04.145 --> 03:27:05.479
OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH ARE BEING

03:27:05.546 --> 03:27:06.347
MADE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO

03:27:06.413 --> 03:27:07.281
DON'T HAVE OPPORTUNITIES

03:27:07.348 --> 03:27:08.182
OTHERWISE TO RENT A HOME. AND

03:27:08.249 --> 03:27:10.117
THEY CAN'T DON'T OTHERWISE HAVE

03:27:10.184 --> 03:27:11.252
PERFECTED MORTGAGE CREDIT

03:27:11.318 --> 03:27:12.787
SCORES THAT ENABLE THEM TO BUY

03:27:12.853 --> 03:27:14.688
A HOUSE. AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU

03:27:14.755 --> 03:27:16.323
SEE EVEN SINGLE FAMILY RENT,

03:27:16.390 --> 03:27:18.025
LIKE WHOLE SINGLE FAMILY RENT

03:27:18.092 --> 03:27:19.360
COMMUNITIES BEING BUILT FROM

03:27:19.426 --> 03:27:21.562
SCRATCH, IT'S NOT AS IF THAT'S

03:27:21.629 --> 03:27:23.197
COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF FOR

03:27:23.264 --> 03:27:25.432
SALE PROPERTIES. THE FOR SALE

03:27:25.499 --> 03:27:26.066
PROPERTIES AREN'T PENCILING. SO

03:27:26.133 --> 03:27:28.269
IT'S A QUESTION OF DO WE WANT

03:27:28.335 --> 03:27:29.603
INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL TO COME

03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:30.504
IN AND CREATE NEW RENTAL

03:27:30.571 --> 03:27:32.139
OPPORTUNITIES, OR DO WE WANT TO

03:27:32.206 --> 03:27:33.707
SEE DEVELOPABLE LAND SITTING

03:27:33.774 --> 03:27:35.442
FALLOW. SO LIKE NOT EASY TRADE

03:27:35.509 --> 03:27:38.579
OFFS. BUT I THINK WE YEAH. TO

03:27:38.646 --> 03:27:39.480
YOUR POINT, I THINK WE NEED TO

03:27:39.547 --> 03:27:41.248
STAY FOCUSED AS A STATE ON HOW

03:27:41.315 --> 03:27:43.384
DO WE LIFT ALL BOATS, HOW DO WE

03:27:43.450 --> 03:27:44.418
CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL

03:27:44.485 --> 03:27:46.554
KINDS OF HOUSING TO GET BUILT?

03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:47.488
YEAH. AND I DO THINK IT SEEMS

03:27:47.555 --> 03:27:49.190
LIKE YOU COULD DO BOTH. I MEAN,

03:27:49.256 --> 03:27:51.292
I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EITHER OR,

03:27:51.358 --> 03:27:52.526
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FALSE

03:27:52.593 --> 03:27:54.528
CHOICE, RIGHT? I MEAN, I DON'T

03:27:54.595 --> 03:27:56.330
THINK THAT YOU CAN NOT HAVE

03:27:56.397 --> 03:27:58.132
MORE SUPPLY BEING BUILT AND

03:27:58.199 --> 03:28:01.268
ALSO NOT LIMIT THE TYPE OF

03:28:01.335 --> 03:28:03.237
BUYER THAT IS ACTUALLY BUYING A

03:28:03.304 --> 03:28:05.406
LOT OF THESE NEW UNITS. AND SO

03:28:05.472 --> 03:28:08.142
I GUESS MY MY RESPONSE TO THAT

03:28:08.209 --> 03:28:09.510
IS WE OBVIOUSLY WANT PRIVATE

03:28:09.577 --> 03:28:11.512
CAPITAL COMING IN TO HELP BUILD

03:28:11.579 --> 03:28:13.147
THESE UNITS, BUT WE WANT THESE

03:28:13.214 --> 03:28:14.815
UNITS GOING TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE

03:28:14.882 --> 03:28:17.151
IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND I

03:28:17.218 --> 03:28:19.653
THINK THAT OWNERSHIP IS VERY

03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:20.254
DIFFERENT THAN RENTING. WE'VE

03:28:20.321 --> 03:28:22.356
HAD THIS DEBATE ON THE FLOOR IN

03:28:22.423 --> 03:28:25.359
COMMITTEE A LOT. YEAH, I THINK

03:28:25.426 --> 03:28:26.560
FAMILIES NEED RENTALS TOO. BUT

03:28:26.627 --> 03:28:28.362
GENERATIONAL WEALTH AND REALLY

03:28:28.429 --> 03:28:30.064
THE STORY OF AMERICA HAS BEEN

03:28:30.130 --> 03:28:31.332
HOMEOWNERSHIP. AT LEAST THAT'S

03:28:31.398 --> 03:28:33.767
WHAT WE SELL. AND FRANKLY, YOU

03:28:33.834 --> 03:28:35.102
KNOW, A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES ARE

03:28:35.169 --> 03:28:36.470
WHERE THEY ARE, PROBABLY

03:28:36.537 --> 03:28:37.838
BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO GET

03:28:37.905 --> 03:28:39.240
INTO A HOME DECADES AGO. AND SO

03:28:39.306 --> 03:28:41.242
IF WE STILL BELIEVE IN THAT,

03:28:41.308 --> 03:28:43.210
AND I THINK A LOT OF US DO,

03:28:43.277 --> 03:28:44.378
WELL, THEN I DO THINK THAT MY

03:28:44.445 --> 03:28:45.579
PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WERE

03:28:45.646 --> 03:28:47.314
NOT COMPETING AGAINST CORPORATE

03:28:47.381 --> 03:28:48.249
BUYERS TO BUY A HOUSE IN MY

03:28:48.315 --> 03:28:50.584
COMMUNITY. THAT WASN'T A

03:28:50.651 --> 03:28:51.352
DYNAMIC THAT THEY WERE UP

03:28:51.418 --> 03:28:54.188
AGAINST FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS.

03:28:54.255 --> 03:28:55.422
THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE

03:28:55.489 --> 03:28:58.158
PREVALENT, AND I GUESS I WILL I

03:28:58.225 --> 03:29:00.394
WILL NOT, YOU KNOW, I WILL NOT

03:29:00.461 --> 03:29:02.263
BUY THE THE GIVEN THAT SOMEHOW

03:29:02.329 --> 03:29:05.366
THAT IS HELPING EVERYONE TO

03:29:05.432 --> 03:29:07.167
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. AND SO I

03:29:07.234 --> 03:29:09.303
THINK YOU CAN YOU CAN BUILD AND

03:29:09.370 --> 03:29:10.604
ALSO ALLOW PEOPLE WHEN THOSE

03:29:10.671 --> 03:29:12.373
UNITS ARE BUILT TO BUY THEM

03:29:12.439 --> 03:29:13.440
THAT ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE

03:29:13.507 --> 03:29:15.142
COMMUNITY. SO, YOU KNOW, I DO

03:29:15.209 --> 03:29:17.611
THINK THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE

03:29:17.678 --> 03:29:18.913
THAT DOESN'T GET ENOUGH

03:29:18.979 --> 03:29:19.413
ATTENTION. I THINK IT IS

03:29:19.480 --> 03:29:21.582
CONTROVERSIAL. BUT AS A

03:29:21.649 --> 03:29:22.449
DEVELOPER, YEAH, THAT'S NOT

03:29:22.516 --> 03:29:24.084
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

03:29:24.151 --> 03:29:26.620
WANT TO HEAR. BUT I DO THINK

03:29:26.687 --> 03:29:27.454
THAT IT'S ALSO DRIVING UP COSTS,

03:29:27.521 --> 03:29:30.190
RIGHT? SO AS A DEVELOPER, LIKE

03:29:30.257 --> 03:29:31.525
IT IS MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE

03:29:31.592 --> 03:29:33.093
FOR YOU TO BUILD WHEN

03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:34.795
EVERYTHING IS BECOMING MORE

03:29:34.862 --> 03:29:37.064
EXPENSIVE, THE LAND, THE, THE

03:29:37.131 --> 03:29:39.400
COST OF LABOR, THE MATERIALS,

03:29:39.466 --> 03:29:41.468
BECAUSE THE THE END PRODUCT,

03:29:41.535 --> 03:29:43.237
THERE IS SO MUCH DEMAND FROM,

03:29:43.304 --> 03:29:44.471
FROM AN INVESTMENT STANDPOINT,

03:29:44.538 --> 03:29:45.973
NOT FROM LIKE A LIVABILITY

03:29:46.040 --> 03:29:48.342
STANDPOINT OF FAMILIES. SO I DO

03:29:48.409 --> 03:29:49.476
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ON

03:29:49.543 --> 03:29:52.179
THE MARKET RATE AND I CAN GO

03:29:52.246 --> 03:29:53.514
BACK TO A LOT OF STUDIES THAT

03:29:53.580 --> 03:29:55.316
I'VE READ THAT IN THE CITIES

03:29:55.382 --> 03:29:57.217
AND URBAN AREAS WHERE WE'VE

03:29:57.284 --> 03:29:58.352
BUILT THE MOST HOUSING, WE'VE

03:29:58.419 --> 03:30:00.054
SEEN THE MOST INCREASES IN

03:30:00.120 --> 03:30:01.655
PRICES. WE'VE BUILT A LOT OF

03:30:01.722 --> 03:30:03.290
HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE'VE

03:30:03.357 --> 03:30:04.191
BEEN WE'VE BUILT A LOT OF

03:30:04.258 --> 03:30:06.226
HOUSING IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES,

03:30:06.293 --> 03:30:08.696
MUCH OF WHICH IS SITTING EMPTY

03:30:08.762 --> 03:30:10.030
RIGHT NOW AND IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

03:30:10.097 --> 03:30:12.499
SO I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK

03:30:12.566 --> 03:30:14.435
THE DATA IS TOTALLY CLEAR ON

03:30:14.501 --> 03:30:16.370
SOMEHOW JUST UNLEASHING SUPPLY

03:30:16.437 --> 03:30:17.504
IS GOING TO HELP

03:30:17.571 --> 03:30:18.238
UNAFFORDABILITY. AND THAT'S

03:30:18.305 --> 03:30:19.340
REALLY WHY THIS SELECT

03:30:19.406 --> 03:30:21.742
COMMITTEE IS HERE, IS LIKE, HOW

03:30:21.809 --> 03:30:22.276
DO YOU GET MORE AFFORDABLE

03:30:22.343 --> 03:30:24.345
HOUSING? WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT

03:30:24.411 --> 03:30:26.347
MORE HOUSING AT THE EXPENSE OF

03:30:26.413 --> 03:30:27.147
AFFORDABILITY. WHAT WE'VE SEEN

03:30:27.214 --> 03:30:30.317
IS A LOT OF REFORMS THAT ALLOW

03:30:30.384 --> 03:30:31.618
MORE HOUSES TO SEEMINGLY BE

03:30:31.685 --> 03:30:34.321
BUILT AT THE EXPENSE OF PEOPLE

03:30:34.388 --> 03:30:35.456
ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO AFFORD

03:30:35.522 --> 03:30:36.357
THEM. AND I THINK THAT'S THE

03:30:36.423 --> 03:30:38.292
CONUNDRUM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE.

03:30:38.359 --> 03:30:40.027
AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS,

03:30:40.094 --> 03:30:41.662
WHAT? WHERE DOES THAT SUPPLY

03:30:41.729 --> 03:30:43.497
AND DEMAND CURVE INTERSECT TO

03:30:43.564 --> 03:30:45.165
WHERE IT ACTUALLY BECOMES MORE

03:30:45.232 --> 03:30:46.400
AFFORDABLE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

03:30:46.467 --> 03:30:48.902
SEEN IT? AND IS IT WE JUST NEED

03:30:48.969 --> 03:30:50.604
THREE MORE 3 MILLION MORE UNITS

03:30:50.671 --> 03:30:51.338
TOMORROW? BECAUSE IF SO, THAT'S

03:30:51.405 --> 03:30:53.507
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. RIGHT? SO

03:30:53.574 --> 03:30:55.175
YOU KNOW, IF WE DON'T GET TO

03:30:55.242 --> 03:30:56.443
THAT POINT THEN HOW DO YOU MAKE

03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:58.545
IT? YOU KNOW, A MARKET WHERE

03:30:58.612 --> 03:31:00.314
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY ENTER, IF I

03:31:00.381 --> 03:31:01.749
MAY. I MEAN, UNFORTUNATELY, I

03:31:01.815 --> 03:31:03.217
THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK OUTSIDE

03:31:03.283 --> 03:31:05.619
OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK WE

03:31:05.686 --> 03:31:06.453
HAVE GOOD EXAMPLES IN THE STATE

03:31:06.520 --> 03:31:07.321
OF WHERE WE HAVE REALLY

03:31:07.388 --> 03:31:09.189
UNLEASHED ENOUGH SUPPLY TO BE

03:31:09.256 --> 03:31:11.158
ABLE TO BEND THE CURVE ON COSTS,

03:31:11.225 --> 03:31:12.226
BUT WE DO SEE EXAMPLES OF THAT

03:31:12.292 --> 03:31:13.460
ELSEWHERE. ONE THAT HAS GOTTEN

03:31:13.527 --> 03:31:15.362
A LOT OF ATTENTION RECENTLY IS

03:31:15.429 --> 03:31:16.163
AUSTIN, TEXAS, WHICH WENT

03:31:16.230 --> 03:31:17.464
THROUGH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

03:31:17.531 --> 03:31:18.866
UPZONING AND LIBERALIZING IN

03:31:18.932 --> 03:31:20.034
THEIR DEVELOPMENT PROCESS,

03:31:20.100 --> 03:31:21.301
UNLEASHED A GIGANTIC BUILDING

03:31:21.368 --> 03:31:22.770
BOOM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

03:31:22.836 --> 03:31:24.571
YEARS OF INFILL APARTMENTS AND

03:31:24.638 --> 03:31:27.274
HAS SEEN RENTS FLATLINE.

03:31:27.341 --> 03:31:28.509
AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND IS

03:31:28.575 --> 03:31:30.244
ANOTHER ONE WHICH HAS HAD A LOT

03:31:30.310 --> 03:31:32.046
OF GOOD RESEARCH ON. WENT

03:31:32.112 --> 03:31:33.547
THROUGH A SUBSTANTIAL BOTH

03:31:33.614 --> 03:31:34.581
UPZONING PROCESS OF CREATING

03:31:34.648 --> 03:31:36.383
CERTAINTY SAW A BUILDING BOOM

03:31:36.450 --> 03:31:38.185
AND SAW PRICES TEMPER. SO I

03:31:38.252 --> 03:31:40.254
THINK THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE LIKE

03:31:40.320 --> 03:31:42.389
NIBBLING AT THIS PROBLEM AND WE

03:31:42.456 --> 03:31:43.424
NEED TO TAKE SOME BIG STEPS IN

03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:45.726
ORDER TO SEE THE KIND OF

03:31:45.793 --> 03:31:46.293
BENEFITS FOR SUPPLY THAT WE

03:31:46.360 --> 03:31:48.228
WANT TO SEE. BUT THAT'S NOT A

03:31:48.295 --> 03:31:50.431
REASON NOT TO TO TO DO IT. YEAH.

03:31:50.497 --> 03:31:52.433
I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S A CAUSE

03:31:52.499 --> 03:31:54.468
TO SORT OF MOTIVATE MORE THE

03:31:54.535 --> 03:31:56.770
KIND OF ATTENTION YOU GUYS ARE

03:31:56.837 --> 03:31:57.371
PUTTING ON THIS TOPIC. THANK

03:31:57.438 --> 03:31:59.506
YOU. I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP.

03:31:59.573 --> 03:32:01.475
YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT I THINK

03:32:01.542 --> 03:32:03.210
IS REALLY POIGNANT, AND IT CAME

03:32:03.277 --> 03:32:04.178
UP IN THE EARLIER COMMITTEE

03:32:04.244 --> 03:32:06.814
ABOUT THE ADU SPACE AND HOW

03:32:06.880 --> 03:32:08.515
MUCH LEGISLATION HAS HAPPENED.

03:32:08.582 --> 03:32:12.386
AND THE DID OVER 2500 UNITS

03:32:12.453 --> 03:32:13.554
THAT THEY COULDN'T MEET THE

03:32:13.620 --> 03:32:15.589
DEMAND. RIGHT, BECAUSE IT GOT

03:32:15.656 --> 03:32:17.491
SO STREAMLINED. AND, YOU KNOW,

03:32:17.558 --> 03:32:20.360
I THINK WE KEEP IMPROVING THOSE

03:32:20.427 --> 03:32:22.663
LAWS. AND NOW IF WE TOOK WHAT'S

03:32:22.729 --> 03:32:24.231
HAPPENING IN THAT SPACE TO

03:32:24.298 --> 03:32:26.333
CREATE MORE PREDICTABILITY,

03:32:26.400 --> 03:32:28.268
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH A PLANNING

03:32:28.335 --> 03:32:30.471
AND LAND USE, AND WHAT DOES

03:32:30.537 --> 03:32:32.306
THAT LOOK LIKE FOR FOR

03:32:32.372 --> 03:32:34.208
DEVELOPERS? BECAUSE WE ARE

03:32:34.274 --> 03:32:35.509
STILL DEALING WITH COMMUNITIES

03:32:35.576 --> 03:32:37.411
WHO ARE RESISTANT TO THEIR

03:32:37.478 --> 03:32:39.480
HOUSING ELEMENTS. WE'RE STILL

03:32:39.546 --> 03:32:41.148
DEALING WITH COMMUNITIES THAT,

03:32:41.215 --> 03:32:43.417
YOU KNOW, NOT NECESSARILY.

03:32:43.484 --> 03:32:45.486
AGAIN, IT'S JUST EVERYBODY IS

03:32:45.552 --> 03:32:47.321
PROTECTIVE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES

03:32:47.387 --> 03:32:49.823
AND, YOU KNOW, GOVERNING

03:32:49.890 --> 03:32:51.859
SOMETIMES IS WEAPONIZED AGAINST

03:32:51.925 --> 03:32:54.461
DEVELOPERS BASED ON HOW PEOPLE

03:32:54.528 --> 03:32:57.131
FEEL ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS OR

03:32:57.197 --> 03:32:58.365
THEIR COMMUNITY CHANGING. LIKE,

03:32:58.432 --> 03:33:00.534
FOR EXAMPLE, I COME FROM A VERY

03:33:00.601 --> 03:33:02.169
SMALL TOWN THAT FOUGHT

03:33:02.236 --> 03:33:03.504
REDEVELOPMENT, THAT ANYTHING

03:33:03.570 --> 03:33:05.539
BEYOND TWO STORIES, YOU KNOW,

03:33:05.606 --> 03:33:07.741
WAS NOT, YOU KNOW, ACCEPTABLE

03:33:07.808 --> 03:33:09.810
TO THEM. SO WE STILL HAVE THAT

03:33:09.877 --> 03:33:11.678
IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S REALLY

03:33:11.745 --> 03:33:13.447
FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT'S ALL

03:33:13.514 --> 03:33:15.149
THAT WINDOW OF TIME. AND I

03:33:15.215 --> 03:33:17.451
THINK IT BECAME VERY NOTICEABLE

03:33:17.518 --> 03:33:20.254
IN THE GREAT RECESSION THAT SO

03:33:20.320 --> 03:33:22.723
MANY DEVELOPMENTS GOT CAUGHT IN

03:33:22.789 --> 03:33:26.293
THAT BECAUSE NOT ONLY THE

03:33:26.360 --> 03:33:27.594
MARKET, BUT DEPENDING WHERE YOU

03:33:27.661 --> 03:33:29.296
WERE IN THAT CYCLE AS A

03:33:29.363 --> 03:33:30.397
DEVELOPER, IF YOU WERE IN LAND

03:33:30.464 --> 03:33:32.599
ACQUISITION OR YOU WERE IN

03:33:32.666 --> 03:33:36.336
ENTITLEMENT, IT MESSED UP THE

03:33:36.403 --> 03:33:37.204
CONSTRUCTION LOANS THAT MESSED

03:33:37.271 --> 03:33:39.773
UP THE TAKEOUT LOANS. EVERYONE

03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:42.476
JUST FROZE IN TIME, AND

03:33:42.543 --> 03:33:44.845
EVERYONE WHO MADE IT OUT BEFORE

03:33:44.912 --> 03:33:46.146
THE GREAT RECESSION OF LIKE, OH,

03:33:46.213 --> 03:33:48.882
I'M SO GLAD I CLOSED ON THAT

03:33:48.949 --> 03:33:51.084
DEAL OR SOLD THE UNITS SO AND

03:33:51.151 --> 03:33:52.419
AND PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND

03:33:52.486 --> 03:33:54.788
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF RISK THAT

03:33:54.855 --> 03:33:56.356
GOES INTO DEVELOPMENT. AND IT'S

03:33:56.423 --> 03:33:58.759
NOT FOR THE FAINT AT HEART. AND

03:33:58.825 --> 03:34:02.362
IT'S INTENSE. AND SO HOW DO WE

03:34:02.429 --> 03:34:04.264
SHORTEN THAT WINDOW OF

03:34:04.331 --> 03:34:06.233
DEVELOPMENT AND RISK, WHICH

03:34:06.300 --> 03:34:08.435
GOES BACK TO YOUR AFFORDABILITY

03:34:08.502 --> 03:34:11.271
POINT, THAT WHEN WE CAN CONTROL

03:34:11.338 --> 03:34:13.273
MORE I MEAN THINGS WILL ALWAYS

03:34:13.340 --> 03:34:15.309
CONSTRUCTION IS UNPREDICTABLE,

03:34:15.375 --> 03:34:17.110
RIGHT? A LOT OF THINGS GO GO

03:34:17.177 --> 03:34:18.645
WRONG. BUT THAT'S WHAT, YOU

03:34:18.712 --> 03:34:19.546
KNOW, CONSTRUCTION

03:34:19.613 --> 03:34:20.414
CONTINGENCIES ARE FOR TO TO

03:34:20.480 --> 03:34:22.249
MAKE SURE THAT YOU PLAN. BUT

03:34:22.316 --> 03:34:25.152
HOW CAN WE LEGISLATE TO CREATE

03:34:25.219 --> 03:34:27.421
A MORE PREDICTABLE ENTITLEMENT

03:34:27.487 --> 03:34:31.091
PROCESS? HOW CAN WE LEGISLATE

03:34:31.158 --> 03:34:33.193
TO REALLY HAVE THAT STATE

03:34:33.260 --> 03:34:34.228
MANDATE THAT THAT IS A PRIORITY

03:34:34.294 --> 03:34:36.763
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, WHEN WE ARE

03:34:36.830 --> 03:34:39.366
FIGHTING THE LOCAL LEVEL OF

03:34:39.433 --> 03:34:40.701
RESISTING DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR

03:34:40.767 --> 03:34:42.436
COMMUNITIES, AND I DON'T THINK

03:34:42.502 --> 03:34:44.571
WE'RE TOO FAR OFF. I DON'T KNOW

03:34:44.638 --> 03:34:46.240
WHEN I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU IF

03:34:46.306 --> 03:34:48.208
THERE WAS ANY STUDIES DONE BY

03:34:48.275 --> 03:34:49.743
THE TURNER CENTER ON FOREIGN

03:34:49.810 --> 03:34:51.612
INVESTMENT OF MULTIFAMILY, BUT

03:34:51.678 --> 03:34:52.613
EVEN SINGLE FAMILY, WHAT WHAT'S

03:34:52.679 --> 03:34:54.681
THAT DOING TO THE MARKET?

03:34:54.748 --> 03:34:56.516
BECAUSE I KNOW CANADA HAD THIS

03:34:56.583 --> 03:34:57.584
PROBLEM, IN PARTICULAR

03:34:57.651 --> 03:34:59.186
VANCOUVER, CANADA. AND THEY

03:34:59.253 --> 03:35:02.022
ACTUALLY DID DO LEGISLATION

03:35:02.089 --> 03:35:04.658
THAT DID A CAP ON HOW MUCH

03:35:04.725 --> 03:35:06.093
FOREIGN INVESTMENT COULD BUY UP

03:35:06.159 --> 03:35:08.662
SINGLE FAMILY. I HAVEN'T REALLY

03:35:08.729 --> 03:35:10.497
FOLLOWED UP ON, YOU KNOW, HOW

03:35:10.564 --> 03:35:11.832
THAT'S WORKING SEVERAL YEARS

03:35:11.898 --> 03:35:13.667
LATER, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF

03:35:13.734 --> 03:35:15.068
THAT'S A SPACE THAT CALIFORNIA.

03:35:15.135 --> 03:35:16.370
I MEAN, THAT'S I DON'T THINK

03:35:16.436 --> 03:35:18.739
I'M WITH YOU. I DON'T REALLY

03:35:18.805 --> 03:35:20.040
THINK IT'S THE OVERALL PROBLEM.

03:35:20.107 --> 03:35:22.342
I THINK IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO

03:35:22.409 --> 03:35:23.644
THINK AND ASSUME THAT THAT'S,

03:35:23.710 --> 03:35:25.279
YOU KNOW, THE BIG CONTRIBUTOR.

03:35:25.345 --> 03:35:27.281
I THINK IT'S MORE THE PIPELINE

03:35:27.347 --> 03:35:28.882
AND THE, YOU KNOW, NOT BEING IN

03:35:28.949 --> 03:35:29.783
A PREDICTABLE ENTITLEMENT

03:35:29.850 --> 03:35:31.318
PROCESS. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

03:35:31.385 --> 03:35:32.219
WE'RE STILL NOT YET DESPITE

03:35:32.286 --> 03:35:35.222
OVER 100 BILLS, DEVELOPERS ARE

03:35:35.289 --> 03:35:38.425
IN CERTAIN IN A MARKET. AND IF

03:35:38.492 --> 03:35:41.395
THEIR RISK WAS MITIGATED

03:35:41.461 --> 03:35:42.162
THROUGH CERTAINTY OF

03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:44.231
ENTITLEMENT, JUST LIKE WHAT WE

03:35:44.298 --> 03:35:46.466
DID WITH THE ADUS, WE MIGHT. AM

03:35:46.533 --> 03:35:47.434
I WRONG HEARING NO, YOU'RE

03:35:47.501 --> 03:35:50.003
RIGHT ON. IT'S IT'S MORE OF THE

03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.604
LENDERS THOUGH. DEVELOPERS WE

03:35:50.671 --> 03:35:52.172
FINALLY FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT

03:35:52.239 --> 03:35:55.342
WE'VE GOT POSITIVE MOVEMENT. WE

03:35:55.409 --> 03:35:56.243
HAVE THE TOOLS TO START TO DO

03:35:56.310 --> 03:35:58.312
THIS. BUT WHEN WE HAVE TO SIT

03:35:58.378 --> 03:36:00.414
WITH OUR BANKS AND WE HAVE TO

03:36:00.480 --> 03:36:02.082
EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT, HEY, WE

03:36:02.149 --> 03:36:03.317
STILL HAVE THIS OR THIS

03:36:03.383 --> 03:36:04.985
POTENTIAL CHALLENGE, THEIR

03:36:05.052 --> 03:36:07.321
FIRST REACTION IS, OKAY, WELL,

03:36:07.387 --> 03:36:08.989
MAKE SURE YOU ELIMINATE THOSE

03:36:09.056 --> 03:36:10.090
CHALLENGES. AND HOW DO YOU

03:36:10.157 --> 03:36:11.591
ELIMINATE THE CHALLENGES? YOU

03:36:11.658 --> 03:36:12.426
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNITS,

03:36:12.492 --> 03:36:14.461
RIGHT? YOU NEGOTIATE. AND

03:36:14.528 --> 03:36:15.896
THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THIS GOES

03:36:15.962 --> 03:36:18.465
TO. I WANT TO BACK UP ON ONE

03:36:18.532 --> 03:36:20.367
THING YOU SAID. I THINK ONE OF

03:36:20.434 --> 03:36:21.335
THE GREATEST THINGS THAT WE

03:36:21.401 --> 03:36:23.170
HAVE RIGHT NOW IS WE HAVE THE

03:36:23.236 --> 03:36:24.304
ABILITY TO CONTACT HCD. HCD HAS

03:36:24.371 --> 03:36:25.472
BEEN FANTASTIC ON NUMEROUS

03:36:25.539 --> 03:36:27.674
MUNICIPALITIES THAT WERE, AND

03:36:27.741 --> 03:36:29.109
THEY HAVE PROVIDED FANTASTIC

03:36:29.176 --> 03:36:30.577
GUIDANCE AND LEADERSHIP. THERE

03:36:30.644 --> 03:36:32.913
WAS ONE PROJECT THAT WAS

03:36:32.979 --> 03:36:34.181
COMPLETELY STALLED. THERE WAS

03:36:34.247 --> 03:36:36.750
LAWSUITS BY US AND A TOLLING

03:36:36.817 --> 03:36:37.484
AGREEMENT AS SOON AS HCD

03:36:37.551 --> 03:36:39.720
INTERJECTED MADE THE FINDINGS,

03:36:39.786 --> 03:36:40.654
THE CITY COMPLETELY REVERSED

03:36:40.721 --> 03:36:42.589
COURSE. AND NOW THAT THAT

03:36:42.656 --> 03:36:43.357
PROJECT IS RUNNING THROUGH,

03:36:43.423 --> 03:36:44.524
WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS

03:36:44.591 --> 03:36:47.127
WHEN WE SIT IN THESE CITY

03:36:47.194 --> 03:36:49.396
MEETINGS, WE WILL HAVE STAFF

03:36:49.463 --> 03:36:50.197
TELL US, DO NOT. WE DON'T

03:36:50.263 --> 03:36:52.265
APPRECIATE WHEN YOU CONTACT HCD.

03:36:52.332 --> 03:36:54.267
WE'RE NOT SURE OF THEIR

03:36:54.334 --> 03:36:56.136
AUTHORITY. AND SO IT WOULD BE,

03:36:56.203 --> 03:36:59.606
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC TO HAVE

03:36:59.673 --> 03:37:03.443
MORE. FACTS ABOUT WHAT HCD'S

03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:05.312
ROLE IS IN ALL OF THIS, AND

03:37:05.379 --> 03:37:07.247
THAT THEY REALLY ARE A

03:37:07.314 --> 03:37:08.081
POWERHOUSE IN HELPING US GET

03:37:08.148 --> 03:37:11.885
THESE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD.

03:37:11.952 --> 03:37:14.154
GOTCHA. AND I THINK THERE'S A

03:37:14.221 --> 03:37:16.289
SECTION IN THIS, IN THIS SELECT

03:37:16.356 --> 03:37:18.125
COMMITTEE TOO, THAT WE WORK

03:37:18.191 --> 03:37:20.227
WITH BANKING SOLUTIONS. I THINK,

03:37:20.293 --> 03:37:22.996
LIKE YOU SAID, THE LENDERS AND

03:37:23.063 --> 03:37:24.297
THE UNDERWRITING, THERE HAS TO

03:37:24.364 --> 03:37:26.433
BE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT FROM

03:37:26.500 --> 03:37:29.269
OUR PRIVATE LENDERS. AND

03:37:29.336 --> 03:37:31.505
BECAUSE OF THE RISK IN SOME OF

03:37:31.571 --> 03:37:33.173
THESE SPACES, THEY'RE BEHAVING

03:37:33.240 --> 03:37:34.608
DIFFERENTLY. AGAIN, IT'S THAT,

03:37:34.674 --> 03:37:36.476
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE WANTS TO

03:37:36.543 --> 03:37:37.277
CONTROL AND BE ABLE TO HAVE

03:37:37.344 --> 03:37:39.713
PREDICTABLE OUTCOMES, BUT THERE

03:37:39.780 --> 03:37:42.349
IS A SPACE THAT, YOU KNOW, IF

03:37:42.416 --> 03:37:44.217
WE ALL TAKE A LITTLE RISK

03:37:44.284 --> 03:37:46.286
TOGETHER, IT MINIMIZES THE RISK.

03:37:46.353 --> 03:37:48.388
BUT WHEN PEOPLE STAND ON THE

03:37:48.455 --> 03:37:49.122
SIDELINES WAITING FOR ONE

03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:51.391
INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE ON 80% OF

03:37:51.458 --> 03:37:53.126
THE RISK, THAT'S WHEN THE DELAY

03:37:53.193 --> 03:37:55.929
IN CONSTRUCTION STARTS TO

03:37:55.996 --> 03:37:58.198
HAPPEN. SO FINDING THAT BALANCE

03:37:58.265 --> 03:38:00.434
WHERE WE CAN BALANCE OUT THE

03:38:00.500 --> 03:38:03.170
RISK OF ENTITLEMENT AND THE

03:38:03.236 --> 03:38:05.405
LENDING SIDE, ESPECIALLY WITH

03:38:05.472 --> 03:38:06.706
THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT

03:38:06.773 --> 03:38:08.208
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

03:38:08.275 --> 03:38:09.443
CALIFORNIA, I THINK IS ALSO KEY

03:38:09.509 --> 03:38:11.311
THAT IN A SPACE WE SHOULD

03:38:11.378 --> 03:38:13.213
OCCUPY. AND I HOPE THAT'S A

03:38:13.280 --> 03:38:14.981
SPACE THAT'S OF INTEREST TO YOU

03:38:15.048 --> 03:38:16.116
ALL TO KIND OF FURTHER

03:38:16.183 --> 03:38:18.351
DISSECTING THAT, TO COME UP

03:38:18.418 --> 03:38:20.320
WITH TANGIBLE RECOMMENDATIONS

03:38:20.387 --> 03:38:22.756
IN THAT SPACE AND AND TRYING TO

03:38:22.823 --> 03:38:25.459
CREATE A MORE PREDICTABLE

03:38:25.525 --> 03:38:27.394
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS AND LENDING

03:38:27.461 --> 03:38:31.231
PROCESS IN AN UNPREDICTABLE

03:38:31.298 --> 03:38:34.201
ENVIRONMENT. RIGHT. SO I THINK

03:38:34.267 --> 03:38:36.403
THERE'S SPACE FOR US TO, TO

03:38:36.470 --> 03:38:39.206
IMPROVE ON THE EXISTING MODEL.

03:38:39.272 --> 03:38:41.341
CAN I JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION?

03:38:41.408 --> 03:38:42.175
WE DON'T WE WE DO HAVE A

03:38:42.242 --> 03:38:43.376
PROJECT UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW,

03:38:43.443 --> 03:38:45.312
WHICH WE'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE

03:38:45.378 --> 03:38:46.847
WITH YOU WHEN WE COMPLETE

03:38:46.913 --> 03:38:47.647
LOOKING AT THE IMPACTS OF

03:38:47.714 --> 03:38:49.115
CORPORATE CORPORATE OWNERSHIP,

03:38:49.182 --> 03:38:50.484
SORT OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING SO

03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:52.252
FAR IS IT ACTUALLY IS HELPFUL

03:38:52.319 --> 03:38:53.386
FROM AN AFFORDABILITY

03:38:53.453 --> 03:38:54.521
STANDPOINT BECAUSE IT'S TAKING

03:38:54.588 --> 03:38:55.622
THAT PRODUCT, THAT SINGLE

03:38:55.689 --> 03:38:57.057
FAMILY HOME AND MAKING IT

03:38:57.123 --> 03:38:58.258
AVAILABLE MORE CHEAPLY BECAUSE

03:38:58.325 --> 03:39:00.427
THE, THE, THE COST THAT IT

03:39:00.494 --> 03:39:02.162
COSTS TO RENT THAT HOME IS LESS

03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:03.430
THAN THE COST THAT IT WOULD BE

03:39:03.497 --> 03:39:05.565
TO PAY A MORTGAGE AND ACCESS TO

03:39:05.632 --> 03:39:06.466
A DOWN PAYMENT, BUT THAT

03:39:06.533 --> 03:39:08.301
AFFORDABILITY IS COMING AT A

03:39:08.368 --> 03:39:09.736
TRADE OFF OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY.

03:39:09.803 --> 03:39:10.270
YOU'RE LOSING THE WEALTH

03:39:10.337 --> 03:39:11.571
BUILDING POTENTIAL, BUT YOU'RE

03:39:11.638 --> 03:39:13.273
GAINING ON THE AFFORDABILITY.

03:39:13.340 --> 03:39:15.175
I'D ALSO JUST SAY, LIKE, I DO

03:39:15.242 --> 03:39:17.244
THINK THERE ARE SOME CITIES IN

03:39:17.310 --> 03:39:18.311
CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ACTUALLY

03:39:18.378 --> 03:39:19.613
HAVE DONE GREAT WORK, LIKE THE

03:39:19.679 --> 03:39:21.581
CITIES HAVE PROVIDED QUITE GOOD,

03:39:21.648 --> 03:39:22.482
GOOD PATHWAYS. I ACTUALLY THINK

03:39:22.549 --> 03:39:23.483
SACRAMENTO IS AMONG QUITE,

03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:25.118
QUITE GOOD, AND SAN DIEGO HAS

03:39:25.185 --> 03:39:26.486
DONE A QUITE GOOD JOB. I THINK

03:39:26.553 --> 03:39:28.121
IT'S VERY HARD FOR THE

03:39:28.188 --> 03:39:29.456
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SORT

03:39:29.523 --> 03:39:30.423
OF SEE THAT LOCAL VARIABILITY

03:39:30.490 --> 03:39:31.324
AND UNDERWRITE AGAINST IT.

03:39:31.391 --> 03:39:32.259
THEY'RE LOOKING AT BIG, BROAD

03:39:32.325 --> 03:39:34.094
STROKES ACROSS THE WHOLE MARKET

03:39:34.160 --> 03:39:35.529
OR THE WHOLE STATE, AND THEY'RE

03:39:35.595 --> 03:39:37.130
ALWAYS GOING TO LAG A LITTLE

03:39:37.197 --> 03:39:38.265
BIT BEHIND. AND SO I THINK

03:39:38.331 --> 03:39:40.333
THAT'S WHY THE THE ROLE OF THE

03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:41.301
STATE IS SO IMPORTANT IS BY

03:39:41.368 --> 03:39:43.370
TRYING TO SORT OF IN THE POWER

03:39:43.436 --> 03:39:45.505
THAT HE HAS TO TRY AND LIKE, AT

03:39:45.572 --> 03:39:47.140
LEAST IF THERE'S GOING TO BE

03:39:47.207 --> 03:39:48.208
VARIABILITY, KEEP IT WITHIN

03:39:48.275 --> 03:39:49.476
SOME CERTAIN BOUNDS SO THAT THE

03:39:49.543 --> 03:39:50.677
BANKS CAN UNDERSTAND KIND OF

03:39:50.744 --> 03:39:52.512
WHAT THEY HAVE TO UNDERWRITE.

03:39:52.579 --> 03:39:53.346
WELL, I DEFINITELY THINK I MEAN,

03:39:53.413 --> 03:39:55.081
I'M HEARING YOU LOUD AND CLEAR

03:39:55.148 --> 03:39:57.150
THAT WE WE DO NEED TO DEAL WITH

03:39:57.217 --> 03:39:58.251
THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

03:39:58.318 --> 03:39:59.452
INCENTIVIZE AND HAVE THEM LOOK

03:39:59.519 --> 03:40:01.187
AT THEIR UNDERWRITING IN A

03:40:01.254 --> 03:40:02.289
DIFFERENT LENS, GIVEN THE

03:40:02.355 --> 03:40:04.124
CRISIS. RIGHT. AND WHAT IS THE

03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:06.293
CARROT FOR THEM TO CREATE A

03:40:06.359 --> 03:40:08.028
MORE CERTAIN MARKET? AND WHO

03:40:08.094 --> 03:40:09.429
ARE THE PLAYERS? WELL, NOT THE

03:40:09.496 --> 03:40:11.464
I MEAN, WE CAN'T CONTROL, BUT

03:40:11.531 --> 03:40:13.166
TO REASSURE THEM PLAYING IN A

03:40:13.233 --> 03:40:15.302
CERTAIN MARKET THAT THERE IS,

03:40:15.368 --> 03:40:18.204
YOU KNOW, SOME GUARANTEE, YOU

03:40:18.271 --> 03:40:20.407
KNOW, THAT MINIMIZES THE RISK.

03:40:20.473 --> 03:40:22.142
SO I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY A

03:40:22.208 --> 03:40:23.476
SPACE THAT THE SELECT COMMITTEE

03:40:23.543 --> 03:40:25.645
CAN PLAY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

03:40:25.712 --> 03:40:27.647
FURTHER ENGAGING BOTH OF YOU IN

03:40:27.714 --> 03:40:28.481
THAT SPACE AND OTHER DEVELOPERS

03:40:28.548 --> 03:40:31.117
AS WELL, BECAUSE I THINK TO MY

03:40:31.184 --> 03:40:34.154
COLLEAGUE'S POINT, YOU KNOW,

03:40:34.220 --> 03:40:38.325
IT'S ON THE FINANCE SIDE. NO, I

03:40:38.391 --> 03:40:39.159
APPRECIATE YEAH, I AGREE, AND

03:40:39.225 --> 03:40:40.327
I'LL ECHO THAT, I APPRECIATE

03:40:40.393 --> 03:40:41.595
THE CONVERSATION AND JUST

03:40:41.661 --> 03:40:43.630
EVERYTHING YOU GUYS ARE DOING.

03:40:43.697 --> 03:40:44.431
AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TRYING TO

03:40:44.497 --> 03:40:48.034
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT, WHAT

03:40:48.101 --> 03:40:50.170
WE CAN DO THAT HASN'T ALREADY

03:40:50.236 --> 03:40:51.538
BEEN DONE. I MEAN, I THINK ALL

03:40:51.605 --> 03:40:53.173
THE EASY STUFF HAS BEEN DONE.

03:40:53.239 --> 03:40:54.441
AND I DO THINK THAT THE

03:40:54.507 --> 03:40:56.376
LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST FEW

03:40:56.443 --> 03:40:57.978
YEARS HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF

03:40:58.044 --> 03:40:59.112
PUSHING THROUGH SOME OF THE

03:40:59.179 --> 03:41:00.380
CERTAINTY MEASURES THAT WE NEED.

03:41:00.447 --> 03:41:01.982
AND I DO THINK THAT THERE'S

03:41:02.048 --> 03:41:04.284
SOME REAL THERE'S SOME REAL, I

03:41:04.351 --> 03:41:06.453
THINK, BUY IN ACROSS THE BOARD

03:41:06.519 --> 03:41:08.355
AND TRYING TO SOLVE THIS. AND

03:41:08.421 --> 03:41:09.422
NOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO THINK

03:41:09.489 --> 03:41:11.057
OF, WELL, HOW CAN WE THINK

03:41:11.124 --> 03:41:12.525
CREATIVELY ABOUT DOING OTHER

03:41:12.592 --> 03:41:13.326
THINGS. HENCE SOME OF THESE

03:41:13.393 --> 03:41:14.527
QUESTIONS. SOME OF THEM DON'T

03:41:14.594 --> 03:41:16.229
MAKE SENSE AND SOME OF THEM DO.

03:41:16.296 --> 03:41:17.530
RIGHT. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, I MEAN,

03:41:17.597 --> 03:41:18.632
THIS COMMITTEE WILL PROBABLY

03:41:18.698 --> 03:41:20.367
TALK ABOUT, DARE I SAY, PROP 13

03:41:20.433 --> 03:41:22.602
REFORM. I MEAN, YOU WANT TO

03:41:22.669 --> 03:41:23.536
TALK ABOUT SUPPLY. I MEAN, YOU

03:41:23.603 --> 03:41:25.639
WANT TO TALK ABOUT GENERATIONAL

03:41:25.705 --> 03:41:27.574
ISSUES, LIKE, WHY WOULDN'T WE

03:41:27.641 --> 03:41:28.541
TALK ABOUT THAT? AND I KNOW

03:41:28.608 --> 03:41:30.343
FROM A DEVELOPER STANDPOINT

03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:33.013
THAT ISN'T EXACTLY, YOU KNOW,

03:41:33.079 --> 03:41:36.216
ON YOUR DOCKET, BUT AS

03:41:36.282 --> 03:41:37.117
COMMUNITIES, WE SHOULD START

03:41:37.183 --> 03:41:39.185
TALKING MORE ABOUT EXISTING

03:41:39.252 --> 03:41:40.453
SUPPLY AND WHY THAT DOESN'T

03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:43.323
ACTUALLY TURN OVER OR ADAPTIVE

03:41:43.390 --> 03:41:45.358
REUSE. THERE'S A TON OF EMPTY

03:41:45.425 --> 03:41:47.160
BUILDINGS. AND YOU TALKED ABOUT

03:41:47.227 --> 03:41:48.194
THIS LAST PANEL KIND OF SURPLUS

03:41:48.261 --> 03:41:50.030
LANDS, BUT ALSO SURPLUS

03:41:50.096 --> 03:41:51.531
BUILDINGS, INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS

03:41:51.598 --> 03:41:52.399
OF SURPLUS INDUSTRIAL AND

03:41:52.465 --> 03:41:54.601
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS THAT ARE

03:41:54.668 --> 03:41:56.069
EITHER TOTALLY UNDERUTILIZED OR

03:41:56.136 --> 03:41:58.271
UNUTILIZED. AND WE DON'T SEE A

03:41:58.338 --> 03:41:59.506
LOT OF ACTIVITY IN ADAPTIVE

03:41:59.572 --> 03:42:01.474
REUSE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

03:42:01.541 --> 03:42:04.711
COSTLY. IT'S NOT AS EASY AS

03:42:04.778 --> 03:42:06.146
PEOPLE THINK TO TURN A

03:42:06.212 --> 03:42:07.647
COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL

03:42:07.714 --> 03:42:08.348
BUILDING INTO HOUSING. BUT WHY

03:42:08.415 --> 03:42:10.150
AREN'T WE DOING MORE OF THAT?

03:42:10.216 --> 03:42:11.284
RIGHT, RATHER THAN BUILDING

03:42:11.351 --> 03:42:13.319
FROM THE GROUND UP? AND YOUR

03:42:13.386 --> 03:42:15.121
PRESENTATION WAS EVEN A LOT OF

03:42:15.188 --> 03:42:16.356
THE ECONOMIC CALCULUS IS JUST

03:42:16.423 --> 03:42:18.024
BUYING SOMETHING THAT EXISTS

03:42:18.091 --> 03:42:19.292
VERSUS BUILDING IT. WELL, WE

03:42:19.359 --> 03:42:21.561
HAVE A LOT OF BUILDINGS.

03:42:21.628 --> 03:42:23.563
THERE'S A TON. WHY WHY CAN'T WE?

03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:25.765
IF WE NEED HOUSING THIS BADLY,

03:42:25.832 --> 03:42:27.033
WHY AREN'T WE DOING EVERYTHING

03:42:27.100 --> 03:42:28.635
WE CAN INTO INCENTIVIZING

03:42:28.702 --> 03:42:31.404
ADAPTIVE REUSE? I DON'T KNOW IF

03:42:31.471 --> 03:42:32.205
YOU'VE LOOKED AT THAT, BUT I

03:42:32.272 --> 03:42:34.340
MEAN, THESE ARE THINGS THAT I

03:42:34.407 --> 03:42:35.208
THINK THIS SELECT COMMITTEE,

03:42:35.275 --> 03:42:36.242
BECAUSE IT IS A SELECT

03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:38.178
COMMITTEE. WE HAVE JUST A LOT

03:42:38.244 --> 03:42:40.180
OF FLEXIBILITY IN THINKING

03:42:40.246 --> 03:42:41.147
ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS. SO AND

03:42:41.214 --> 03:42:43.416
I THINK TOO, IT MIGHT BE A, YOU

03:42:43.483 --> 03:42:45.251
KNOW, HERE WE ARE, YOU KNOW,

03:42:45.318 --> 03:42:47.287
THREE HOURS LATER. AND YOU KNOW,

03:42:47.353 --> 03:42:48.421
I KIND OF FOREWARNED ALL MY

03:42:48.488 --> 03:42:49.622
COLLEAGUES, THIS ISN'T, YOU

03:42:49.689 --> 03:42:51.157
KNOW, LIKE THE TRADITIONAL

03:42:51.224 --> 03:42:52.158
COMMITTEES WHERE WE'RE KIND OF

03:42:52.225 --> 03:42:54.561
SKIM ON THE, YOU KNOW, SKATE

03:42:54.627 --> 03:42:55.428
AROUND THE REAL ISSUES. WE'RE

03:42:55.495 --> 03:42:57.263
GOING TO BE TAKING DEEP DIVE.

03:42:57.330 --> 03:42:59.265
AND THIS IS THE SPACE TO LEARN

03:42:59.332 --> 03:43:02.902
WHETHER IT'S YOUR SPACE OF

03:43:02.969 --> 03:43:04.037
EXPERTISE OR NOT. WE'RE WE'RE

03:43:04.104 --> 03:43:07.273
BOTH COMMITTED AS THE CHAIRS OF

03:43:07.340 --> 03:43:09.175
THIS COMMITTEE TO PRODUCE A

03:43:09.242 --> 03:43:10.176
DOCUMENT, A SOLID

03:43:10.243 --> 03:43:13.046
RECOMMENDATION TO THE SPEAKER

03:43:13.113 --> 03:43:14.681
WHO CREATED THE SELECT

03:43:14.748 --> 03:43:16.816
COMMITTEE OF AN ACTION PLAN.

03:43:16.883 --> 03:43:18.318
AND AND HOPEFULLY SOMETHING

03:43:18.384 --> 03:43:20.186
THAT, YOU KNOW, OUR GOVERNOR

03:43:20.253 --> 03:43:22.122
WOULD ALSO EITHER THE CURRENT

03:43:22.188 --> 03:43:25.358
OR THE FUTURE ONE. AND SO WE

03:43:25.425 --> 03:43:27.227
ARE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF

03:43:27.293 --> 03:43:29.395
HOURS TOGETHER DEEP DIVING INTO

03:43:29.462 --> 03:43:32.165
SPACES AND TRY TO THOUGHTFULLY

03:43:32.232 --> 03:43:34.434
COME UP WITH SOME FORM OF

03:43:34.501 --> 03:43:37.303
STRATEGIC PLAN, IF NOT A

03:43:37.370 --> 03:43:38.605
ROADMAP OF SHORT TERM, BECAUSE,

03:43:38.671 --> 03:43:40.707
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THIS STUFF IS

03:43:40.774 --> 03:43:43.009
TO UNDO IS GOING TO TAKE A FEW

03:43:43.076 --> 03:43:45.211
YEARS SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM

03:43:45.278 --> 03:43:47.547
PLANS WITH THIS. AND, YOU KNOW,

03:43:47.614 --> 03:43:49.582
I'M JUST GOING TO ASK FOR A LOT

03:43:49.649 --> 03:43:51.251
OF GRACE AND PATIENCE, NOT ONLY

03:43:51.317 --> 03:43:53.086
FOR MY COLLEAGUES AS WE DO THIS

03:43:53.153 --> 03:43:55.622
DEEP DIVE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE

03:43:55.688 --> 03:43:57.791
WE'RE COMMITTED TO, YOU KNOW,

03:43:57.857 --> 03:43:59.259
DROPPING DELIVERABLES AND NOT

03:43:59.325 --> 03:44:01.094
HAVING YOU ALL COME HERE AND

03:44:01.161 --> 03:44:03.363
SIT HOURS WITH US AND NOT HAVE

03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:05.365
AN OUTCOME TO THIS. SO THAT'S

03:44:05.431 --> 03:44:07.100
THAT'S OUR LEADERSHIP THAT WE

03:44:07.167 --> 03:44:09.002
WANT TO BRING TO THIS. AND, YOU

03:44:09.068 --> 03:44:11.070
KNOW, IN SOME SPACES AND I

03:44:11.137 --> 03:44:12.438
ALWAYS SAY THIS, YOU DON'T KNOW

03:44:12.505 --> 03:44:13.540
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. EVEN

03:44:13.606 --> 03:44:15.175
THOUGH I SPENT 30 YEARS IN

03:44:15.241 --> 03:44:16.242
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, FROM THE

03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:17.477
LAND USE ACQUISITION TO THE

03:44:17.544 --> 03:44:19.646
FINANCE SIDE, TO THE PROGRAM

03:44:19.712 --> 03:44:21.347
SIDE, RIGHT. AND EVERY DAY,

03:44:21.414 --> 03:44:22.515
EVEN AFTER 30 YEARS FROM

03:44:22.582 --> 03:44:25.285
WORKING IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY,

03:44:25.351 --> 03:44:26.586
ALAMEDA COUNTY AND THE WHOLE

03:44:26.653 --> 03:44:28.121
BAY AREA AND THEN THE STATE AT

03:44:28.188 --> 03:44:29.455
CALHFA, THAT I STILL DON'T FEEL

03:44:29.522 --> 03:44:31.291
LIKE A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT

03:44:31.357 --> 03:44:32.892
BECAUSE IT'S A HOUSING, AS YOU

03:44:32.959 --> 03:44:34.494
KNOW, AS A DEVELOPER, YOU ARE

03:44:34.561 --> 03:44:36.396
IT IS A MOVING TARGET, RIGHT?

03:44:36.462 --> 03:44:37.230
BECAUSE IT ALL DEPENDS ON

03:44:37.297 --> 03:44:39.265
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE UNIVERSE.

03:44:39.332 --> 03:44:41.534
AND SO WATCHING IT OVER THE

03:44:41.601 --> 03:44:44.604
PAST 30 YEARS EVOLVE. YOU KNOW,

03:44:44.671 --> 03:44:46.039
IT'S A CONSTANT MOVING TARGET.

03:44:46.105 --> 03:44:48.308
BUT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT

03:44:48.374 --> 03:44:49.442
THE TALENT POOL THAT'S HERE.

03:44:49.509 --> 03:44:51.311
AND TO, AS I SAID EARLIER, TO

03:44:51.377 --> 03:44:53.279
RECONNECT WITH SO MANY FAMILIAR

03:44:53.346 --> 03:44:55.515
FACES FROM THE HOUSING FAMILY,

03:44:55.582 --> 03:44:58.618
THE NETWORK THAT WE CALL IT,

03:44:58.685 --> 03:45:00.253
THAT EVERYONE'S GOING SOLID,

03:45:00.320 --> 03:45:03.289
STRONG TO CONTINUING TO WANT TO

03:45:03.356 --> 03:45:04.624
SOLVE THIS. AND I THINK WE HAVE

03:45:04.691 --> 03:45:06.392
A VERY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY IN

03:45:06.459 --> 03:45:08.494
THE LEGISLATURE, BECAUSE I

03:45:08.561 --> 03:45:10.230
DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN AN

03:45:10.296 --> 03:45:12.465
ACTUAL SELECT COMMITTEE CREATED

03:45:12.532 --> 03:45:15.134
ON ACTUAL THE FINANCING SIDE.

03:45:15.201 --> 03:45:17.770
AND SO IT IS AN HONOR, AND IT

03:45:17.837 --> 03:45:19.272
IS A PRIVILEGE TO BE BESTOWED

03:45:19.339 --> 03:45:21.341
WITH THAT HONOR TO TO LEAD THIS

ELSE, I THINK IT ALL COMES BACK

03:46:29.342 --> 03:46:31.377
TO TIME. TIME TO PUT THE SHOVEL

03:46:31.444 --> 03:46:33.479
IN THE GROUND. TWO, THREE YEARS

03:46:33.546 --> 03:46:36.616
FOR ENTITLEMENTS. THAT'S THAT'S

03:46:36.683 --> 03:46:37.850

03:46:37.917 --> 03:46:39.152
THAT. YOU WANT AFFORDABILITY.

03:46:39.218 --> 03:46:40.687

LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF IN THE

03:46:46.326 --> 03:46:47.493
PLANNING SIDE WITH THE CITY.

03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:48.227
YEAH THAT'S WHAT USUALLY

03:46:48.294 --> 03:46:49.429
HAPPENS. BUT I MEAN THAT YEAR

03:46:49.495 --> 03:46:51.497
AND A HALF CAN TURN INTO TWO

03:46:51.564 --> 03:46:53.433

REMARKS? THE ONLY OTHER THING I

03:46:59.372 --> 03:47:01.274
WOULD TACK ON TO YOUR LIST IS,

03:47:01.341 --> 03:47:04.477
YOU KNOW, IN THE SPACE OF SORT

03:47:04.544 --> 03:47:06.346
OF BLUE SKY, THINKING THERE ARE

03:47:06.412 --> 03:47:07.213
OPPORTUNITIES TO THINK MORE

03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:08.448
EXPANSIVELY ABOUT THE STATE'S

03:47:08.514 --> 03:47:09.282
BALANCE SHEET AND ITS ABILITY

03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:11.284
TO INVEST IN FUND DIRECTLY INTO

03:47:11.351 --> 03:47:12.518
HOUSING. WE'VE TRADITIONALLY

03:47:12.585 --> 03:47:14.320
THOUGHT ABOUT A VERY BIFURCATED

03:47:14.387 --> 03:47:15.388
LANDSCAPE OF MARKET RATE

03:47:15.455 --> 03:47:16.055
DEVELOPERS WHO ARE FULLY

03:47:16.122 --> 03:47:17.323
UNSUBSIDIZED. ON THE ONE HAND,

03:47:17.390 --> 03:47:18.391
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

03:47:18.458 --> 03:47:20.026
WHO ARE VERY DEEPLY SUBSIDIZED

03:47:20.093 --> 03:47:21.527
ON THE OTHER. BUT THERE ARE

03:47:21.594 --> 03:47:22.328
GOOD EXAMPLES, BOTH IN

03:47:22.395 --> 03:47:23.229
CALIFORNIA'S DEEP HISTORY AS

03:47:23.296 --> 03:47:25.565
WELL AS IN OTHER PLACES AROUND

03:47:25.631 --> 03:47:26.332
THE COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S BEEN

03:47:26.399 --> 03:47:28.901
SORT OF A WAY TO PROVIDE EITHER

03:47:28.968 --> 03:47:30.303
JUST LOW COST FINANCING FROM

03:47:30.370 --> 03:47:32.538
THE STATE OFF THE STATE'S

03:47:32.605 --> 03:47:33.306
BALANCE SHEET DIRECTLY TO

03:47:33.373 --> 03:47:34.807
MARKET RATE HOUSING DEVELOPERS.

03:47:34.874 --> 03:47:36.442
SO KIND OF TAPPING INTO WHAT

03:47:36.509 --> 03:47:38.144
THEA BOWMAN SAID EARLIER, WE

03:47:38.211 --> 03:47:41.381
GOT TO REENGINEER THIS SO WE

03:47:41.447 --> 03:47:43.016
CAN WE CAN BLOW THAT BINARY UP

03:47:43.082 --> 03:47:44.484
IF WE WANT TO. RIGHT. LIKE WE

03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:46.185
CAN THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE MAKE

03:47:46.252 --> 03:47:47.320
MARKET RATE, MARKET RATE

03:47:47.387 --> 03:47:48.421
DEVELOPERS GET CHEAPER CAPITAL

03:47:48.488 --> 03:47:50.089
TO MOVE THEM OVER THE FINISH

03:47:50.156 --> 03:47:51.257
LINE, AND MAYBE ALONG THE WAY

03:47:51.324 --> 03:47:53.326
TO INDUCE THEM TO DO MAYBE, YOU

03:47:53.393 --> 03:47:54.494
KNOW, PRODUCT THAT'S A LITTLE

03:47:54.560 --> 03:47:55.361
BIT MORE ENTRY LEVEL OR

03:47:55.428 --> 03:47:57.163
AFFORDABLE. I THINK THAT'S WELL

03:47:57.230 --> 03:47:58.464
WITHIN THE POWER OF THE STATE

03:47:58.531 --> 03:47:59.966
TO IMAGINE IN THIS, IN THIS

03:48:00.033 --> 03:48:01.267
COMMITTEE. I WOULD SUGGEST ALSO

03:48:01.334 --> 03:48:02.335
TO CONSIDER YEAH, I THINK

03:48:02.402 --> 03:48:03.803
THAT'S DEFINITELY WHERE WE'RE

03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:05.571
GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A BIG

03:48:05.638 --> 03:48:06.806
DEEP DIVE OF RESTRUCTURING AND

03:48:06.873 --> 03:48:07.573
RE IMAGINING HOW THE FINANCING

03:48:07.640 --> 03:48:09.509
WORK AND REVERSE THIS TO SOME

03:48:09.575 --> 03:48:12.712
LEVEL. SO. WELL, THANK YOU BOTH.

03:48:12.779 --> 03:48:13.713
NOW YOU GUYS CAN HANG TIGHT.

TEAMS. WE AS I SAID EARLIER,

03:48:54.487 --> 03:48:55.555
WE'RE TRAINING THE NEXT

03:48:55.621 --> 03:48:57.423
