HAVING LOST HIS HOME AND

TO FALL INTO POVERTY AND

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:55.628
EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT TO RISE

DIFFERENT, AND FUNDING FOR THE

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:22.121

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:23.222

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.557
ELIMINATING FUNDING FOR CSBG IN

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:27.093
ITS 2026 FEDERAL BUDGET. THIS

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.832
ULTIMATELY CHOSE TO CONTINUE AND

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:34.166
MAINTAIN STABLE FUNDING FOR

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:36.936

BUT AMIDST THIS UNCERTAINTY, I

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:00.960
TAKE SOLACE IN THE FACT THAT

FOCUSED ON BEING LOCALLY LED,

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:34.993

HAVE TWO THINGS FUNDING AND

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:20.272
ACCESS. FIRST, ON FUNDING, WE

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.740
ARE ALL MORE THAN AWARE. FUNDING

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:22.975
LEVELS REMAIN A CRITICAL POINT

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.376
IN OUR POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS.

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:25.544
THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY ACTION

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.045
NETWORK WORKS COLLECTIVELY

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.580
SERVES AS A HUGE CATALYST FOR

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:30.516
AGENCIES TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:31.717
AND PERFORMANCE SYSTEMS, KEEPING

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.018
COSTS LOW TO MATCH LOW FUNDING.

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:34.920
THIS ALSO ALLOWS DEVELOPMENT AND

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:36.355
CAPACITY BUILDING TO HAPPEN MORE

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:37.489
RAPIDLY, AND ALLOWS CAL TO MOVE

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.391
ALL THE DATA WE COLLECT INTO

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:40.526
INFORMATION. WE ARE THEN ABLE TO

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.428
TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND PUT IT

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:44.229
INTO COMMUNICATION IN A WAY THAT

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:45.531
PEOPLE ARE BETTER TO LEARN ABOUT

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:46.765
THE CSBG OPPORTUNITIES THAT

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:47.466
BENEFIT COMMUNITIES. THIS IS

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:48.867
POWERFUL FOR US AS A NETWORK AND

00:17:48.934 --> 00:17:51.036
FOR YOU AS DECISION MAKERS ON

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.538
ACCESS. THE KEY TO CSBG IS

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.072
CONNECTING CONNECTIVITY ACROSS

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:55.541
OUR STATE ALLOWS YOU, AS

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:56.608
POLICYMAKERS, TO KNOW THAT YOU

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.710
HAVE LOCAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND

00:17:58.777 --> 00:17:59.344
ORGANIZATIONS READY TO DELIVER

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.145
OPPORTUNITIES TO FAMILIES,

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:01.180
WHETHER IT BE AN EMERGENCY,

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.848
DISASTER RESPONSE, STABILITY

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.817
EFFORTS, OR ECONOMIC MOBILITY

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:05.517
OPPORTUNITIES. HAVING THIS

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:06.952
ACCESS READILY AVAILABLE IS

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.387
BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE OF

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:09.621
CALIFORNIA. YOU WILL HEAR MORE

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:11.590

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:12.224
SUCCESSES AND HOW OUR AGENCIES

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:13.759
ABILITIES ARE MAXIMIZED AS WE

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:15.594
CONTINUE TO NAVIGATE THE LONG

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.162
AND LONG TERM IMPACTS OF LIMITED

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:18.397
FUNDING, ALL OF WHICH ADVERSELY

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:20.632
AFFECT PEOPLE OF LOW INCOME.

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:21.700
COMMUNITY ACTION WILL CONTINUE

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.303

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:31.677
STATE'S RESPONSE TO NEEDS, AS

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:34.012
WELL AS TO LEAD THE COUNTRY IN

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:34.613
THE WORK FOR OUR FAMILIES AND

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.614
COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:39.218
ON OUR NETWORK AND ON THE CSBG

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.086

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:43.121
GREAT STATE. THANK YOU VERY

00:18:43.188 --> 00:18:47.192
MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON. IT IS

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:48.794
CERTAINLY A PRIVILEGE FOR MYSELF

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.963
TO BE HERE. MY NAME IS MARY

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:52.264
ALICE ESCARCEGA AND I'M THE

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:53.599

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:56.535
TRAINING, AND ALSO THE PROUD

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:59.538
PRESIDENT OF CAL KAPPA. CSBG IS

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:02.307
MORE THAN A GRANT. IT IS THE

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:03.041
LIFELINE CONNECTING THOSE

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:04.209
STRUGGLING IN POVERTY TO

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:06.645
ESSENTIAL RESOURCES. IT SERVES

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.514
AS THE CORNERSTONE OF EFFORTS TO

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.982
ADDRESS THE PRESSING NEEDS OF

00:19:10.048 --> 00:19:12.351
COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA,

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.887
ESPECIALLY IN TULARE COUNTY.

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.255
THIS ESSENTIAL FUNDING EMPOWERS

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.223
LOCAL AGENCIES STATEWIDE TO

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.392
TACKLE THEIR UNIQUE POVERTY

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:21.793
CHALLENGES. WHETHER IT'S HOUSING

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.161
INSTABILITY HAS BEEN SHARED,

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:25.564
FOOD INSECURITY OR THE NEED FOR

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:26.865
EMPLOYMENT PATHWAYS. THE

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:30.469
COMMUNITY DECIDES THOSE AREAS.

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.971
ITS INHERENT FLEXIBILITY IS

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:34.506
INVALUABLE, ALLOWING RESOURCES

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.475
TO BE DIRECTED PRECISELY WHERE

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:39.411
THE NEED IS GREATEST. THIS

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:40.579
ADAPTABILITY IS CRITICAL IN

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:41.580
RESPONDING TO IMMEDIATE

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:42.681
CHALLENGES LIKE THE CENTRAL

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:44.616
VALLEY. WE'VE HAD THE FREEZE.

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:46.285
WE'VE HAD THE DROUGHT. WE'VE HAD

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:50.255
FLOODING DURING THE DROUGHT. WE

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:54.526
INSTALLED 752 2000 GALLON TANKS

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:56.695
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD NO WATER.

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:58.163
THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.732
WITHOUT CSBG AND LEVERAGING

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:01.700
OTHER RESOURCES IN THE

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:05.237
COMMUNITY. CSBG PRIORITIZES

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:07.539
MEASURABLE, LOCALLY DEFINED

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.041
OUTCOMES, MOVING BEYOND A ONE

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:11.109
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. THIS

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:13.579
ENABLES AGENCY TO BLEND CSBG

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:15.480
FUNDING WITH OTHER RESOURCES TO

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.716
MAXIMIZE OUTCOMES IN THE HEART

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:19.051
OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY,

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:21.587
SPECIFICALLY IN TULARE COUNTY.

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:23.622
CSBG IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:26.625
THIS REGION, A TOP AGRICULTURAL

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:29.428
PRODUCER AND IS COMPARABLE IN

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:32.197
THIS TO THE SIZE OF THE STATE OF

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:33.699
CONNECTICUT, FACES WIDESPREAD

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:36.234
AND PERSISTENT POVERTY. OUR

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.070
OVERALL POVERTY RATE STANDS AT

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.672
APPROXIMATELY 17%, ALMOST 18%

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.841
WITH CHILDREN. POVERTY LIVING IN

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:46.745
POVERTY AT 24%, WELL ABOVE STATE

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:48.013
AVERAGES. THE COMMUNITY RELIES

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.649
ON FLEXIBLE ANTI-POVERTY FUNDING

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:52.517
TO UPLIFT THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:55.053
POPULATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY. AS

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.855
CSET, CSBG DIRECTLY SUPPORTS

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.724
VITAL STAFFING NEEDS AND ACCESS

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.459
TO SERVICES IN RURAL

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:01.893
COMMUNITIES. CURRENTLY, NONE OF

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.228
OUR OTHER GRANTS COVER THE

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:04.663
PERSONNEL COSTS FOR ESSENTIAL

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.531
FUNCTIONS LIKE GRANT WRITING. WE

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:09.134
WOULD HAVE NO GRANT WRITERS

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:13.372
WITHOUT CSBG. CSBG HELPS THOSE

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:15.173
CRITICAL PERSONNEL AND HELPS

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.308
MAINTAIN SUPPORT IN SMALL

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.810

EARLIMART AND CUTLER-OROSI,

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.448
WHICH HAVE ACCESS TO NO

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:24.883
TRANSPORTATION AT TIMES AND CAN

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.753
LITERALLY TAKE A FULL DAY TO GO

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:30.689
FROM PORTERVILLE TO VISALIA BACK

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:33.558
TO PORTERVILLE, WHICH IS ONLY 40

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:37.429
MILES EACH WAY. THESE OFFICES

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.297
SERVE AS VITAL LIFELINES FOR

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.767
RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:43.301
RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION IN A

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:59.151

RESIDENTS ARE TELLING US WHAT

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:02.354
THE NEEDS ARE. AGENCIES ARE

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:03.755
SUPPORTING HOUSING STABILITY,

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.957
UTILITY ASSISTANCE, FOOD ACCESS,

00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:06.958
EMPLOYMENT PATHWAYS AND

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:08.460
CONNECTING SAFETY NET AID,

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:09.895
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN SMALL

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:12.397

ARE TRANSFORMING LIVES AND

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:20.272
ELEVATING THEIR COMMUNITY. IN

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:21.440
CLOSING, THE COMMUNITY SERVICE

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.075
BLOCK GRANT EMPOWERS

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:24.509
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CCSA TO FIGHT

TULARE COUNTY OVER ALMOST 14,000

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:33.185
LIVES EACH YEAR IN TULARE

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:35.387
COUNTY. WE URGE YOU TO CHAMPION

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:36.455
CONTINUED ROBUST FUNDING FOR

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:38.623
THIS ESSENTIAL LIFELINE.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:39.991
RECOGNIZING ITS IRREPLACEABLE

00:22:40.058 --> 00:22:41.460
ROLE IN BUILDING STRONGER

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:43.929
COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:46.164
CSBG IS THAT LINK. IT THREADS IT

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:48.333
ALL TOGETHER FOR ALL OF OUR

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.836
AGENCIES AND TO LET YOU KNOW IT

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:53.371
ASSURES ACCESS. IT ASSURES THAT

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:54.706
COMMUNITY HAS LOCAL CONTROL OF

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:56.641
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE IN THEIR OWN

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:59.778
COMMUNITY. AND FOR US, CSBG IS

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:03.181
ESSENTIAL. IT IS LITERALLY $1

00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:05.684
MILLION OUT OF A $39 MILLION

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:07.352
BUDGET. IT LEVERAGES THAT MUCH

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:08.854
BECAUSE WITHOUT OUR GRANT

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.689
WRITERS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:12.090
ACCESS ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:13.658
WITHOUT RURAL COMMUNITY OFFICES,

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:15.694
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONNECT

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:16.928
WITH FAMILIES OR FOR INDIVIDUALS

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:19.598
WHO NEED ACCESS TO FOOD. WE ALSO

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:21.466
ARE ABLE TO OPERATE EIGHT SENIOR

00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:22.534

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:26.037
SENIOR CENTERS, WE FED 155,000

00:23:26.104 --> 00:23:28.573

THE WORK THAT IS GETTING DONE IN

00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:35.781
TULARE COUNTY. I JUST WANT TO

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:37.282
EMPHASIZE CSBG, AGAIN, IS MORE

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:39.084
THAN A GRANT. IT REALLY IS A

00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:40.886
LIFELINE FOR MANY OF THE

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:41.953
COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES IN OUR

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.122

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:50.328
QUESTIONS. AND I, I BELIEVE

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:51.296
WE'LL HAVE SOME OTHER MEMBERS

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:53.098

THESE CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED THE

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:15.266
MAINTAIN A WATCHFUL EYE OF THE

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:19.204
ELDERLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AS

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.706
YOU NOTED, A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:22.607
IS LEVERAGED SO MUCH TO MAKE

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:24.309
SUCH AN IMPACT. MR. KNIGHT,

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:26.244
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW CAL

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:30.582
KAPPA HAS SUPPORTED ENTITIES

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:32.050
WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CAL

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:35.387
AIM? YEAH, THANKS. ABSOLUTELY.

00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:38.189
SO WHEN KELLY FIRST BEGAN, WE

00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:39.657
HAD THREE AGENCIES KIND OF JUMP

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:42.527
ON BOARD QUITE, QUITE QUICKLY.

00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:44.095
AND WHAT WE REALIZED IS THAT

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:46.331
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENHANCED

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.132
CARE MANAGEMENT OR THE COMMUNITY

00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:48.299
SUPPORTS THAT, THAT FALL UNDER

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.001
KELLY, IT MATCHES EXACTLY TO THE

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.503
COMMUNITY ACTION MODEL. AND SO

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:53.104
WHAT WE DID IS CAL KAPPA WAS

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.806
FIRST TO REALLY TRY TO CREATE

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:55.907
SOME AWARENESS AND SPACES TO

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:58.109
LEARN FROM THOSE THREE AGENCIES

00:27:58.176 --> 00:27:59.911
THAT FIRST TOOK IT ON, YOU KNOW,

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:02.680
RIGHT AWAY. NOW WE SIT AT 20

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:03.815
DIFFERENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:06.317
STATE THAT OPERATE CAL SUPPORTS,

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:07.452
AND WHAT WE CONTINUE TO DO FOR

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.821
THAT IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE

00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:11.689
HELP PARTNER MATCH THEM. SO WHEN

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:13.358
THEY'RE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW,

00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:14.692
THE PATH PROGRAM OR THEY'RE

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:17.362
LOOKING AT WHAT DIFFERENT

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:20.899
ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING THAT CAL

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:23.234
AND THAT COUNTY, THEY'RE ABLE TO

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:23.902
MATCH WITH THEM REALLY, REALLY

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:24.969
QUICK FOR THE LAST PIECE OF THAT

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:26.738
IS REALLY TRYING TO LINE IT UP

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:27.739
WITH THE PERFORMANCE ALIGNMENT.

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:29.074
SO MAKING SURE THAT

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.841
ORGANIZATIONS UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:30.942
CAL AIMS TARGETS ARE, HOW THEY

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:32.243
MATCH WITH THE COMMUNITY ACTION

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.545
TARGETS. AND THEN, OF COURSE,

00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:35.447
THE LAST THING IS JUST REALLY

00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:36.648
MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:28:36.714 --> 00:28:37.715
FUNDING AND THE CAPACITY TO

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:39.818
NAVIGATE THAT TYPE OF BILLING

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.886
VERSUS GRANTS AND THINGS OF THAT

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:46.191
NATURE. AT ONE ADDITIONAL

00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:49.160
QUESTION, YOU KNOW, FUNDING IS

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:50.929
KIND OF IN A STATE OF FLUX RIGHT

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:53.565
NOW. AND THANKFULLY, CONGRESS

00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:56.267
WAS ABLE TO PREVENT THE PROPOSED

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.970
CUT TO CSBG. BUT WE KNOW THAT

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:01.272
THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT MAY

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:02.474
BE ON THE TABLE NEXT YEAR. AND

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.277
SO HOW ARE WE COMMUNICATING WITH

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:09.214
PARTICIPATING AGENCIES ABOUT THE

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.416
POTENTIAL FOR A COMPLETE

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:13.651
ELIMINATION OF FUNDING OR A

00:29:13.718 --> 00:29:15.687
REDUCTION IN FUNDING? HOW ARE WE

00:29:15.753 --> 00:29:18.590
PLANNING FOR THAT? QUITE

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:20.358
EXTENSIVELY. OKAY, I HOPE I

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:21.659
MEAN, THAT'S A TOPIC OF

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:24.762
DISCUSSION THESE DAYS. SO I

00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:26.231
THINK DAVID KNIGHT MENTIONED IN

00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:27.765
HIS REMARKS, WE MAINTAIN A VERY

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.134
CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.068
OUR COMMUNITY BASED

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:31.302
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE FUND

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:34.539
THROUGH CSBG. WE HAVE AN

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.341
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT'S

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:37.308
REPRESENTATIVE OF SELECT

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.476
AGENCIES AND EXECUTIVE

00:29:38.543 --> 00:29:39.844
DIRECTORS, WHERE WE'VE TAKEN UP

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:41.312
THIS CONVERSATION ON MANY

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:43.848
OCCASIONS TO TALK ABOUT LIFE

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:45.617
WITH A REDUCTION OR LIFE. IF

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:47.785
THERE WAS AN ELIMINATION. AND

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:49.888
THROUGH THOSE DISCUSSIONS, THERE

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:52.357
WAS SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONAL

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.725
LEADERS TALKED ABOUT THE THINGS

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:55.660
THAT THEY WERE DOING TO PREPARE.

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:57.428
AND I THINK THAT INFORMATION

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.197
SHARING WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:01.599
AND HELPFUL. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.101
PROVIDE WE CONVENE QUARTERLY AS

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:05.770
A NETWORK WITH OUR AGENCIES TO

00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:07.305
PROVIDE UPDATES AND SHARE SHARE

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:09.073
OUR BEST PRACTICES. WE ALSO USE

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.775
AS A FORUM TO ALSO PROVIDE

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:14.112
CRITICAL UPDATES ON FUNDING.

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:15.847
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK RIGHT NOW

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:18.650
WE SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:20.518
TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE CURRENT

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:21.719
ADMINISTRATIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT

00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:24.489
WE'RE IN WITH POLICY CHANGES,

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.758
THE THREATS OF FEDERAL

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:28.126
REDUCTION, YOU KNOW, THE IMPACTS

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.594
OF LAYOFFS THAT WE'VE HAD ON

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:32.297
WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS.

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:34.566
YOU KNOW, IT DEFINITELY IS.

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:35.967
THERE'S A LARGE VOLUME OF THINGS

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.802
THAT ARE COMING AT US THESE

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:39.037
DAYS, AND WE ARE WORKING

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:40.405
TOGETHER TO TRY TO MANAGE OUR

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:42.907
WAY THROUGH THEM. SO I THINK

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:44.442
RIGHT NOW, THOSE ARE THE THINGS

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:46.211
THAT WE'RE DOING AND WILL

00:30:46.277 --> 00:30:48.580
CONTINUE TO DO GOING FORWARD.

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.548
OKAY. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:52.584
BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU FOR

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.885

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:54.752
OUR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.621
AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING UP FOR

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.723
CSBG FUNDED AGENCIES NEXT TO

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.024
TALK ABOUT THE WORK THEY'RE

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.492
DOING IN THE IMPACT THEY'RE

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.794
CREATING IN COMMUNITIES. AND SO

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.695
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MARLA

00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:06.998

ADDITIONAL DOLLARS, AND FORCE

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.140
REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES THAT

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:25.909
TOUCH FAMILIES. IT WOULD ALSO

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:28.144
PROVIDE FEWER PATHWAYS OUT OF

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:31.448
POVERTY. IN CLOSING, CSG FUNDING

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:33.550
IS NOT JUST A LINE ITEM IN A

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:35.318
BUDGET FOR THE FAMILIES IN OUR

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:36.520
COMMUNITIES. IT IS HOPE. IT IS

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:38.522
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:40.357
INSTABILITY AND STABILITY,

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.192
BETWEEN GENERATIONAL POVERTY AND

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:44.728
THE CHANCE OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY.

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.463
EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED THROUGH

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.065
CSG IS TRACKED AND TRANSLATES

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:51.101

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:34.377
POVERTY IS NOT A PERSONAL

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.812

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.647

STRUCTURE ISN'T JUST ABOUT

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:16.680
COMPLIANCE, IT'S A REFLECTION OF

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:18.548
OUR BELIEF THAT THOSE CLOSEST TO

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.550

CLOSEST TO CREATING SOLUTIONS.

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:25.255
CSBG IS MORE THAN JUST A FUNDING

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:27.457
SOURCE. IT CREATES A FRAMEWORK

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:29.859
THAT TIES OUR WORK TOGETHER.

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.327
CSPGS LOCALLY DRIVEN PROCESS IS

00:55:31.394 --> 00:55:33.029
THE BACKBONE OF HOW WE DECIDE

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:34.998

OUR COMMUNITY IDENTIFIES AS

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:49.646
PRIORITIES. A FAMILY A FAMILY

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:51.448

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:01.257
US TO INTEGRATE THESE SERVICES

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:03.093
INTO A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM, ONE

00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:04.794
THAT REMOVES BARRIERS AND HELPS

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.296
FAMILIES ACCESS THE RIGHT MIX OF

00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:08.264
SUPPORT IN ONE PLACE, AS WELL AS

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:09.466
REFERRALS TO OUR COMMUNITY

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:11.301
PARTNERS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:13.236
FAMILY STABILITY, WE DON'T MEAN

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:15.004
IT GOING ALONE. WE MEAN CREATING

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:16.473
THE CONDITIONS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:18.475
THE TOOLS, SUPPORT, AND

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.276
OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE. IN THIS

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:22.145
WAY, CSBG IS A VITAL TOOL FOR

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:23.213
BUILDING COMMUNITIES THAT

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:24.881
THRIVE, WHERE ALL FAMILIES ARE

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:26.449
INCLUDED AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

00:56:26.516 --> 00:56:28.251
TO SUCCEED. SO ON BEHALF OF OUR

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:29.619
MEMBERS, OUR STAFF AND OUR

00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:31.454

THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. THANK

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:41.965
ONE. I THINK YOU'RE REALLY I HAD

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:42.899
SOME PREPARED QUESTIONS. I THINK

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:44.501
YOU ALL TOUCHED ON THE THINGS I

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:48.738
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT. YOU EACH

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:49.906
PROVIDE DIFFERENT SERVICES TO

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:51.708
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE

00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:55.979
RURAL, URBAN, I GUESS. I GUESS

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:58.448
MY QUESTION IS, HOW ARE YOU ABLE

00:56:58.515 --> 00:56:59.582
TO BRAID THESE RESOURCES WITH

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:00.984
THE OTHER RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:03.153
ABLE TO THROUGH PHILANTHROPY,

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:05.722
THROUGH OTHER GRANTS? AND COULD

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:07.423
YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.259
WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO ELABORATE

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:11.761
HOW YOU MAY BE PREPARING FOR THE

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:12.829
POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF NOT JUST

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:15.265
OTHER FEDERAL CUTS, BUT ALSO THE

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:17.767
POTENTIAL CUTS, IF,

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:20.737
UNFORTUNATELY, CONGRESS

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:23.706
PROGRESSES WITH A REDUCTION OR

00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:27.210
ELIMINATION OF CSBG. TOUGH

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:31.915
QUESTIONS. ANYONE? ANYONE WHO

00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:33.783
WANTS TO ELABORATE. YEAH, YEAH.

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.653
SO THE SO THE QUESTION ABOUT

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:39.889
BRAIDING FUNDING. SO YEAH, WE

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.524
BASICALLY WE TAKE OUR FUNDING

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:44.861
AND WE BUDGET IT TO DIFFERENT

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.496
DIVISIONS. SO WE GIVE ABOUT $1

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:47.764
MILLION TO OUR FARMWORKER

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:49.199
DIVISION BECAUSE IT'S MIGRANT,

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:51.000
SEASONAL, FARMWORKER FOCUSED,

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:53.403
AND WE ALLOW OUR FARMWORKERS TO

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:56.105
BE ENROLLED IN TRAINING WORK

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:56.673
EXPERIENCE. AND DURING THAT

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:59.375
TIME, WE USE A LOT OF CSBG MONEY

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:00.577
TO OFFER THE SUPPORT SERVICES

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:02.478
THAT ALLOW THEM TO GET TO THEIR

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:03.646
TRAINING AND ALLOW THEM TO

00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:05.415
OVERCOME THOSE BARRIERS. AND

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:07.283
THEN WE ALSO USE OUR MONEY, AS I

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.352
SAID, JUST TO SUPPLEMENT OUR

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:10.520
SMALL PROJECTS THAT COME IN WITH

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:12.255
MINIMAL BUDGETS BUT ARE HUGE

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:13.823
IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.659
WE USE CSBG TO HELP THE GRANTS

00:58:16.726 --> 00:58:18.294
THAT DON'T NECESSARILY FUND

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:20.196
THEMSELVES COMPLETELY. AND THEN

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:23.333
WE ALSO USE A LOT OF OUR MONEY

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:25.602
FOR TO SUPPLEMENT OUR CTE

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:27.437
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND DO

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:29.873
OUR ESL AND OUR ACADEMIC

00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:30.907
CLASSES, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:33.176
QUITE ENOUGH MONEY TO MEET THE

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:36.379
NEEDS AS FAR AS HOW WE ARE

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:39.282
PREPARING, CAL HAS BEEN VERY

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:41.017
INSTRUMENTAL IN TALKING TO

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:42.485
PROVIDERS AND KIND OF LETTING

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:45.321
THEM KNOW THE MESSAGE I GIVE

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:47.790
STAFF IS DON'T PANIC, BUT BE

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:51.060
READY. AND SO WE HAVE

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:52.595
CONTINGENCY PLANS IN PLACE IF WE

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:56.599
LOSE OUR FUNDING, WE REALLY HAVE

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:59.035
SOME PLANS IN PLACE TO CUT

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:01.604
STAFFING. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:03.706
OUTSOURCING SOME OF OUR KEY HR

00:59:03.773 --> 00:59:05.508
AND FISCAL COMPONENTS IF WE HAVE

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:08.378
TO. WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:10.513
BUDGETING RIGHT NOW AND NOT

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.048
BUYING THINGS WE DON'T

GETS REDUCED, WE'LL BE ABLE TO

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.865

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:05.802
CASE MANAGEMENT WITH OUR WIOA

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:07.770
AND CSG PROGRAMING. ALONG WITH

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:10.039

BRAID THAT WITH THE WIOA. AND

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:22.685
THEN WE ALSO HAVE SOME

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:23.619
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO GO WITH

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:24.554
THAT AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.590
THEY'RE SELF SUFFICIENCY. OTHER

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:28.591
WAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN PREPARING

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:29.525
IS WE'VE BEEN ACTUALLY, YOU

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.260

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:33.029
FOUNDATIONS. UP UNTIL FIVE YEARS

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:35.264
AGO, WE WERE ABOUT 85, 95%

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.033
FEDERALLY FUNDED. WE'VE EXPANDED

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:41.671
THAT NOW TO BE ABOUT 70% OVER 70

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.706

WITH OUR STAFF. WE'RE A VERY

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.089
SMALL STAFF, I'M SURE AS MUCH AS

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.925
ANY OF THE CCAS ARE DON'T PANIC.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.660

DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS THAT MAY

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:13.703
COME TO MAKE DIFFICULT

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.372
DECISIONS, BUT THAT'S ONE WAY

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:19.442
THAT WE'RE PREPARING FOR IF AND

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.877
FINGERS CROSSED. NOT THAT THE

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.779
FUNDING IS REDUCED AND OR CUT AS

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.148
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:26.449
ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:31.354
AT HAND. I'LL GO NEXT. OKAY, NOT

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:34.557
EVERYONE HAS TO SPEAK, BUT BUT I

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.392
THINK THIS IS HELPFUL. I MEAN, I

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:39.195
THINK THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:39.929
CONSIDERING, I MEAN, THANKFULLY

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:41.431
THE MONEY IS GOING TO CONTINUE

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:43.332
THIS YEAR, BUT THERE'S THIS

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:44.667
LOOMING THREAT THAT WE'RE THAT

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:47.870
WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND SO I

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:51.808
APPRECIATE THE DETAIL. YEAH.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.309
THANK YOU. I'LL SPEAK MAYBE ON

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.378
BEHALF OF COUNTIES AND PUBLIC

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:59.849
ENTITIES. SO WE BECAUSE WE RUN

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:01.584
ALL OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES,

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:03.686
PUBLICLY FUNDED SOCIAL SERVICE

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.254
PROGRAMS, WE REALLY APPRECIATE

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:07.323
THE CDBG FUNDING BECAUSE WE USE

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.625
IT TO FUND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.327
WHO COME TO US WITH NEEDS AND

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.062
ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PUBLIC

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.897
PROGRAMS FOR ONE REASON OR

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:15.531
ANOTHER. USUALLY, THE LACK OF

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:16.966
ELIGIBILITY IS IMMIGRATION

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.601
STATUS OR INCOME THAT IS JUST

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:19.602
SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE FEDERAL

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:21.838
POVERTY LEVEL, WHICH IS WAY TOO

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:24.640
LOW. SO CSBG GIVES US JUST ONE

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.342
MORE WAY THAT WE CAN SUPPORT

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.277
COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN ANSWER TO

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.345
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WOULD

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.813
WE DO WITH REDUCED FUNDING, I'M

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.482
GOING TO RESPOND TO THIS FOR

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:33.950
CSBG, BUT ALSO FOR MEDICAID AND

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:35.718
SNAP AND OUR OTHER FEDERALLY

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:38.287
FUNDED PROGRAMS, YOU KNOW,

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.756
CONGREGATE MEALS, ETC. IN CONTRA

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.225
COSTA COUNTY, OUR SOCIAL

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:44.460
SERVICES ARE 97% STATE AND

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.896
FEDERALLY FUNDED. THE COUNTY

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.731
DOES NOT HAVE MONEY. COUNTIES DO

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.500
NOT HAVE MONEY TO BACKFILL STATE

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.201
AND FEDERAL FUNDING. WHEN WE

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.103
LOSE STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING,

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:55.638
THAT IS A REDUCTION IN SERVICES

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.306
FOR THE COMMUNITY, AND IT'S A

01:02:57.373 --> 01:02:59.075
REDUCTION IN EMPLOYEES FOR US.

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:00.309
SO THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:02.311
PEOPLE BEING LAID OFF. NOW, THAT

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.547
SAID, WE ARE REALLY WORKING

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.948
INTERNALLY TO BRAINSTORM IDEAS

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:08.084
ABOUT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. OUR

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.619
BOARD HAS INVESTED RECENTLY

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:12.155
ABOUT $2.5 MILLION IN

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.623
APPLICATION SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:14.957
THAT WE ARE FULLY UTILIZING

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:16.526
MEDICAID AND SNAP, AND THAT

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:17.560
EVERYBODY THAT'S ELIGIBLE IS ON

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.262
THAT. IS A COUNTY INVESTMENT NOT

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:21.597
REQUIRED, NOT MANDATED. AND THE

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:23.799
OTHER THING THAT WE'RE THINKING

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:24.467
ABOUT RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.569
IF WE'LL DO THIS. THIS IS JUST

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.604
AN IDEA AT THE MOMENT. BUT WE'RE

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.405
THINKING ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:30.506
NONPROFITS TO PROVIDE VOLUNTEER

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.642
SERVICES FOR PEOPLE. MEDI-CAL,

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.043
MEDICAID IS GOING TO REQUIRE HAS

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.678
A WORK REQUIREMENT FOR THE FIRST

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:36.913
TIME EVER. RIGHT. AND THAT'S

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.447
GOING TO MIRROR THE SNAP WORK

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:39.649
REQUIREMENTS. AND PART OF WHAT

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:41.517
CAN MEET THAT WORK REQUIREMENT

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:42.451
IS VOLUNTEER WORK. SO WE MAY

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:43.786
SUPPORT OUR NONPROFIT

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:44.520
ORGANIZATIONS IN PROVIDING

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.789
VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:47.924
PEOPLE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO THINK

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.126
ABOUT THINGS TO DO. BUT I WANT

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:51.460
TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT FOR

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:52.395
COUNTIES, FEDERAL AND STATE

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.830
FUNDING REDUCTIONS ARE DIRE AND

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:56.199
CANNOT BE BACKFILLED BY

01:03:56.265 --> 01:04:00.736
COUNTIES. I THANK YOU ALL FOR

01:04:00.803 --> 01:04:01.804
YOUR RESPONSES. I THINK IT JUST

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.272

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:05.374
IMPACT THAT OUR CSBG FUNDED

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.543
AGENCIES AND PARTNERS ARE, ARE

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:08.578
DOING IN THE COMMUNITIES, AND

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:10.746
JUST HOW WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.648
FOR THE FUTURE. WE HAVE TO TAKE

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:13.816
A QUICK RECESS AND THEN WE'LL

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:14.750

FROM CHICO, CALIFORNIA, AND I'M

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:32.328
ONE OF THE THREE FOUNDERS OF A

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:33.596
PROGRAM UP THERE CALLED

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:34.764
ESPLANADE HOUSE. IT WAS

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.999
EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. THIS WAS

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:41.971
STARTED OVER 25 YEARS AGO. I

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:44.540
BASICALLY WANTED TO ADDRESS THE

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.442
ISSUES OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:48.277

BEFORE YOU APPROVE THIS 20 2627

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.451
STATE PLAN, YOU WILL AT THE VERY

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.653
LEAST ENSURE THAT CCAS FOLLOW

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.022
THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:01.624
FOR THEM IN CALIFORNIA.

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:02.925
CURRENTLY, IT APPEARS THAT CAAS

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.727
CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.228
CALIFORNIA CODE THEY WOULD LIKE

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:07.797
TO FOLLOW AND WHICH ONES THEY

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:10.433
WOULD NOT. BUT ONE SMALL, SIMPLE

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:12.935
ACTION ON YOUR PART IS ALL THAT

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.437
IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THIS

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:18.007
WILL NO LONGER BE THE CASE. I

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.775
GOING TO HAVE TO SKIP ALL THIS

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:24.447
HISTORY. I WILL TELL YOU THOUGH

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:36.492

OPERATE A HOMELESS SHELTER FOR

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:46.168
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. WE

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:47.937
STARTED OUT IN AN OLD MOTEL. WE

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:50.106
ENDED UP BUILDING 60 APARTMENT

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.874
UNITS, ADMINISTRATION BUILDING,

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.442
CHILD CARE CENTER, PARTNERED

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.444
WITH THE UNIVERSITY. WE HAD A

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.013
REALLY GREAT THING GOING.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.815
UNFORTUNATELY, THE OTHER

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.951
PROGRAMS THAT CAA ALSO WERE

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:04.520
RUNNING AT THE TIME BEGAN TO

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:07.690
FAIL. THEY LOST THE HEAD START

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.659
PROJECT CONTRACT, THE SENIOR

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:11.727
NUTRITION PROGRAM, MEALS ON

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:14.563
WHEELS PROGRAM, THE ENERGY

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.399
EFFICIENCY TRAINING ACADEMY THAT

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.901
WAS BUILT WITH OUR FUNDS BUT

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:20.936
NEVER GOT OFF THE GROUND, AND

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:23.105
THE FEEDING AMERICA CONTRACT. SO

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.306
WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.442
WHAT WAS HAPPENING FINANCIALLY.

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:30.813
WE OFFERED WE WERE FUNDRAISING

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.616
$150,000 A YEAR. ABOUT 25% OF

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:36.485
THE BUDGET, AND CEA COULD GET

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.754
THE REMAINING FUNDS FROM BLOCK

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.556
GRANT FUNDS AND, YOU KNOW, CITY,

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:41.590
COUNTY MONIES, WHATEVER THEY

01:07:41.657 --> 01:07:43.392
DID, ALL THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING,

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:44.960
WE DID ALL THEIR FUNDRAISING FOR

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.362
THEM. SO IT WAS KIND OF A

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:49.498
PERFECT PARTNERSHIP. BUT WHEN

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:57.373
THE PROBLEM STARTED. WE WERE

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.644
SHUT OUT FROM FINANCIAL

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.646
DOCUMENTS. AND I'M JUST I'M

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.481
REALLY SORRY THAT I CAN'T READ

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:06.715
THIS WHOLE THING BECAUSE I'M

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.617
REALLY COUNTING ON YOU GUYS TO

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:11.387
CORRECT THE CALIFORNIA CODE

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:13.222
100765, WHICH STATES THAT ALL

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:15.691
COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES ARE

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.392
REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE FREEDOM

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:19.829
OF INFORMATION ACT. AND I THINK

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.263
IF YOU CAN SUBMIT YOUR WRITTEN

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:22.998
STATEMENT BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:25.067
ONE MEMBER OF TWO, I KNOW IT'S

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:26.902
DISAPPOINTING, ACTUALLY MORE

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.270
BENEFICIAL IF WE GET YOUR

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.139
WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT WE CAN

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:31.640
DISTRIBUTE THAT TO ALL THE

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.375
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CAN I

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:35.878
DO THAT? I DO HAVE A COPY HERE.

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:37.580
I DID MAKE A FEW LITTLE CHANGES,

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:39.181
BUT I CAN EMAIL IT JUST AS

01:08:39.248 --> 01:08:40.716
EASILY. OR IF THAT'S TO THE TO

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.885
THE COMMITTEE, AND WE CAN MAKE

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:43.452
SURE IT GETS DISTRIBUTED TO

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:44.520
MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES. IF

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:47.456
YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY, THE

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:48.123
GENTLEMAN HERE WOULD BE HAPPY TO

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:49.592
TAKE IT AND PROVIDE A COPY FOR

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:51.660
THE RECORD. OKAY, WOULD I BE

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:53.562
EMAILING LIKE SPENCER DAVIS, THE

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.764

MAKE SURE THAT SHE HAS THE

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:08.177
INFORMATION TO SUBMIT HER

01:09:08.244 --> 01:09:11.247
TESTIMONY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE? OKAY. I

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.327
JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.796
BEING HERE TODAY, OUR WITNESSES,

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:28.597
FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.332
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CSBG IS AND

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.800
THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:32.434
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA, IN

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:35.037
PARTICULAR, THE PROGRAMS WHICH

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:41.110
ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR. LOW INCOME

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.679
SENIORS, YOUTH PERSONS WITH

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:44.380
DISABILITIES THROUGHOUT THE

01:09:44.446 --> 01:09:45.614
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'LL JUST

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:47.583
PUT THIS IN CONTEXT. I WAS THE

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:48.817
MAYOR OF BERKELEY FOR EIGHT

01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:52.588
YEARS. WE ARE A CSBG AGENCY, AND

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.390
I CAN JUST TELL YOU ON A

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.292
PERSONAL LEVEL HOW IMPACTFUL

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.693
THOSE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN, NOT

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.762
JUST FOR OUR EMPLOYMENT

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.297
PROGRAMS, BUT ALSO TO SUPPORT

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:03.132
THE WORK WE'VE DONE AROUND

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:04.033
REDUCING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.901
IN OUR COMMUNITY. I KNOW THE

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.670
IMPACT THAT THAT HAS, NOT THE

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.606
LOCAL LEVEL. WORKING WITH

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:12.474
PARTNER AGENCIES, AND I KNOW

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.376
THAT THAT IMPACT IS STATEWIDE.

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:16.745
SO I JUST WANT TO JUST THANK THE

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.547
DEPARTMENT FOR THE AND THE AND

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:20.416
THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE ONGOING

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:22.418
WORK YOU'RE DOING TO SUPPORT

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:25.754
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AGENCIES

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:26.755
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:27.756
SPENDING THESE DOLLARS, THAT

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:29.325
WE'RE TRACKING OUTCOMES, THAT

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:30.826
CALIFORNIA IS BEING COMPETITIVE.

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.561
I THINK THE BIG ISSUE IS

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.430
OBVIOUSLY HOW WE CONTINUE TO

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:36.565
SUSTAIN THIS INVESTMENT. AND

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:37.566
THIS IS, I THINK, A REALLY

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.368
CRITICAL, CRITICAL TIME FOR OUR

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:40.436
STATE. POVERTY IS NOT

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:43.072
DECREASING, SADLY, DESPITE THE

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:44.807
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING.

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.375
AND WE HAVE, AS I NOTED AT THE

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:48.143
BEGINNING OF THE HEARING, SOME

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.178
OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:50.713
HOMELESSNESS OF ANY STATE IN THE

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:51.647
UNITED STATES, DESPITE THE

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:52.514
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.283
SPENT AND THE CONTINUED FOCUS

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:55.517
THAT WE HAVE IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.386
AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM. SO THERE'S

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:59.955
A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. AND I

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:01.724
THINK IT'S BECOMING ON ALL OF

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:04.560
US, NOT JUST THE LEGISLATURE,

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:05.828
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALL

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:07.496
OF OUR PARTNERS THROUGHOUT

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.665
CALIFORNIA, TO LOOK AT HOW WE

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:10.599
CAN SUPPORT EACH OTHER, TO MAKE

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:11.834
SURE WE CONTINUE THESE

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.536
INVESTMENTS. SO ONCE AGAIN, I

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:16.472
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HEAR

01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:17.439
FROM COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY TO

01:11:17.506 --> 01:11:19.041
HELP INFORM THIS, THESE

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:19.608
COMMITTEES, AS WE'RE MAKING

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:21.210
THESE IMPORTANT POLICY

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:22.678
DECISIONS, I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:24.380
SEEING HOW THE SERVICES PROVIDED

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:27.016
WITH CSPG FUNDING CONTINUE TO

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.684
ADAPT TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.919
OF OUR STATE AND HOW WE AS A

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:33.455
LEGISLATURE CAN PARTNER WITH YOU

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.624
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:36.125
CONTINUE THESE CRITICAL

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:36.725
INVESTMENTS. AND SO I THINK I

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.394
SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.429
THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:41.030
COMMITTEE AND SAY, THANK YOU

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:42.831
VERY MUCH FOR THE WORK YOU DO.

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.900
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.803
AND WITH THAT, I WILL NOW

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:48.504
ADJOURN THIS JOINT OVERSIGHT

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:52.574
COMMITTEE HEARING. AND WITH

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.443
THAT, THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:12:11.293
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
