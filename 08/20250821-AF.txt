AND BEING MUCH YOUNGER, MAYBE

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:13.162
30 FOR ME, WE WERE QUIETLY

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:15.731
FEELING OUR AGE AND HOW QUICKLY

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.800

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:20.335
LATER THAT DAY, BOB AND I

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:22.538
STEPPED INTO A SMALL SHOP TO

ERA. WE CHATTED WITH THE OWNER

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:32.147
ABOUT HOW MUCH WE ENJOYED THE

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:33.916
TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF THE

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:35.417
HAWAIIAN SUMMER FESTIVAL THAT

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:37.953

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.122
TOLD US THAT HEARING THAT MUSIC

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.390
ONLY REMINDS HIM OF THE

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:44.026
SWELTERING SUMMER HEAT. BOB

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.929
THEN ASKED HIM, HOW LONG HAS

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:49.264
HIS SHOP BEEN HERE? IT LOOKED

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.800
VERY WELL ESTABLISHED, THE

WITH A SMILE, HE ADDED, BUT I'M

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:02.244

A CD OF THE UNIQUE KYOTO SUMMER

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:17.760
FESTIVAL MUSIC THAT HE WOULD

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:20.229
NEVER PLAY. IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:22.331
MEETING THAT GAVE US A FRESH

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:24.066
OUTLOOK ON THE PASSING OF TIME,

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:26.869

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:26.300
MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS. THAT'S

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:27.902
WHY THE MAJORITY LEADER WAS

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.237
MAKING MOTIONS AND THE ONLY

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.005
PLACE THAT YOU CAN MAKE MOTIONS,

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:32.240
LIKE THE ONE THAT WAS JUST

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:34.342
PASSED TO BRING ACA TO THE

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:36.210
FLOOR IS DURING MOTIONS AND

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:37.178
RESOLUTIONS. NOW, ALBEIT YOU

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.247
HAVEN'T PUT IT UP THERE ON THE

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:42.150
SCREEN, WHICH IS CURIOUS TO ME,

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:43.184
BUT THE ONLY PLACE THAT WE

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:45.887
COULD EVER DO THESE KINDS OF

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:46.487
MOTIONS IS DURING MOTIONS AND

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.790
RESOLUTIONS. SO I FIND IT

01:28:48.856 --> 01:28:49.524
UNBELIEVABLE THAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:51.659
WE'RE NOT EMOTIONS AND

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.494
RESOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW. YOUR

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:54.495
POINT OF ORDER IS THE

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:56.531
UNBELIEVABILITY OF THIS. YES,

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:58.433
STATE YOUR POINT OF ORDER THAT

01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:00.802
WE ARE ACTUALLY IN MOTIONS AND

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.837
RESOLUTIONS. OTHERWISE. JUST A

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:03.404
MOMENT. JUST A MOMENT. MR.

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:04.172
GALLAGHER. MAJORITY LEADER

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:21.989
COULD NOT HAVE MADE HER MOTION.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:28.029
MR. GALLAGHER, ONCE THE

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:30.231
MAJORITY LEADER'S MOTION WAS

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:33.134
VOTED ON AND APPROVED, AND THAT

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.936
WAS CONSENT WAS WITHHELD AND WE

01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:37.905
VOTED ON IT AS A BODY. WE ARE

01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:39.340
THEN IN THE PORTION WHERE WE

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:41.075
ARE DEALING WITH ACR EIGHT, AND

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:43.611
WE MUST FIRST DISPENSE WITH ACR

01:29:43.678 --> 01:29:46.080

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:48.983
OTHER BILLS BEFORE THIS HOUSE.

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:52.854
YOUR POINT OF ORDER IS NOT WELL

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:53.721

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:02.563
RELATING TO REDISTRICTING.

RIVAS. LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR.

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:16.010
WE DON'T WANT THIS FIGHT, AND

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.211
WE DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS FIGHT.

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:19.247
BUT WITH OUR DEMOCRACY ON THE

01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:21.983
LINE, WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:24.252
RUN AWAY FROM THIS FIGHT. WE'RE

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:26.320
HERE TODAY BECAUSE PRESIDENT

01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:27.188
TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS IN TEXAS

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.624
AND OTHER STATES ARE ATTEMPTING

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:30.124
TO REDRAW CONGRESSIONAL

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:32.393
DISTRICTS MID-DECADE IN AN

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.861
EFFORT TO RIG THE UPCOMING

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:36.230
ELECTION. JUST LAST NIGHT, THE

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:38.166
TEXAS HOUSE PASSED THEIR PLAN

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:40.067
TO RIG THE 2026 ELECTION.

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:42.203
EARLIER YESTERDAY, FLORIDA

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.106
GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS DEMANDED

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.642
THAT HIS STATE IS OWED AN EXTRA

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.243
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT RIGHT

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:51.979
NOW. AND YOU KNOW THAT TRUMP

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:53.447
WILL DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.082
FULFILL THIS OUTRAGEOUS REQUEST.

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:56.484
AMERICANS AND CALIFORNIANS

DESERVE BETTER. AND ACA ET, THE

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.222
ELECTION RIGGING RESPONSE ACT

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.124
IS OUR RESPONSE TO THESE

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.625
UNDEMOCRATIC AND UN-AMERICAN

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:07.028
POWER GRABS. ACA ALLOWS FOR THE

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:09.964
TEMPORARY USE OF VOTER APPROVED

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:10.965
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:14.569
BOUNDARIES CONTAINED IN AB 604.

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:16.537
UNLIKE TEXAS, WHERE REPUBLICAN

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:18.172
POLITICIANS RAMMED THROUGH MAPS

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:19.440
AFTER ASSIGNING LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.042
TO TRAIL THEIR DEMOCRAT

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:23.945
COLLEAGUES, EVERY MOVEMENT.

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:26.180
EXCUSE ME, MR. BERMAN, BY ALL

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:27.114
MEANS, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:28.115
PATTERSON, STATE YOUR POINT OF

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:32.186

MR. SPEAKER. GOOD MORNING.

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:35.389
STATE YOUR POINT OF ORDER, SIR.

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:37.758
YES. WE HAVE BEEN ADMONISHED

01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:41.562
FOR MENTIONING PARTIES ON MR.

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:43.497
PATTERSON. STATE YOUR POINT OF

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:45.666
ORDER. THERE'S NO EXPLANATION

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.468
NEEDED. WHAT IS THE RULE THAT

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:50.671
IS BEING VIOLATED? YOUR RULE

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:53.107
THAT A PERSON SPEAKING MAY NOT

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:54.342
MENTION POLITICAL PARTIES. I

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:57.678
ASK THAT THE AUTHOR NO LONGER

01:31:57.745 --> 01:32:00.314
DO THAT. THAT IS NOT A RULE OF

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:02.550
THIS BODY. THAT IS A RULE OF

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:04.318
DECORUM. THE ISSUE WITH THIS

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:06.187
PARTICULAR MEASURE IS EFFECTS

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:08.289
POLITICAL PARTIES. WE'RE GOING

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:09.724
TO ALLOW THAT TODAY. WHAT I

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:12.393
SPOKE WITH EARLIER WAS SIMPLY

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.362
THAT YOU SHOULD NOT IMPUGN THE

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:16.464
MOTIVES OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. MR.

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:19.100
BERMAN, YOU MAY CONTINUE. THANK

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:21.903
YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AS I WAS

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.037
SAYING, UNLIKE TEXAS, WHERE

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:25.139
REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS RAMMED

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.507
THROUGH MAPS AFTER ASSIGNING

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:29.010
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRAIL THEIR

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.111
DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES, EVERY

01:32:30.177 --> 01:32:31.913
MOVEMENT, IT IS CALIFORNIA

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:33.314
VOTERS WHO WILL HAVE THE FINAL

01:32:33.381 --> 01:32:35.249
SAY WHETHER OR NOT THESE NEW

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:36.851
DISTRICT BOUNDARIES GET USED.

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:38.786
BECAUSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA, WE

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.922
RESPECT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS.

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:44.558
AFTER THE 2030 CENSUS, AC EIGHT

01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:45.092
RETURNS ALL CONGRESSIONAL

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:47.395
DISTRICT LINE DRAWING POWERS

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:48.296
BACK TO THE CITIZENS

01:32:48.362 --> 01:32:50.698
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. IN

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:53.334
ADDITION, ACR CALLS ON CONGRESS

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:56.170
TO PASS LEGISLATION AND PROPOSE

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.905
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO

01:32:57.972 --> 01:32:59.407
THE US CONSTITUTION TO REQUIRE

01:32:59.473 --> 01:33:01.709
THE USE OF FAIR, INDEPENDENT

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.444
AND NONPARTIZAN REDISTRICTING

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:05.012
IN EVERY STATE ACROSS THE

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:07.248
COUNTRY. NOW, HERE ARE SOME OF

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:09.083
THE ARGUMENTS WE'LL HEAR FROM

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:10.584
OUR COLLEAGUES FROM ACROSS THE

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:12.920
AISLE TODAY. FIRST, THIS WAS

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.288
DECIDED BY VOTERS WHO WERE

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:16.290
ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN 2010, AND

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:19.160
WE DON'T NEED TO REVISIT IT. AT

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.261
LEAST HALF OF THE VOTER

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.963
REGISTRATION FILE IS TOTALLY

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:25.199
NEW. IN 2025, OVER 10 MILLION

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.968
CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHO DID NOT

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.436
HAVE THE CHANCE TO VOTE ON THIS

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:31.405
AND HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD IN

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:32.239
2010. NOW, YOU MIGHT BE

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:33.474
WONDERING, WHO DOES THAT

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:34.976
INCLUDE? WE GOT A COUPLE OF

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:37.244
PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR TODAY. MY

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:39.613
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES FROM

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.214
TULARE AND CLOVIS, MY DEMOCRAT

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:42.149
COLLEAGUES FROM SAN JOSE AND LA.

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:44.385
NONE OF THEM WERE OLD ENOUGH TO

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:47.221
VOTE ON THIS IN 2010, AND I

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:48.422
THINK THEY SHOULD GET THE

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:51.225
CHANCE TO VOTE ON IT THIS YEAR.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:52.360
THEY WILL CLAIM THAT THIS COST

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:54.195
TOO MUCH MONEY. FIRST, THERE IS

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:57.531
NO COST TOO HIGH TO SAVE OUR

01:33:57.598 --> 01:33:59.266
DEMOCRACY. SECOND, THE RETURN

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:01.602
ON INVESTMENT OF THIS ELECTION

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:03.604
IS OFF THE CHARTS, SOMETHING

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.439
THAT WOULD MAKE THE VCS IN MY

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:07.108
DISTRICT BLUSH. TRUMP AND HIS

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:09.176
CRONIES HAVE TERRORIZED OUR

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:10.411
COMMUNITIES. THEY HAVE TARGETED

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:13.147
OUR WORLD CLASS INSTITUTIONS,

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:15.249
TRYING TO EXTRACT $1 BILLION

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:17.518
FROM UCLA ALONE. THEY HAVE

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:19.653
DECIMATED LOCAL ECONOMIES.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.088
THEY'VE EVEN EXTORTED

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:22.423
CALIFORNIA GROWN BUSINESSES

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:25.026
LIKE NVIDIA. AND I HAVE NOT

01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:27.261
HEARD ONE COMPLAINT FROM ANY

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:29.530
COLLEAGUE FROM ACROSS THE AISLE

01:34:29.597 --> 01:34:32.533
TO THESE ACTIONS THAT HAVE COST

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.034
CALIFORNIA BILLIONS AND

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.835
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY'LL

01:34:34.902 --> 01:34:37.605
ARGUE THAT THERE'S NO URGENCY

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:40.641
TO ACT. WAKE UP. THE CRISIS IS

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:42.276
HERE AND OUR DEMOCRACY IS UNDER

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:46.213
ATTACK. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.182
TAKING ADVICE ON OUR DEMOCRACY

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:49.683
FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN, SOMEONE

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.852
WHO LITERALLY KILLS HIS

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:54.355
POLITICAL OPPONENTS. AND HE'S

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:56.357
NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE QUIET

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:58.159
ABOUT THIS. HE'S BRAGGING ABOUT

01:34:58.225 --> 01:34:59.326
THIS ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AS

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:01.262
IF IT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:03.330
OF. THIS IS THE SAME GUY WHO

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:04.598
CALLED THE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:06.267
IN GEORGIA AND DEMANDED THEY

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:08.335
FINED HIM 12,000 VOTES SO HE

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:10.538
COULD WIN THE STATE AND STAY IN

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:12.540
THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS

01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:14.575
SOMEONE WHO EARNESTLY TALKS

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:15.109
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:17.278
SERVING A THIRD TERM AS

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:19.713
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.982
AND NOW REALIZING THAT HIS

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:24.185
POLICIES ARE TERRIBLY UNPOPULAR,

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:26.220
AND THAT VOTERS WILL HAVE A

01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:27.254
CHANCE TO EXPRESS THEIR

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:29.256
OPPOSITION NEXT YEAR. HE'S NOW

01:35:29.323 --> 01:35:32.059
TRYING TO RIG THE ELECTION TO

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:33.194
INOCULATE HIMSELF FROM THE WILL

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.496
OF THE VOTERS AND HOLD ON TO

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.031
POWER. NOW, THIS WOULDN'T BE A

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:39.066
PROBLEM IF ANY REPUBLICAN

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:40.468
ELECTED OFFICIALS HAD A SPINE

01:35:40.534 --> 01:35:42.603
LIKE THE GEORGIA ELECTIONS

01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:44.271
OFFICIALS DID IN 2020 TO SAY,

01:35:44.338 --> 01:35:47.041
NO, MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:48.109
UN-AMERICAN. THIS IS

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:49.944
UNDEMOCRATIC, THIS IS WRONG.

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:52.079

BASKING IN THE ORANGE GLOW OF

POLITICIANS IN CALIFORNIA DON'T

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.342
GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT. THEY

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:23.244
DROP TO THEIR KNEES AND THEY DO

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:24.378

WITH AN UNWAVERING WILL TO ACT.

01:37:31.712 --> 01:37:32.980

VERY POWERFUL PERSPECTIVE. WHAT

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:56.337
WE'RE SPENDING TIME ON AT THIS

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:59.139
PARTICULAR MOMENT, TO ME, IS A

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:01.008
BIT DISAPPOINTING. I WILL TELL

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:05.479
YOU THAT RIGHT NOW, WHAT THIS

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:08.215
BODY NEEDS IS TO BUILD TRUST

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:12.653
WITH ITS CONSTITUENCY. POLLS

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.188
HAVE OVERWHELMINGLY INDICATED

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:17.524
THAT THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST,

01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:18.826
AND WHAT WE'RE CONSIDERING ON

01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:22.763
DOING IS FEEDING THAT LACK OF

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:26.166
TRUST. I YOU KNOW, I HAD A VERY

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:27.268
RESPECTED COLLEAGUE THAT I

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:29.770
SPOKE WITH JUST RECENTLY WHO

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:31.905
TOLD ME THAT THIS IS ALL

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:34.141
POLITICAL. YOU CAN DEFINE IT AS

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:37.144
YOU WISH, BUT I CAN TELL YOU,

01:38:37.211 --> 01:38:39.179
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR POSITION IS

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:40.447
ON THIS THING, AND WE'RE GOING

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:42.249
TO BE TALKING A LOT ABOUT IT

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:44.184
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:45.519
OF BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. BUT I'M

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:47.788
TELLING YOU, WHEN IT COMES DOWN

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:50.024
TO IT, DOES THIS ENHANCE TRUST

01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:54.395
WITH OUR PEOPLE? WE ALL ADMIT

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:58.165
THAT GERRYMANDERING IS

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:02.469
CONTROLLED BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:05.105
SOMETHING TO BENEFIT. THAT IS

01:39:05.172 --> 01:39:07.207
NOT WHAT OUR PEOPLE WANT.

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:09.343
THAT'S BEEN VERY CLEARLY STATED

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:12.579
BY THEIR VOTE. SO WHY, NO

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:13.480
MATTER WHAT THE JUSTIFICATION

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:15.282
IS, WHY WOULD WE ENGAGE IN

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:17.985
BEHAVIOR THAT WE KNOW IS

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:19.186
CONSIDERED UNACCEPTABLE BY

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:21.922
THOSE WHO ELECT US? I WOULD ASK

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:23.290
FOR YOU TO PLEASE REFLECT ON

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:25.559
THAT, BECAUSE IT'S VERY

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:29.096
MEANINGFUL, AND I KNOW THAT WE

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:31.198
CAN BE DISTRACTED BY A LOT OF

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:32.299
INFLUENCERS IN THIS INSTITUTION,

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:34.234
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WE ADMIRE

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:36.537
AND RESPECT. BUT WHEN IT COMES

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:38.238
DOWN TO IT, IT'S A MIRROR THAT

01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:40.974
WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO. PLEASE

01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:42.309
THINK ABOUT THAT. PLEASE THINK

01:39:42.376 --> 01:39:44.945
ABOUT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:47.848
BUILDING TRUST WITH OUR

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:50.017
CONSTITUENCY? I THINK YOU KNOW

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:51.452
WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT IS WHEN

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:53.187
WE ENGAGE IN SUPPORTING

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:55.456
GERRYMANDERING, PLEASE RESIST

01:39:55.522 --> 01:39:57.991
IT. AND PLEASE THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:00.127
YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU. THANK

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:01.261
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LACKEY,

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:02.596
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WALLACE, YOU

ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:05.966
SPEAKER. MEMBERS, I RISE TODAY

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:07.101
IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO H.R.

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:09.169
EIGHT, NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

01:40:09.236 --> 01:40:10.771
WHAT IT DOES, BUT BECAUSE OF

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:13.107
WHAT IT REPRESENTS. ACA

01:40:13.173 --> 01:40:14.675
REPRESENTS A TIT FOR TAT

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:16.043
STRATEGY. IT'S A REACTIVE MOVE

01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:18.278
THAT ERODES OUR CREDIBILITY,

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:20.614
NOT JUST HERE AT HOME, BUT ON

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:21.215
THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:23.517
STAGE. IF WE ABANDON THE

01:40:23.584 --> 01:40:24.051
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:25.619
PROCESS THAT CALIFORNIANS

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:27.187
CREATED, WE DON'T JUST LOSE A

01:40:27.254 --> 01:40:28.989
TOOL, WE LOSE TRUST. OUR

01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:30.224
CITIZENS. REDISTRICTING

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:32.259
COMMISSION WAS BORN FROM VOTER

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:33.994
DEMAND FOR FAIRNESS AND

01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:35.362
TRANSPARENCY. WHILE DRAWING OUR

01:40:35.429 --> 01:40:36.797
CURRENT MAPS, THE COMMISSION

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.031
HELD HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:39.800
MEETINGS, REVIEWED TENS OF

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:41.268
THOUSANDS OF COMMENTS, AND DREW

01:40:41.335 --> 01:40:42.536
MAPS THAT REFLECT PEOPLE AND

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:44.037
COMMUNITIES, NOT POLITICIANS

01:40:44.104 --> 01:40:45.305
AND THEIR PREFERENCES. THAT'S

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:47.040
NOT JUST GOOD GOVERNANCE. IT'S

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:49.243
A MODEL FOR THE NATION. SOME

01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:50.244
POINT TO TEXAS IS A

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:52.479
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS PROPOSAL,

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:54.515
BUT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T FOLLOW.

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.049
WE LEAD. WE DON'T. MERE

01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:57.584
DYSFUNCTION. WE SET THE

01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:59.086
STANDARD. FORMER GOVERNOR

01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:01.021
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER CALLED

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:01.989
GERRYMANDERING THE CANCER OF

01:41:02.055 --> 01:41:04.224
POLITICS. HE CHAMPIONED THE

01:41:04.291 --> 01:41:06.160
COMMISSION BECAUSE HE BELIEVED

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:07.761
IN A SYSTEM THAT PUTS VOTERS

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:09.897
FIRST. THAT BELIEF STILL

01:41:09.963 --> 01:41:12.599
MATTERS. I URGE A NO VOTE.

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:14.401
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:16.470
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOWENTHAL,

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:18.572
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED FROM THE

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:21.942
MAJORITY LEADER'S DESK. THANK

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:27.214
YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. I LOVE YOU,

01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:31.919
DAD. I'VE BEEN DEEPLY TORN BY

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:32.453
THE NATIONAL REDISTRICTING

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:33.587
DEBATE THAT HAS ENGULFED

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:37.257
CALIFORNIA BEYOND ITS VASTLY

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:38.559
CONSEQUENTIAL POLITICAL

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:40.694
IMPLICATIONS. THIS ISSUE HAS

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:41.161
PROFOUNDLY IMPACTED ME

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:44.832
PERSONALLY BECAUSE INDELIBLY

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:47.134
SEARED IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS IS

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:49.503
THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER WORKING

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:51.038
TIRELESSLY OVER DECADES TO

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:53.674
CREATE THE INDEPENDENT

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:54.208
REDISTRICTING SYSTEM ABOUT

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:57.177
WHICH WE NOW DEBATE. BY WAY OF

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.513
BACKGROUND, MY DAD, A COMMUNITY

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.314
PSYCHOLOGIST, WAS ELECTED TO

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.916
THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY

01:42:02.983 --> 01:42:04.151
IN 1998. HE RAN FOR PUBLIC

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:06.086
OFFICE WITH THE PRINCIPAL GOALS

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:08.555
OF RESTORING PUBLIC TRUST IN

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:09.623
POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:11.325
ENSURING THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:14.094
LISTEN TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:16.263
EFFECTUATE THOSE IDEALS. HE

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:17.798
BELIEVED THAT THE INDEPENDENT

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:19.500
REDISTRICTING SYSTEM WAS

01:42:19.566 --> 01:42:21.368
NECESSARY. SO IN 2002, ON THIS

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:24.037
VERY FLOOR, HE INTRODUCED A

01:42:24.104 --> 01:42:26.673
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, AC 19,

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.475
TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:31.011
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION, BUT

01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:33.247
HIS ATTEMPT RECEIVED NO SUPPORT,

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:36.383
AND IT DIED. UNDETERRED, HE

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:38.151
REINTRODUCED THE INDEPENDENT

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:39.286
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:40.087
CONCEPT ONCE AGAIN IN THE

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:42.155
ASSEMBLY, BUT THAT EFFORT TOO

01:42:42.222 --> 01:42:45.058
FAILED, AND THEN IN 2006, AS A

01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:46.727
STATE SENATOR, HE REINTRODUCED

01:42:46.793 --> 01:42:49.229
THE CONCEPT AS SCA3, AND FOR

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:51.231
THE FIRST TIME EVER, THE

01:42:51.298 --> 01:42:52.833
CONCEPT OF INDEPENDENT

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.001
REDISTRICTING PASSED ONE OF OUR

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:57.671
BICAMERAL BODIES. HOWEVER, AS

01:42:57.738 --> 01:42:59.039
DESCRIBED BY COMMON CAUSE QUOTE,

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:00.340
SOMEWHERE IN THE ONE MINUTE

01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:01.975
WALK FROM THE SENATE CLERK'S

01:43:02.042 --> 01:43:03.844
OFFICE TO THE ASSEMBLY CLERK'S

01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:05.312
OFFICE, SCA3 WAS LOST FOR JUST

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:08.081
LONG ENOUGH TO MISS KEY

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:09.583
DEADLINES TO KEEP THE BILL

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:12.085
ALIVE. THE FAILURE WAS

01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:13.287
DEVASTATING, BUT MY DAD'S

01:43:13.353 --> 01:43:14.955
UNWAVERING EFFORT PAVED THE WAY

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:17.090
FOR THE ELECTORATE TO ADOPT AN

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:18.325
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:19.493
COMMISSION TWO YEARS LATER, BUT

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.261
HIS WORK DID NOT END THERE.

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:23.397
UPON GOING TO CONGRESS IN 2012,

01:43:23.463 --> 01:43:24.998
THE FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:27.301
HE INTRODUCED WAS H.R. 2978,

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:29.002
THE LET THE PEOPLE DRAW THE

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:31.438
LINES ACT. THIS LEGISLATION

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:33.607
WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THAT ALL

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:35.742
STATES ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:37.244
REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS.

01:43:37.311 --> 01:43:38.178
TRAGICALLY, THE LEGISLATION WAS

01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:40.180
MET BY POLITICAL HEADWINDS AND

01:43:40.247 --> 01:43:42.049
DIED. BUT DESPITE THAT, MY DAD

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:44.318
PRESSED FORWARD ON HIS QUIXOTIC

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:45.919
REQUEST TO ESTABLISH REFORM ON

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:48.021
A NATIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE HE

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:49.556
KNEW THAT A SYSTEM IN WHICH

01:43:49.623 --> 01:43:51.191
SOME STATES HAD DISTRICTS DRAWN

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:54.528
INDEPENDENTLY AND OTHERS DON'T

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:55.896
WAS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:58.398
BECAUSE CONGRESS REFUSED TO

01:43:58.465 --> 01:44:00.667
HOLD A VOTE ON HIS MEASURES, HE

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:02.035
COMMENCED ADVOCATING FOR REFORM

01:44:02.102 --> 01:44:04.271
IN THE COURTS. IN 2015, HE LED

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:06.373
AN AMICUS BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.140
ARIZONA'S RIGHT TO FORM AN

01:44:07.207 --> 01:44:09.142
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION, AND

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:11.144
THEN IN 2017, HE LED AN AMICUS

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:13.280
BRIEF IN GILL V WHITFORD, WHICH

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:14.481
HE ASKED THE SUPREME COURT TO

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:15.248
DECLARE POLITICAL

01:44:15.315 --> 01:44:17.517
GERRYMANDERING TO BE

01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:18.352
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. ALTHOUGH THE

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:20.220
COURT DID NOT DO SO. JUSTICE

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:22.222
KAGAN, IN AN OPINION BY

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:24.358
JUSTICES GINSBURG, BREYER, AND

01:44:24.424 --> 01:44:26.593
SOTOMAYOR, CITED MY DAD'S BRIEF

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.260
WRITING. THE CONGRESSIONAL

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:30.497
BRIEF DESCRIBES A CASCADE OF

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:31.965
NEGATIVE RESULTS FROM EXCESSIVE

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:33.166
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERING,

01:44:33.233 --> 01:44:35.202
INDIFFERENCE TO SWING VOTERS

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:37.070
AND THEIR VIEWS, EXTREME

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:39.172
POLITICAL POSITIONING

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:40.273
DESIGNATED TO PLACATE THE

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.309
PARTY'S BASE AND FEND OFF

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:44.811
PRIMARY CHALLENGERS, THE

01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:46.313
DEVALUING OF NEGOTIATION AND

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.081
COMPROMISE, AND THE

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:49.650
IMPOSSIBILITY OF REACHING

01:44:49.716 --> 01:44:51.051
PRAGMATIC, BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:54.254
OF THE NATION'S PROBLEMS. I

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.123
VIGOROUSLY AGREE WITH THE EVILS

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:57.391
OF GERRYMANDERING DESCRIBED IN

01:44:57.457 --> 01:44:58.992
MY DAD'S BRIEF AND CITED BY

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:00.427
JUSTICE KAGAN THAT

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:02.262
NOTWITHSTANDING, BECAUSE TEXAS

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:06.099
HAS NOW SHAMELESSLY AFFECTED

01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:08.101
THE NATIONAL BALANCE OF POWER,

01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:11.104
OUR NATION'S DEMOCRACY IS FACED

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:13.640
WITH THE EXIGENCY OF

01:45:13.707 --> 01:45:16.810
EXISTENTIAL DIMENSIONS. IF

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:19.479
UNADDRESSED TEXAS ACTIONS WHICH

01:45:19.546 --> 01:45:21.348
OCCURRED WITHOUT THE VOTE OF

01:45:21.415 --> 01:45:22.049
ITS POPULACE, WILL

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:24.217
DISENFRANCHIZE CALIFORNIANS.

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:25.952
AND WE MUST NOT ALLOW

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:27.587
CALIFORNIANS VOICES TO BE

01:45:27.654 --> 01:45:30.057
SILENCED. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:31.958
CALIFORNIANS HAVE A VOICE IN

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:33.260
SELECTING THE POLITICAL PARTY

01:45:33.326 --> 01:45:37.097
THAT CONTROLS CONGRESS IN 2026,

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:39.566
THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IN

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:41.134
OUR DEMOCRACY, UPON WHICH THE

01:45:41.201 --> 01:45:42.703
COLLECTIVE VALUE SYSTEM IS

01:45:42.769 --> 01:45:45.372
PREDICATED IS FAIRNESS. WHEN

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:47.340
CALIFORNIANS VOTE IN 2026, OUR

01:45:47.407 --> 01:45:50.077
VOTES MUST BE MADE ON A LEVEL

01:45:50.143 --> 01:45:51.144
PLAYING FIELD. THIS

01:45:51.211 --> 01:45:51.978
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT

01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:54.381
ENSURES THAT WE HAVE THAT

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:56.183
BALANCED FIELD. WE MUST ALL

01:45:56.249 --> 01:45:57.484
CONTINUE TO PRESS CONGRESS TO

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:59.653
CREATE A NATIONAL SYSTEM THAT

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.855
ELIMINATES UNCONSTRAINED

01:46:01.922 --> 01:46:03.123
POLITICAL REDISTRICTING. BUT

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:05.158
UNTIL THAT OCCURS, FAIR

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:06.827
REPRESENTATION FOR CALIFORNIANS

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.361
CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THIS

01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:10.764
MEASURE. SO TODAY, I PROUDLY

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:13.200
JOIN WITH MY FATHER, THE

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:15.168
ARCHITECT OF THIS COMMISSION,

01:46:15.235 --> 01:46:17.104
IN URGING ITS TEMPORARY

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:18.472
SUSPENSION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:22.776
FOR YOUR VOTE ON ACR. THANK YOU.

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:23.310
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:24.344
MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA YOU ARE

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:28.081
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:31.184
SPEAKER AND MEMBERS, I ALSO

01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:34.054
STAND IN SUPPORT OF ACA EIGHT

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:35.422
COLLEAGUES. WE ARE LIVING

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:37.357
THROUGH A DRAMATIC AND HISTORIC

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:40.060
MOMENT, A MOMENT TO STAND UP

01:46:40.127 --> 01:46:41.928
FOR OUR DEMOCRACY, ONE THAT

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:44.364
WILL SHAPE OUR FUTURE FOR

01:46:44.431 --> 01:46:46.299
GENERATIONS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:47.501
WE HAVE WITNESSED EFFORTS TO

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:50.504
MANIPULATE DISTRICT LINES NOT

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:51.404
TO REPRESENT PEOPLE, BUT TO

01:46:51.471 --> 01:46:54.107
CLING TO POWER, TO SILENCE

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:56.676
COMMUNITIES, AND TO STEAL

01:46:56.743 --> 01:46:59.279
REPRESENTATION. WE SAW THIS IN

01:46:59.346 --> 01:47:00.280
GEORGIA, WHERE THREE

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:02.115
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS WERE TAKEN

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:04.417
MID-TERM THROUGH REDISTRICTING.

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:07.320
WE SEE IT AGAIN IN TEXAS, WHERE

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:09.456
FIVE SEATS WERE CARVED OUT AT

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:11.591
THE REQUEST OF PRESIDENT TRUMP,

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:15.362
ALL WITHOUT GIVING VOTERS A A

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:18.298
VOICE. BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA,

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:21.568
WE HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT PATH

01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:26.773
NOT TO STEAL, NOT TO RIG, NOT SILENCE. WE

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:27.340
TO HAVE CHOSEN TO

01:47:27.407 --> 01:47:31.344
LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE TO LET

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.079
THEM VOTE ON THE CALIFORNIA

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:36.917
MAPS. THE CALIFORNIA

01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:38.118
REDISTRICTING, REDISTRICTING,

01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:40.620
REDISTRICTING PLAN IS ABOUT

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:42.455
FAIRNESS. IT'S ABOUT TRUST. SO

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:46.026
WHEN CRITICS CRY, POWER GRAB,

01:47:46.092 --> 01:47:49.262
LET US BE CLEAR THE PLAN IS NOT

01:47:49.329 --> 01:47:51.398
A POWER GRAB. IT IS A POWER

01:47:51.464 --> 01:47:54.034
RETURN, RETURNING POWER BACK TO

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:58.205
THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. WE

01:47:58.271 --> 01:48:00.473
DID NOT START THIS FIGHT. WE

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:02.175
DID NOT FORCE THIS ISSUE. IT

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:03.844
WAS FORCED UPON US BY A

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:06.112
PRESIDENT WHO HAS THREATENED,

01:48:06.179 --> 01:48:08.448
CHEATED AND TRIED TO STEAL

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:11.751
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS TO CLING TO

01:48:11.818 --> 01:48:15.088
POWER. DO NOT WASTE YOUR BREATH

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:16.489
SCOLDING THOSE OF US WHO REFUSE

01:48:16.556 --> 01:48:18.592
TO ROLL OVER FOR PARTIZAN MAPS

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:21.995
THAT DIVIDE OUR COMMUNITIES. A

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:25.265
BULLY AND YES, OUR PRESIDENT

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:28.034
ACTS AS ONE, USES POWER TO

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:29.936
INTIMIDATE, TO HARM AND TO

01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:33.573
CHEAT. HE HAS SHOWN A POWER, A

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.475
PATTERN OF REFUSING TO ACCEPT

01:48:35.542 --> 01:48:38.144
THE RESULTS OF FREE AND FAIR

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:41.281
ELECTIONS. IN 2020, HE FALSELY

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:43.250
CLAIMED VICTORY. WHEN HE DOES

01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:45.385
NOT GET WHAT HE WANTS, HE

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:48.455
SHOUTS, HE INSULTS AND LASHES

01:48:48.521 --> 01:48:51.491
OUT LIKE A SPOILED CHILD. IF

01:48:51.558 --> 01:48:54.561
YOU CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT JUSTICE

01:48:54.628 --> 01:48:56.963
AND FAIRNESS, THEN ANSWER THIS

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.666
WHERE IS YOUR OUTRAGE WHEN

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:02.302
STATES SILENCE VOTERS BY

01:49:02.369 --> 01:49:04.137
CARVING UP DISTRICTS FOR

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:06.339
PARTIZAN GAIN? WHERE IS YOUR

01:49:06.406 --> 01:49:08.541
OUTRAGE WHEN WORKING FAMILIES,

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:10.310
SENIORS, VETERANS, AND

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:12.078
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES ARE

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.481
PUSHED TO THE SIDELINES AS THEY

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:16.883
WILL BE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:18.852
NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER JUST THIS

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.387
WEEK TO PROHIBIT MAIL IN

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:26.092
BALLOTS? MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

01:49:26.159 --> 01:49:28.695
DIEGO SAYS ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:31.197
THAN WORDS ON THIS POINT. WE

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:33.867
AGREE CALIFORNIA'S ACTION IS

01:49:33.934 --> 01:49:35.302
CLEAR. WE ARE SHOWING THE

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:37.337
NATION HOW TO RISE ABOVE

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:40.073
PARTIZAN BICKERING AND TO STAND

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.742
FOR DEMOCRACY. WE ARE SHOWING

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:44.144
THAT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE

01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:45.312
POLITICIANS, SHOULD CHOOSE

01:49:45.378 --> 01:49:48.315
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. WE WILL

01:49:48.381 --> 01:49:50.317
NOT STAND IDLY BY AS A BULLY

01:49:50.383 --> 01:49:53.153
SCREAMS AND THREATENS. WE WILL

01:49:53.219 --> 01:49:55.622
FIGHT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY TO

01:49:55.689 --> 01:49:59.159
PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY. WHY?

01:49:59.225 --> 01:50:01.761
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT OUR NATION

01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:03.496
WAS FOUNDED ON. HISTORY WILL

01:50:03.563 --> 01:50:05.098
REMEMBER THAT WHEN DEMOCRACY

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:08.201
WAS TESTED, CALIFORNIA CHOSE

01:50:08.268 --> 01:50:10.437
FAIRNESS, TRANSPARENCY AND THE

01:50:10.503 --> 01:50:13.340
PEOPLE'S VOICE. YOU CAN WHINE

01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:16.443
AND COMPLAIN OR YOU CAN STAND

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:18.144
WITH DEMOCRACY, BUT YOU CANNOT

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:21.548
DO BOTH. AS PRESIDENT LINCOLN

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:23.583
REMINDED US, ELECTIONS BELONG

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:26.219
TO THE PEOPLE. IT'S THEIR

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:29.422
DECISION. AS JUSTICE RUTH BADER

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:31.691
GINSBURG SAID, REAL CHANGE,

01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:34.127
ENDURING CHANGE HAPPENS ONE

01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:37.330
STEP AT A TIME. AND AS DOCTOR

01:50:37.397 --> 01:50:39.199
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR TAUGHT US,

01:50:39.265 --> 01:50:42.035
THE TIME IS ALWAYS RIGHT TO DO

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:44.170
WHAT IS RIGHT. TODAY,

01:50:44.237 --> 01:50:46.039
CALIFORNIA IS DRAWING A LINE IN

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:48.775
THE SAND. WE ARE STANDING

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:51.044
BOLDLY WITH THE PEOPLE AND

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:54.147
TODAY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT

THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

IN OPPOSITION TO ACA. A. ACA, A

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:16.302
SEEK TO DESTROY DEMOCRACY AND

01:51:16.369 --> 01:51:18.972
VIOLATING CALIFORNIA

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:22.809
CONSTITUTION. I THINK YOU ALL

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:28.248
HEARD ABOUT MY PERSONAL STORY.

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:31.217
I LEFT A COUNTRY IN 1982 AT THE

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:37.457
AGE OF 19. AND I CAME HERE WITH

01:51:37.524 --> 01:51:42.829
MY FAMILY FOR FREEDOM. AND

01:51:42.896 --> 01:51:46.232
UNTIL TODAY, THE COUNTRY THAT I

01:51:46.299 --> 01:51:51.604
LEFT. MORE THAN 30 YEARS AGO

01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:59.245
DOESN'T HAVE ANY FAIR ELECTION.

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:03.616
THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN RULED BY

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:12.192
ONE PARTY, AND THAT PARTY. THEY

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:15.628
MAKE THEIR OWN LAWS AND THEY'VE

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:20.800
BEEN VIOLATED ALL LAWS OVER

01:52:20.867 --> 01:52:25.338
TIME. AND IT TOOK ME AND MY

FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND

01:53:06.946 --> 01:53:13.186
OTHER STATE. HOWEVER, WHAT DID

01:53:13.253 --> 01:53:17.157

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:18.925
HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION,

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:21.060
DIFFERENT IDEAS, BUT AT THE END

01:53:21.127 --> 01:53:26.299

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:35.041

DICTATORSHIP. YOU KNOW, MY DAD

01:56:37.357 --> 01:56:40.193
FOUGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY IN THE

01:56:40.259 --> 01:56:42.962
KOREAN WAR. HE FOUGHT AND HAD

01:56:43.029 --> 01:56:45.198
RHEUMATIC FEVER AND AND SPENT

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:48.368
HIS LIFE WITH HEALTH CARE

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:50.269
ISSUES BECAUSE OF THAT, AND

01:56:50.336 --> 01:56:52.372
DIED AN EARLY DEATH. HE

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:55.141
ENLISTED IN THE AIR FORCE

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:57.276
BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE FOR OUR

01:56:57.343 --> 01:57:00.113
COUNTRY AND HIS LOVE FOR OUR

01:57:00.179 --> 01:57:02.115
DEMOCRACY, HE WOULD BE TURNING

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:05.785
IN HIS GRAVE IF HE UNDERSTOOD

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:07.653
WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS DOING.

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.423
TODAY, WHEN I LOOK INTO MY KIDS

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:13.326
EYES AND HOPEFULLY MY GRANDKIDS

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:16.662
EYES IN THE FUTURE, I DON'T

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:18.264
WANT TO REGRET THAT WE DIDN'T

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:21.033
FIGHT HARD ENOUGH FOR THEM. I

01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:25.071
WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT TODAY

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:27.240

WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT WE

01:57:39.185 --> 01:57:41.154
FOUGHT FOR THEM. WE FOUGHT FOR

01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:43.322
THEIR FUTURE. WE DID EVERYTHING

01:57:43.389 --> 01:57:46.225
IN OUR POWER TO ASSURE THAT

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:49.195
THEY COULD LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY,

01:57:49.262 --> 01:57:51.097
IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE HAVE

01:57:51.164 --> 01:57:54.534
LIVED IN A DEMOCRACY FOR OVER

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.002
250 YEARS, THAT WE FOUGHT FOR

01:57:56.068 --> 01:57:58.471

OF OUR DEMOCRACY THAT WE HAVE,

01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:11.250
WE HAVE HAD. SO ON BEHALF OF MY

01:58:11.317 --> 01:58:15.054

01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:41.013
FIGHT. AND THAT CULMINATED IN

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:43.115
THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE THAT

01:58:43.182 --> 01:58:44.550

ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY THAT WE

01:58:50.223 --> 01:58:52.225
SHOULD STICK WITH THAT. AND I

01:58:52.291 --> 01:58:53.993
WANT TO START BY SAYING WHAT

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:55.628
THIS IS NOT ABOUT. IT IS NOT

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:57.430
ABOUT TEXAS. AND ACTUALLY, YOU

01:58:57.497 --> 01:59:00.132
ALL JUST CONCEDED THAT BY YOUR

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:01.300

AMENDED ACR EIGHT TO TAKE OUT

01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:06.172
TEXAS AS A CONDITION, AND THAT

01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:07.073
THIS BILL THAT YOU ARE VOTING

01:59:07.139 --> 01:59:09.809
ON RIGHT NOW DOESN'T HAVE TEXAS

01:59:09.876 --> 01:59:11.944
AS A CONDITION AND COMMITS

01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:14.413
CALIFORNIA TO GOING BACK TO

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:15.281
GERRYMANDERING. AND YOU SHOULD

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:17.517
REALLY THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:20.286
GO AHEAD AND DO THAT TODAY.

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:23.222
IT'S ABOUT POWER. WE KNOW THAT

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:26.359
IT'S ABOUT POWER ON BOTH SIDES,

01:59:26.425 --> 01:59:27.293
RIGGING CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.962
TO GET PARTIZAN RESULTS. THAT'S

01:59:30.029 --> 01:59:33.199
WHAT A GERRYMANDER IS. NOW, THE

01:59:33.266 --> 01:59:34.467
GOVERNOR SAYS IT'S ABOUT

01:59:34.534 --> 01:59:36.168
FIGHTING WITH FIGHTING FIRE

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:39.071
WITH FIRE. AND WHAT I WANT TO

01:59:39.138 --> 01:59:41.307
SUBMIT TO YOU ALL TODAY IS THAT

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:45.077
FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE IS THE

01:59:45.144 --> 01:59:49.048
PROBLEM. IT'S NOT THE SOLUTION.

01:59:49.115 --> 01:59:50.650
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FIGHTING

01:59:50.716 --> 01:59:53.185
FIRE WITH FIRE. HE SAW HOW

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:55.888
GOVERNMENT WAS WEAPONIZED

01:59:55.955 --> 01:59:56.923
AGAINST HIM WITH THE DEMOCRATIC

01:59:56.989 --> 02:00:00.293
MAJORITY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IN

02:00:00.359 --> 02:00:02.061
HIS FIRST TERM, HE SAW HOW

02:00:02.128 --> 02:00:04.530
STATES LIKE ILLINOIS AND

02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:06.132
MASSACHUSETTS, HAWAII HAVE

02:00:06.198 --> 02:00:08.501
SEVERELY GERRYMANDERED THEIR

02:00:08.568 --> 02:00:09.368
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS IN WAYS

02:00:09.435 --> 02:00:12.471
THAT ENSURE MORE DEMOCRATIC

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:15.007
MEMBERS ARE ELECTED. AND HE

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:18.477
SEEKS TO DO THE SAME THING IN

02:00:18.544 --> 02:00:22.882
TEXAS. HE IS WRONG TO DO SO.

02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:26.752
LET ME REPEAT AGAIN. HE IS

02:00:26.819 --> 02:00:30.957
WRONG TO DO SO. GAVIN IS

02:00:31.023 --> 02:00:34.093
FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE. SO NOW

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:37.196
HE'S PUSHING THIS REDISTRICTING

02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:40.900
PLAN, THIS GAVIN MANDER.

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:43.135
ILLEGALLY AGAINST THE

02:00:43.202 --> 02:00:45.171
CONSTITUTION, AS WE POINTED OUT

02:00:45.237 --> 02:00:46.172
TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN THE

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:47.840
COMMITTEE HEARING. WELL, THE

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:49.275
ONE COMMITTEE HEARING WE HAD ON

02:00:49.342 --> 02:00:52.545
POLICY GROUNDS, HE'S VIOLATING

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:54.313
THE CONSTITUTION AND THE CLEAR

02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:55.448
WILL OF THE VOTERS WHO'VE

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:58.217
ALREADY SPOKEN TWICE. WE REALLY

02:00:58.284 --> 02:00:59.452
DON'T NEED TO ASK HIM A THIRD

02:00:59.518 --> 02:01:02.688
TIME, GUYS. TWICE. THEY TOLD US

02:01:02.755 --> 02:01:03.456
THEY WANT INDEPENDENT

02:01:03.522 --> 02:01:04.991
REDISTRICTING, FAIR

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:09.095
REPRESENTATION. BUT WHERE DOES

02:01:09.161 --> 02:01:11.831
IT END? YOU MOVE FORWARD TODAY

02:01:11.897 --> 02:01:13.499
AND YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO.

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:16.469
YOU CAN DO THAT AND GAVIN CAN

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:17.803
MOVE FORWARD. HE'S A GOVERNOR.

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:20.706
HE HAS THE POWER. GREG ABBOTT

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:24.143
HAS THE POWER. AND TEXAS. YOU

02:01:24.210 --> 02:01:25.311
MOVE FORWARD FIGHTING FIRE WITH

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:28.047
FIRE. WHAT HAPPENS? YOU BURN IT

02:01:28.114 --> 02:01:33.152
ALL DOWN. AND IN THIS CASE, IT

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:34.420
AFFECTS OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:36.355
AMERICAN PRINCIPLE

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:38.290
REPRESENTATION. WASN'T THAT THE

02:01:38.357 --> 02:01:40.126
BATTLE CRY OF OUR FOUNDING

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:43.095
FOREBEARS? NO TAXATION WITHOUT

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:45.998
REPRESENTATION, BUT THE

02:01:46.065 --> 02:01:47.133
PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO

02:01:47.199 --> 02:01:48.567
REPRESENTATION IS EXACTLY WHAT

02:01:48.634 --> 02:01:51.737
WILL BE SACRIFICED WHEN WE

02:01:51.804 --> 02:01:52.905
CONTINUE DOWN THIS ROAD. WHEN

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:56.542
AFTER YOU DO IT. MISSOURI DOES

02:01:56.609 --> 02:01:58.411
IT OR INDIANA DOES IT? COLORADO

02:01:58.477 --> 02:02:01.647
IS TALKING ABOUT DOING IT. AT

02:02:01.714 --> 02:02:04.216
THE END OF THAT, THE PARTIES

02:02:04.283 --> 02:02:07.319
WILL DETERMINE WHO REPRESENTS,

02:02:07.386 --> 02:02:09.588
AND THE PEOPLE WILL BE

02:02:09.655 --> 02:02:12.158
POWERLESS TO TO ELECT THEIR OWN

02:02:12.224 --> 02:02:13.526
REPRESENTATIVES. AND WE'VE

02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:15.394
ALREADY SEEN EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE

02:02:15.461 --> 02:02:17.029
OF THAT IN SOME OF HOW SOME OF

02:02:17.096 --> 02:02:19.665
THESE DISTRICTS ARE PROPOSED TO

02:02:19.732 --> 02:02:23.436
BE DRAWN. THERE'S REALLY ONLY

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:26.739
ONE WAY TO STOP IT. SOMEONE HAS

02:02:26.806 --> 02:02:29.975
TO REFRAIN FROM STRIKING BACK

02:02:30.042 --> 02:02:32.278
AND SHOW A BETTER WAY. AND WITH

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:33.979
THAT, I WOULD LIKE PERMISSION

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:36.382
TO READ SOME VERY WISE WORDS

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:38.784
THAT I WILL BE WITHOUT

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:42.254
OBJECTION, WITHOUT OBJECTION.

02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:44.156
YOU HAVE HEARD IT SAID, AN EYE

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:46.525
FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A

02:02:46.592 --> 02:02:49.195
TOOTH. BUT I SAY TO YOU, DO NOT

02:02:49.261 --> 02:02:52.264
RESIST THE ONE WHO IS EVIL. BUT

02:02:52.331 --> 02:02:53.165
IF ANYONE SLAPS YOU ON THE

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:55.234
RIGHT CHEEK, TURN TO HIM THE

02:02:55.301 --> 02:02:58.003
OTHER ALSO. 30S YOU HAVE HEARD

02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:59.338
THAT IT WAS SAID, YOU SHALL

02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:00.539
LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AND HATE

02:03:00.606 --> 02:03:02.174
YOUR ENEMY. BUT I SAY TO YOU,

02:03:02.241 --> 02:03:04.276
LOVE YOUR ENEMIES AND PRAY FOR

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:05.044
THOSE WHO PERSECUTE YOU, SO

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:07.046
THAT YOU MAY BE THE SONS OF

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:08.347
YOUR FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN.

02:03:08.414 --> 02:03:10.416
FOR HE MAKES THE SUN RISE ON

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:11.317
THE EVIL AND THE GOOD, AND

02:03:11.383 --> 02:03:13.285
SENDS RAIN ON THE JUST AND THE

02:03:13.352 --> 02:03:15.287
UNJUST. YOU THEREFORE MUST BE

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:16.355
PERFECT, AS YOUR HEAVENLY

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:18.624
FATHER IS PERFECT. TODAY I'M

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:20.192
SUBMITTING TO YOU. LET US TURN

02:03:20.259 --> 02:03:22.194
THE OTHER CHEEK. LET US SHOW

02:03:22.261 --> 02:03:23.462
THE BETTER WAY. WHAT MORE

02:03:23.529 --> 02:03:25.097
POWERFUL STATEMENT WILL WE HAVE

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:26.799
IF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS

02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:29.135
TOGETHER SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH?

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:31.337
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS. AND

02:03:31.403 --> 02:03:32.071
TEXAS, YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT

02:03:32.138 --> 02:03:33.472
EITHER. THANK YOU. LEADER

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:35.875
GALLAGHER, ONE LAST POINT. I'M

02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:40.112
SORRY. OUR DEMOCRACY WILL

02:03:40.179 --> 02:03:41.514
PERSIST AS LONG AS WE FIGHT

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:44.116
BACK. AND IF THERE IS ONE

02:03:44.183 --> 02:03:45.651
WEAKNESS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:47.486
IN OUR REPUBLIC IS THAT

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:49.722
LEGISLATORS ARE NOT STANDING UP

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:52.191
TO EXECUTIVES OF THEIR OWN

02:03:52.258 --> 02:03:53.826
PARTY. THANK YOU. LEADER

02:03:53.893 --> 02:03:55.528
GALLAGHER. AND THAT'S WHAT WE

02:03:55.594 --> 02:03:56.562
NEED TO DO TODAY. GALLAGHER.

02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:58.697
THANK YOU. LEADER GALLAGHER,

02:03:58.764 --> 02:04:00.366
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARRILLO, YOU

02:04:00.432 --> 02:04:08.307
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:11.210
SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I RISE IN

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:14.046
SUPPORT OF H.R. EIGHT. THIS IS

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:16.949
A ROUGH POSITION THAT OUR

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:18.150
COUNTRY AND OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:21.287
THESE DAYS. LEADERS IN D.C. AND

02:04:21.353 --> 02:04:22.121
ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE TIME

02:04:22.188 --> 02:04:24.757
AND TIME AGAIN PROVEN THAT THEY

02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:26.058
ARE WILLING TO BEND, STRETCH

02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:27.193
AND OUTRIGHT BREAK THE LAW IF

02:04:27.259 --> 02:04:29.562
IT MEANS THEY ARE GAINING MORE

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:31.297
POWER. THEY ARE UNASHAMEDLY

02:04:31.363 --> 02:04:33.132
TRYING TO CHANGE THE RULES IN

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.034
THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME,

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:37.169
UNDERMINE OUR INSTITUTIONS, AND

02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:39.238
JUST FLAT CHEAT BECAUSE THEY

02:04:39.305 --> 02:04:41.273
KNOW THAT IS WHAT IT WILL TAKE

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:43.342
FOR THEM TO HAVE A CHANCE TO

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:46.712
WIN. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS

02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:47.246
MEASURE, TO GIVE OUR

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:48.347
CONSTITUENTS AND OUR STATE A

02:04:48.414 --> 02:04:51.417
CHANCE TO FIGHT WITH EVEN ODDS.

02:04:51.483 --> 02:04:53.352
IF AT HALF TIME, ONE TEAM

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:54.253
DECIDES THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.322
THE SECOND HALF WITH 15 PLAYERS

02:04:56.388 --> 02:04:59.058
INSTEAD OF 11. WE CAN DISAGREE

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:01.560
AND CRY FOUL ALL WE WANT, BUT

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:03.295
IF WE PLAY THE SECOND HALF BY

02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:05.831
THE SAME OLD RULES WITH 11

02:05:05.898 --> 02:05:08.267
PLAYERS, WE PUT OUR TEAM AND

02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:09.168
THE PEOPLE WE'RE PLAYING FOR AT

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:13.405
A HUGE DISADVANTAGE. AND FOR

02:05:13.472 --> 02:05:17.676
WHAT? PRIDE PRINCIPLE NØ

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:19.345
MEMBERS. THERE IS FAR TOO MUCH

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:22.681
AT STAKE. THEY HAVE MADE THAT

02:05:22.748 --> 02:05:24.283
PAINFULLY CLEAR. OBVIOUSLY, ALL

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:26.185
OF US ON THIS FLOOR WOULD

02:05:26.252 --> 02:05:28.387
RATHER NOT BE SPENDING OUR TIME

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:29.955
ON THIS ISSUE. THERE IS

02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:31.123
CERTAINLY NO SHORTAGE OF

02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:32.258
PRESSING ISSUES OUR

02:05:32.324 --> 02:05:34.326
CONSTITUENTS NEED US TO ADDRESS,

02:05:34.393 --> 02:05:37.529
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY IS

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:38.998
THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS

02:05:39.064 --> 02:05:41.267
MANUFACTURED THIS ISSUE. AND I

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:43.068
WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE IS NO

02:05:43.135 --> 02:05:44.870
ISSUE MORE PRESSING THAN

02:05:44.937 --> 02:05:46.272
ENSURING CALIFORNIANS GET THE

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:48.073
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY BY THE SAME

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:50.876
RULES AS THE REST OF THE

02:05:50.943 --> 02:05:52.211
COUNTRY, EVEN IF WE DON'T LIKE

02:05:52.278 --> 02:05:55.314
WHAT THOSE RULES ARE. MEMBERS,

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:58.517
I URGE YOU, I VOTE ON ACA.

02:05:58.584 --> 02:06:00.019
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:01.153
MEMBER. CARRILLO. ASSEMBLY

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.188
MEMBER MARK GONZALEZ, YOU ARE

02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:04.857
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:05.991
SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I RISE

02:06:06.058 --> 02:06:08.093
TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.962
EIGHT, THE MAP THAT LEADS TO

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:12.631
YOU. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:14.300
ABOUT REDISTRICTING, IT'S ABOUT

02:06:14.366 --> 02:06:17.269
THE SURVIVAL OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

02:06:17.336 --> 02:06:19.538
I WAS BORN IN MCALLEN, TEXAS,

02:06:19.605 --> 02:06:21.106
WHERE VOTER SUPPRESSION WAS, IN

02:06:21.173 --> 02:06:24.777
THEORY, IT WAS REALITY. I SAW

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:25.611
NEIGHBORS TURNED AWAY AT THE

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.780
POLLS. I SAW FAMILIES SILENCED.

02:06:27.846 --> 02:06:29.114
I SAW ENTIRE COMMUNITIES ERASED

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:32.117
FROM THE MAP. AS A LATINO, I

02:06:32.184 --> 02:06:33.652
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:35.154
WHEN POLITICIANS DRAW RACIST

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:37.823
MAPS TO HOLD POWER. WHEN THEY

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.191
DECIDE SOME VOICES COUNT AND

02:06:39.258 --> 02:06:41.994
OTHERS DO NOT. THAT MEMORY

02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:45.698
NEVER LEAVES YOU. AND NOW I SEE

02:06:45.764 --> 02:06:46.298
TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES RUNNING

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:49.234
THE SAME PLAYBOOK ACROSS TEXAS,

02:06:49.301 --> 02:06:51.070
ACROSS FLORIDA, ACROSS THIS

02:06:51.136 --> 02:06:53.305
COUNTRY. THEY CANNOT WIN ON

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:55.040
IDEAS. THEY CANNOT WIN ON

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:57.242
COMPASSION. THEY CANNOT WIN ON

02:06:57.309 --> 02:07:00.045
THE MERITS. SO WHAT DO THEY DO?

02:07:00.112 --> 02:07:02.214
THEY CHANGE THE RULES. THEY RIG

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:05.117
THE LINES. AND AS OUR TEXAS

02:07:05.184 --> 02:07:06.151
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES SAID

02:07:06.218 --> 02:07:08.053
YESTERDAY, THEY SHIELD THEIR

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:11.824
RACISM WITH THEIR PARTY LINE.

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:13.392
THAT IS NOT PATRIOTISM. THAT IS

02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:15.728
OPPRESSION WITH A BALLOT IN ITS

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:18.464
HAND. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:20.399
TRUMP HAS ALREADY SHOWN US THE

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:23.002
LENGTHS HE WILL GO. HE SENT ICE

02:07:23.068 --> 02:07:24.770
AGENTS TO THE SCHOOLS WHERE OUR

02:07:24.837 --> 02:07:26.271
CHILDREN LEARN. THE CHURCHES WE

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:29.475
PRAY. THE FIELDS WHERE WE WORK

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:32.711
TO INTIMIDATE, TO DIVIDE AND TO

02:07:32.778 --> 02:07:35.247
SILENCE. DISSENT. HE WEAPONIZED

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:36.181
FEAR AGAINST IMMIGRANT FAMILIES

02:07:36.248 --> 02:07:38.717
BECAUSE HE KNOWS CRUELTY IS

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:41.020
CHEAPER THAN COMPASSION. HE

02:07:41.086 --> 02:07:43.222
TORE FAMILIES APART NOT TO KEEP

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:44.957
OUR COUNTRY SAFE, BUT TO SCORE

02:07:45.024 --> 02:07:48.494
POLITICAL POINTS. CALIFORNIA

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:50.162
PROTECTS FAMILIES. WE DO NOT

02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:52.631
DIVIDE THEM. AND LOOK AT

02:07:52.698 --> 02:07:54.733
HEALTHCARE. TRUMPS BIG UGLY

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.335
BILL RIPPED $900 BILLION OUT OF

02:07:56.402 --> 02:07:58.103
MEDICAID JUST TO LINE THE

02:07:58.170 --> 02:08:00.172
POCKETS OF THE WEALTHY FEW.

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:03.642
THAT IS NOT REFORM. THAT IS

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:05.310
ROBBERY. IT THREATENS COVERAGE

02:08:05.377 --> 02:08:07.679
FOR 3 MILLION CALIFORNIANS,

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:09.815
PUTS OUR SENIORS AT RISK, AND

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:11.884
SENDS RURAL HOSPITALS TO THEIR

02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:13.285
GRAVES. SENIORS, CHILDREN,

02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:15.554
WORKING FAMILIES LEFT WITH

02:08:15.621 --> 02:08:17.356
NOTHING. THAT'S NOT POLICY.

02:08:17.423 --> 02:08:21.427
THAT IS PUNISHMENT. THIS IS

02:08:21.493 --> 02:08:23.328
LIFE AND DEATH. AND YET, WHILE

02:08:23.395 --> 02:08:25.030
THEY STRIP OUR PEOPLE OF HEALTH

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:26.698
CARE, WHILE THEY WEAPONIZE

02:08:26.765 --> 02:08:27.299
IMMIGRATION RAIDS, WHILE THEY

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:29.468
TILT THE SCALES OF DEMOCRACY,

02:08:29.535 --> 02:08:32.571
WHAT THEY FEAR MOST IS NOT US.

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:34.540
WHAT THEY FEAR MOST IS THE

02:08:34.606 --> 02:08:37.242
PEOPLE. THIS IS WHY ACA MATTERS.

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:39.044
THIS MEASURE DOES NOT FORCE

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:41.447
MAPS ON ANYONE. IT GIVES

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:42.514
CALIFORNIA A CHOICE. IT LETS

02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:45.284
THE PEOPLE HOLD THE PEN AND

02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:48.387
DRAW THEIR FUTURE. SO I ASK,

02:08:48.454 --> 02:08:50.522
WHY ARE REPUBLICANS SO AFRAID

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:52.357
OF THE PEOPLE? WHY ARE THEY SO

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:55.160
AFRAID OF DEMOCRACY ITSELF?

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:57.229
EVERY STATE IN AMERICA SHOULD

02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:59.498
HAVE INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING.

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:01.033
EVERY VOTER SHOULD HAVE A

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:03.168
CHOICE. BUT UNTIL THEY DO,

02:09:03.235 --> 02:09:05.104
CALIFORNIA CANNOT AND WILL NOT

02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:07.973
PLAY BY RIGGED RULES. IF TEXAS

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.475
WANTS TO CARVE UP DISTRICTS TO

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:11.110
KEEP THEIR WANNABE DICTATOR IN

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:13.212
POWER, WE WILL NOT BOW. IF

02:09:13.278 --> 02:09:14.546
FLORIDA WANTS TO SILENCE VOTERS

02:09:14.613 --> 02:09:17.449
OF COLOR, WE WILL NOT SIT

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:18.450
QUIETLY. BECAUSE WHEN DEMOCRACY

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:20.552
IS ATTACKED, SILENCE IS

02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:23.021
SURRENDER. AND CALIFORNIA HAS

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:24.223
NEVER BEEN AND WILL NEVER BE A

02:09:24.289 --> 02:09:26.758
STATE THAT SURRENDERS.

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:28.393
CALIFORNIA WILL FIGHT BACK.

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:30.295
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:33.031
THE MAPS. THIS IS ABOUT DIGNITY.

02:09:33.098 --> 02:09:35.300
THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER A LATINO

02:09:35.367 --> 02:09:36.935
CHILD IN TEXAS, A BLACK FAMILY

02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:39.037
IN FLORIDA, OR AN IMMIGRANT

02:09:39.104 --> 02:09:40.439
COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA HAS A

02:09:40.506 --> 02:09:43.475
VOICE IN THEIR OWN DEMOCRACY.

02:09:43.542 --> 02:09:45.944
MEMBERS. HISTORY IS WATCHING.

02:09:46.011 --> 02:09:48.213
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE WATCHING.

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.415
AND THEY WILL REMEMBER NOT JUST

02:09:50.482 --> 02:09:52.117
WHAT WE SAID IN THIS CHAMBER,

02:09:52.184 --> 02:09:54.319
BUT WHETHER WE HAD THE COURAGE

02:09:54.386 --> 02:09:58.257
TO ACT. ACA IS THAT ACT. IT'S

02:09:58.323 --> 02:10:01.460
NOT JUST A BILL. IT'S A SHIELD.

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:03.228
A SHIELD AGAINST RACIST MAPS, A

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:04.396
SHIELD AGAINST VOTER

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:06.498
SUPPRESSION, A SHIELD FOR

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:08.867
DEMOCRACY ITSELF. IT'S NOT JUST

02:10:08.934 --> 02:10:11.170
A POLICY. IT'S A PROMISE, A

02:10:11.236 --> 02:10:12.738
PROMISE THAT DEMOCRACY IN

02:10:12.804 --> 02:10:14.239
CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE DICTATED

02:10:14.306 --> 02:10:16.408
BY THE HAND OF TYRANNY, BUT

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:18.410
WRITTEN BY THE WILL OF THE

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:20.212
PEOPLE. I DID NOT COME TO THIS

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:21.780
FLOOR, LIKE MANY OF YOU, WITH

02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:23.182
THE POLITE REQUEST, I CAME WITH

02:10:23.248 --> 02:10:25.250
A CALL, A CALL TO CONSCIENCE, A

02:10:25.317 --> 02:10:28.754
CALL TO COURAGE, AND A CALL TO

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.989
HISTORY. DEMOCRATS FIGHT TO

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:32.024
SURVIVE. REPUBLICANS FIGHT TO

02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:34.026
DOMINATE. AND WHEN YOU FIGHT TO

02:10:34.092 --> 02:10:36.328
DOMINATE, YOU STOP AT NOTHING.

02:10:36.395 --> 02:10:39.231
YOU CHEAT, YOU RIG, YOU KILL.

02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:41.333
DEMOCRACY IN THE PROCESS

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:43.969
BECAUSE DEMOCRACY MAY BEND. BUT

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:45.504
HERE IN CALIFORNIA, IT WILL NOT

02:10:45.571 --> 02:10:48.040
BREAK. NOT ON OUR WATCH, NOT ON

02:10:48.106 --> 02:10:50.776
THIS FLOOR, NOT IN THIS STATE.

02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:52.878
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

02:10:52.945 --> 02:10:55.147
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:10:55.214 --> 02:10:57.449
MEMBER MARK GONZALEZ, ASSEMBLY

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:59.017

BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE OF ADA TÍNH OF

OAKLAND, ALAMEDA AND EMERYVILLE

02:11:09.394 --> 02:11:11.363
AND AS A PROUD COAUTHOR OF ACT

02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:14.733
EIGHT, WHICH WOULD ALLOW EACH

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:15.901
AND EVERY CALIFORNIAN THE

02:11:15.968 --> 02:11:18.203
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON OUR

02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:21.039
VERY FUTURE. THE PRESIDENT AND

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:22.140
THE CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY HAVE

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:24.176
BEEN SO FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING

02:11:24.243 --> 02:11:26.144
THE DEEPLY UNPOPULAR POLICIES

02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:29.915
OF PROJECT 2025 THAT THEY

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:32.251
FORGOT ABOUT THE WILL AND NEEDS

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:35.020
OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVE.

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:37.489
SINCE THE POLICIES OF THE

02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:38.924
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND THAT

02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:40.592
MAJORITY ARE SO INCREDIBLY

02:11:40.659 --> 02:11:43.262
UNPOPULAR, THEY DECIDED THEY

02:11:43.328 --> 02:11:45.097
NEEDED TO REWRITE THE RULES TO

02:11:45.163 --> 02:11:47.299
WIN. FROM TEXAS TO FLORIDA TO

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:50.469
INDIANA. THIS ADMINISTRATION IS

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:51.970
PRESSURING GOVERNORS TO CREATE

02:11:52.037 --> 02:11:54.640
NEW RED DISTRICTS TO SILENCE

02:11:54.706 --> 02:11:58.076
AMERICANS NATIONWIDE. ACA EIGHT

02:11:58.143 --> 02:11:59.878
IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE

02:11:59.945 --> 02:12:02.414
LIFE THREATENING POLICIES THAT

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:03.282
TRUMP AND THIS MAJORITY

02:12:03.348 --> 02:12:07.019
CONGRESS HAVE TAKEN, AND THIS

02:12:07.085 --> 02:12:10.355
ACA IS OUR OPPORTUNITY, THE

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:14.226
PEOPLE'S OPPORTUNITY TO EMPOWER

02:12:14.293 --> 02:12:16.962
CALIFORNIANS TO NEUTRALIZE THAT

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:18.664
THREAT. CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.299
WITNESSING FOR THE FIRST HAND

02:12:20.365 --> 02:12:22.134
THE VERY DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF

02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.137
THIS PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHY WE

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:27.205
MUST TREAT THIS LIKE THE

02:12:27.272 --> 02:12:30.409
EMERGENCY THAT IT IS NOW.

02:12:30.475 --> 02:12:32.911
ILLNESS AND SUFFERING HAVE NO

02:12:32.978 --> 02:12:36.281
PARTY PREFERENCE, AND THE LIVES

02:12:36.348 --> 02:12:38.250
OF PEOPLE IN THESE DISTRICTS

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:40.552
ARE OUR COLLECTIVE

02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:42.487
RESPONSIBILITY. SO I WANT TO

02:12:42.554 --> 02:12:44.956
REMIND YOU, AS CHAIR OF THE

02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:47.993
ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE, WHAT

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:50.429
IS AT STAKE? JUST THIS WEEK,

02:12:50.495 --> 02:12:52.297
OUR COMMITTEE HAS GOTTEN TO

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:54.933
HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC, FROM OUR

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.335
AGENCIES, FROM HEALTH CARE

02:12:56.401 --> 02:12:58.270
FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE,

02:12:58.337 --> 02:13:00.072
FROM OUR ADVOCATES. WHAT H.R.

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:03.909
ONE, TRUMP'S BIG UGLY BILL WILL

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.944
HAVE, WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THAT

02:13:06.011 --> 02:13:08.046
WILL HAVE, HOW IT WILL ENSURE

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:10.582
THAT $900 BILLION IN MEDICAID

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:12.317
FUNDING TO PAY FOR TAX BREAKS

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:14.619
FOR THE ULTRA WEALTHY, HOW

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:17.055
THESE TAX CUTS WILL TAKE CARE

02:13:17.122 --> 02:13:19.324
OF OUT OF REACH. TAKE CARE OUT

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:21.460
OF REACH OF MANY OF OUR SENIORS,

02:13:21.526 --> 02:13:24.062
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. HOW OVER

02:13:24.129 --> 02:13:25.997
3 MILLION CALIFORNIANS COULD

02:13:26.064 --> 02:13:28.266
LOSE THEIR MEDI-CAL COVERAGE

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:30.535
UNDER THE NEW REPUBLICAN

02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:33.071
PROVISIONS PASSED. HOW OVER 100

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:35.140
PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINICS

02:13:35.207 --> 02:13:36.108
ACROSS THE STATE MAY BE FORCED

02:13:36.174 --> 02:13:39.911
TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS, ROBBING

02:13:39.978 --> 02:13:44.116
22,000 PEOPLE A MONTH, A MONTH

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:47.486
OF REPRODUCTIVE CARE, STI

02:13:47.552 --> 02:13:50.956
TESTING, CANCER, SCREENINGS OF

02:13:51.022 --> 02:13:53.658
WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE AND PUT OUT

02:13:53.725 --> 02:13:58.330
OF REACH. FOR DECADES. FOR THE

02:13:58.397 --> 02:14:02.134
FIRST TIME, OVER 1 MILLION

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.069
CALIFORNIANS WHO RELY ON THOSE

02:14:04.136 --> 02:14:07.172
SERVICES ANNUALLY. LET'S BE

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:10.041
REMINDED OF THE FACT THAT OUR

02:14:10.108 --> 02:14:11.443
HOSPITALS ARE RURAL HOSPITALS

02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:14.312
AS WELL. KERN VALLEY HEALTH

02:14:14.379 --> 02:14:17.282
CARE DISTRICT, OROVILLE

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:18.483
HOSPITAL, FAIRCHILD MEDICAL

02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:20.285
CENTER, AND THE COUNTLESS OTHER

02:14:20.352 --> 02:14:22.254
HEALTH CARE FACILITIES THAT ARE

02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:25.157
SCRAPING BY AS THE TRUMP CUTS

02:14:25.223 --> 02:14:28.293
AWAY AT CRUCIAL FUNDING FOR

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.729
THEM. HOW THIS IMPACTS EVERY

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:32.564
SINGLE ONE OF OUR HEALTH CARE

02:14:32.631 --> 02:14:34.933
SYSTEMS, DECIMATING OUR ABILITY

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.170
TO PROVIDE CARE FOR MILLIONS OF

02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:41.139
CALIFORNIANS. SO WHEN WE TALK

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:43.942
ABOUT WHAT'S AT STAKE, WHAT IS

02:14:44.009 --> 02:14:44.976
AT STAKE TODAY, WHAT IS AT

02:14:45.043 --> 02:14:48.480
STAKE IS THE VERY LIVES OF OUR

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:49.948
CONSTITUENTS. WE CANNOT BE

02:14:50.015 --> 02:14:53.185
MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT. SO TODAY,

02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:56.154
WE MUST ENSURE THAT EVERY

02:14:56.221 --> 02:14:58.023
CALIFORNIAN HAS THE ABILITY TO

02:14:58.089 --> 02:15:01.993
BE PROTECTED, TO BE REPRESENTED

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.095
IN CONGRESS, AND TO CONTINUE TO

02:15:04.162 --> 02:15:06.932
STAND UP AGAINST THE ATTACKS ON

02:15:06.998 --> 02:15:09.701
OUR DEMOCRACY, WHEREVER THEY

02:15:09.768 --> 02:15:13.171
MAY RISE. AND I JUST HAVE TO

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:16.074
SAY THIS AS A WOMAN, THE NEVER

02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:19.578
ENDING EXECUTIVE ORDERS, THE

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:22.214
INSISTENCE ON BASICALLY TAKING

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:26.551
US BACK TO A TIME WHEN WOMEN

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:29.120
HAVE NO VOICE, WHEN OUR PEOPLE

02:15:29.187 --> 02:15:31.256
HAVE NOT THE ABILITY TO LOVE

02:15:31.323 --> 02:15:35.327
WHO THEY WANT TO LOVE AND MARRY,

02:15:35.393 --> 02:15:36.461
WHO THEY WANT TO MARRY AND HAVE

02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:39.097
THAT BE RECOGNIZED AND BE ABLE

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:42.133
TO HAVE THE CARE THAT THEY NEED,

02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:44.202
WHETHER THAT BE ABORTION CARE

02:15:44.269 --> 02:15:47.072
OR BASIC HEALTH CARE. THAT IS

02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:49.774
THE WORLD THAT THIS MAJORITY

02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:52.010
CONGRESS IS TRYING TO TURN US

02:15:52.077 --> 02:15:54.446
BACK TO. AND I ABSOLUTELY

02:15:54.513 --> 02:15:59.117
REFUSE TO STAND HERE ON THIS

02:15:59.184 --> 02:16:03.088
GREEN CARPET AND LET CONGRESS

02:16:03.154 --> 02:16:05.557
AND THIS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

02:16:05.624 --> 02:16:08.159
DO THAT TO US, DO THAT TO

02:16:08.226 --> 02:16:09.861
CALIFORNIANS, DO THAT TO THIS

02:16:09.928 --> 02:16:13.865
COUNTRY. SO MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE

02:16:13.932 --> 02:16:14.833
ARE TAKING THESE ACTIONS

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:17.602
BECAUSE WE ARE IN UNPRECEDENTED

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:21.172
TIMES. 30S. ABSOLUTELY. AND WE

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:22.974
MUST TAKE PROTECTIVE ACTION.

02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:25.477
WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:16:25.544 --> 02:16:28.179
FOR YOUR VOTE ON H.R. EIGHT.

02:16:28.246 --> 02:16:29.381
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:32.651
BONTA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMAIO,

YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:38.023
MR. SPEAKER. GAVIN NEWSOM'S

02:16:38.089 --> 02:16:40.659
CORRUPT REDISTRICTING SCHEME IS

02:16:40.725 --> 02:16:43.228
WORSE THAN SNAKE OIL. IT'S

02:16:43.295 --> 02:16:47.599
ARSENIC TO OUR DEMOCRACY. YOU

02:16:47.666 --> 02:16:49.534
STAND HERE. HE'S OUT THERE

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:52.337
PONTIFICATING THAT IN ORDER TO

02:16:52.404 --> 02:16:55.540
SAVE DEMOCRACY, WE MUST DESTROY

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:58.176
IT IN ORDER TO EMPOWER THE

02:16:58.243 --> 02:17:00.478
PEOPLE, WE MUST SILENCE THEM

02:17:00.545 --> 02:17:03.615
AND STRIP POWER FROM THE

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:05.684
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:07.953
COMMITTEE. NO ONE IS GOING TO

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:12.557
FALL FOR THIS. THE VOTERS WANT

02:17:12.624 --> 02:17:16.194
CITIZENS TO DRAW THE LINES, NOT

02:17:16.261 --> 02:17:17.095
POLITICIANS. YOU SIT HERE AND

02:17:17.162 --> 02:17:19.164
SAY, LET THE VOTERS DECIDE.

02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:21.933
THEY HAVE ALREADY DECIDED IN

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.703
2010 OVER YOUR OBJECTION, OVER

02:17:24.769 --> 02:17:25.303
THE POLITICAL CLASSES.

02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:28.039
OBJECTION. THEY GATHERED

02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:30.342
SIGNATURES AND THEY PUT AN

02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:32.177
INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT THAT

02:17:32.243 --> 02:17:34.379
SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, NO MORE

02:17:34.446 --> 02:17:36.615
GERRYMANDERING. THEY SAW THE

02:17:36.681 --> 02:17:39.618
ILL THAT GERRYMANDERING

02:17:39.684 --> 02:17:41.987
REPRESENTS TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

02:17:42.053 --> 02:17:43.421
THEY SAW THE CORRUPTION. THEY

02:17:43.488 --> 02:17:45.156
SAW THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.

02:17:45.223 --> 02:17:47.692
THEY SAW THE BRIBERY, THE VOTE

02:17:47.759 --> 02:17:49.094
RIGGING, POLITICIANS CARVING

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.831
OUT COMMUNITIES, SILENCING

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:56.167
VOICES. AND THEY SAID, ENOUGH.

02:17:56.234 --> 02:17:57.335
NO MORE GERRYMANDERING. IN

02:17:57.402 --> 02:17:59.104
CALIFORNIA. OUR VOTERS ARE JUST,

02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:01.039
WELL, THEY'RE MORE ADVANCED

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:03.108
THAN OTHER STATES VOTERS. THEY

02:18:03.174 --> 02:18:05.210
GOT IT RIGHT A LOT EARLIER.

02:18:05.277 --> 02:18:07.379
THEY GAVE US A GOLD STANDARD IN

02:18:07.445 --> 02:18:08.013
THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

02:18:08.079 --> 02:18:09.314
COMMISSION. AND WHAT YOU'RE

02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:11.650
DOING IS SAYING, NO, WE DON'T

02:18:11.716 --> 02:18:13.084
CARE WHAT THEY SAID IN 2010. WE

02:18:13.151 --> 02:18:14.352
ARE NOT LISTENING TO THEM. WHAT

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:16.121
THEY VOTED FOR, TO STRIP THIS

02:18:16.187 --> 02:18:18.923
BODY OF THE POWER THAT YOU ARE

02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:20.225
NOW APPARENTLY EXERCISING IN

02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:22.093
VIOLATION OF THE STATE

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.228
CONSTITUTION. THE FACT THAT

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:24.462
WE'RE EVEN TALKING ABOUT

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:25.130
REDISTRICTING ON THIS FLOOR

02:18:25.196 --> 02:18:27.365
TODAY IS A VIOLATION OF THE

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:29.234
OATH TO UPHOLD THE STATE

02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:30.035
CONSTITUTION. THE FACT THAT

02:18:30.101 --> 02:18:33.905
WE'RE VOTING ON A MAP TODAY,

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:34.472
PURPORTEDLY DRAWN UP BY THE

02:18:34.539 --> 02:18:36.441
LEGISLATURE, IT'S IN VIOLATION

02:18:36.508 --> 02:18:37.375

02:18:37.442 --> 02:18:39.044
POSSESS THE AUTHORITY TO DO

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:41.179
THIS. THE VOTERS ALREADY

02:18:41.246 --> 02:18:43.014
DECIDED AND TOOK YOU OUT OF THE

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:45.150

IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS? THIS

02:18:56.027 --> 02:18:58.296
CIRCUS IS EXACTLY UNDERSCORING

02:18:58.363 --> 02:19:00.532
THE WISDOM OF THE VOTERS IN

02:19:00.598 --> 02:19:02.300
2010. LET ME GO THROUGH THE

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:03.435
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

02:19:03.501 --> 02:19:05.704

ARE PARAMOUNT AND DETERMINE THE

02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:44.002
OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. THE

02:20:44.068 --> 02:20:46.371
MAPS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:20:46.437 --> 02:20:48.239
IMPOSE ARE NOT COMPETITIVE, AND

02:20:48.306 --> 02:20:50.108
IN FACT, YOU TAKE RURAL VOTERS

02:20:50.175 --> 02:20:52.710
AND YOU SHOVE THEM IN WITH

02:20:52.777 --> 02:20:54.345
URBAN VOTERS TO DILUTE THEIR

02:20:54.412 --> 02:20:56.848

02:20:56.915 --> 02:20:58.950
WANT TO TALK ABOUT STRIPPING

02:20:59.017 --> 02:21:03.021
PEOPLE OF THEIR VOICE? I HEARD

02:21:03.087 --> 02:21:05.323
MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES,

02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:06.491
AND MANY OF YOU SAY, WE'RE

02:21:06.558 --> 02:21:07.258
DOING THIS TO PROTECT HEALTH

02:21:07.325 --> 02:21:09.260
CARE, 30S WE'RE DOING THIS

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:10.361
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS LOSING

02:21:10.428 --> 02:21:14.199
MONEY. I WISH YOU FOUGHT HARDER

02:21:14.265 --> 02:21:15.533
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THIS

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:17.202
STATE. AS HARD AS YOU'RE

02:21:17.268 --> 02:21:18.970
FIGHTING FOR SOME OF THESE

02:21:19.037 --> 02:21:20.305
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS, FOR

02:21:20.371 --> 02:21:21.239

02:21:21.306 --> 02:21:22.407
WISH YOU WOULD FIGHT TO

02:21:22.473 --> 02:21:24.242
ACTUALLY SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS

02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:25.210
HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:21:25.276 --> 02:21:28.279
THAT ACTUALLY MATTER. LOOK, THE

02:21:28.346 --> 02:21:29.414
VOTERS ARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.149
BE FORCED TO DECIDE THIS AGAIN.

02:21:31.216 --> 02:21:33.184
I THINK THAT ONCE THEY

02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:33.952
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON,

02:21:34.018 --> 02:21:36.187
THEY WILL VOTE YOU DOWN. NOW, I

02:21:36.254 --> 02:21:37.488

02:21:37.555 --> 02:21:40.191

AND LIKE AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF

02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:23.968
YOU IN THIS ROOM, I READ THE

02:22:24.035 --> 02:22:25.136
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, WHICH

02:22:25.203 --> 02:22:27.739
MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE ARE

02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:29.507
NOT APPROVING ANY MAPS IN THIS

02:22:29.574 --> 02:22:32.377
BODY. WE ARE GIVING THE VOTERS

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:34.345
THE DECISION, SOMETHING THAT

02:22:34.412 --> 02:22:36.381
ISN'T HAPPENING IN TEXAS. AND

02:22:36.447 --> 02:22:38.249
EVEN DOING THAT WAS SOMETHING

02:22:38.316 --> 02:22:40.885
WE HAD TO DEBATE FIERCELY.

02:22:40.952 --> 02:22:43.721
CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:22:43.788 --> 02:22:45.256
CALIFORNIANS AND CALIFORNIANS

02:22:45.323 --> 02:22:47.091
RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS COUNTRY.

02:22:47.158 --> 02:22:49.661
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THIS

02:22:49.727 --> 02:22:51.062
SITUATION. THE AUTHORITARIAN IN

02:22:51.129 --> 02:22:53.131
THE WHITE HOUSE PUT US IN THIS

02:22:53.197 --> 02:22:54.399
SITUATION WHEN HE USED HOUSE

02:22:54.465 --> 02:22:56.434
REPUBLICANS IN TEXAS TO

02:22:56.501 --> 02:22:57.302
DISENFRANCHIZE VULNERABLE

02:22:57.368 --> 02:22:59.470
PEOPLE. AFTER THOSE MAPS IN

02:22:59.537 --> 02:23:02.206
TEXAS ARE APPROVED, A LATINO

02:23:02.273 --> 02:23:03.942
VOICE IN TEXAS IS WORTH ONE

02:23:04.008 --> 02:23:06.444
THIRD OF THE REPRESENTATION AS

02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:08.513
A WHITE VOICE. A BLACK VOTER IN

02:23:08.579 --> 02:23:11.215
TEXAS IS WORTH ONE FIFTH OF THE

02:23:11.282 --> 02:23:12.050
REPRESENTATION OF A WHITE VOTER

02:23:12.116 --> 02:23:14.352
IN TEXAS. I DIDN'T SAY 3/5.

02:23:14.419 --> 02:23:16.955
THERE WAS NO COMPROMISE. I SAID

02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:19.190
ONE FIFTH. THAT IS THE KIND OF

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:20.725
GERRYMANDERING THAT IS THE KIND

02:23:20.792 --> 02:23:23.094
OF THEFT THAT THEY ARE

02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:26.030
PERPETUATING. AND WE CAN'T JUST

02:23:26.097 --> 02:23:29.167
SIT BY AND LET IT HAPPEN. WE

02:23:29.233 --> 02:23:30.401
WON'T JUST SIT BY AND LET IT

02:23:30.468 --> 02:23:32.904
HAPPEN. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:34.439
WE LOSE OURSELVES. THAT'S WHY

02:23:34.505 --> 02:23:36.374
WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF THE

02:23:36.441 --> 02:23:37.308
ELECTIONS COMMITTEE, I AUTHORED

02:23:37.375 --> 02:23:38.943
AN UPDATE TO THE FAIR MAPS ACT

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:40.244
THAT PREVENTED INCUMBENCY FROM

02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:42.480
BEING A CONSIDERATION IN MAP

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:43.514
DRAWING IN. EVERY SINGLE

02:23:43.581 --> 02:23:45.450
REPUBLICAN ON THIS FLOOR VOTED

02:23:45.516 --> 02:23:46.451
AGAINST IT. THAT'S WHY I

02:23:46.517 --> 02:23:47.986
AUTHORED LEGISLATION CALLING

02:23:48.052 --> 02:23:48.987

02:23:49.053 --> 02:23:50.588
COMMISSIONS ON SCHOOL BOARDS

02:23:50.655 --> 02:23:52.190
AND COUNTIES AND SPECIAL

02:23:52.256 --> 02:23:52.890
DISTRICTS ALL THROUGHOUT THE

02:23:52.957 --> 02:23:54.258
STATE, AND EVERY REPUBLICAN IN

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:57.562
THIS HOUSE VOTED AGAINST IT.

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.597
HOW CONVENIENT TO SWITCH YOUR

02:23:59.664 --> 02:24:01.566
TONE WHEN YOU ARE NOW ON THE

02:24:01.632 --> 02:24:03.634
LINE. WHEN WE ARE STEPPING UP

02:24:03.701 --> 02:24:04.535
AND SPEAKING THE WAY

02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:06.270
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE FOR US TO

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:07.638
STAND UP AND FIGHT BECAUSE WE

02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:09.340
ARE TIRED OF BEING THE PUNCHING

02:24:09.407 --> 02:24:11.275
BAG OF THIS COUNTRY WHEN WE

02:24:11.342 --> 02:24:12.110
FREELY GIVE. WHEN NORTH

02:24:12.176 --> 02:24:15.213
CAROLINA IS ON FIRE, WE SHOW UP.

02:24:15.279 --> 02:24:16.314
WHEN A HURRICANE HITS FLORIDA,

02:24:16.381 --> 02:24:18.349
WE SHOW UP. WHEN TEXAS IS

02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:21.185
WAIT FOR CANADA AND MEXICO TO

FEDERAL TAXES THAN WE GET BACK.

02:24:30.094 --> 02:24:32.563
WE DON'T COMPLAIN. WE KNOW OUR

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:33.164
ROLE IS TO SUPPORT OTHERS. AND

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:35.133
WHEN THE BIGGEST DISASTER TO

02:24:35.199 --> 02:24:37.135
EVER HIT OUR STATE HITS, AND WE

02:24:37.201 --> 02:24:39.904
ASK FOR A PORTION OF OUR OWN

02:24:39.971 --> 02:24:40.505
DOLLARS BACK AND YOU WITHHOLD

02:24:40.571 --> 02:24:46.177
IT. WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR TONE.

02:24:46.244 --> 02:24:49.047
WE HAVE TO STEP UP BECAUSE YOUR

02:24:49.113 --> 02:24:50.314
SILENCE IS DEAFENING. WHEN THEY

TOOK HEALTH CARE AND FOOD AND

02:24:53.117 --> 02:24:55.219
VETERANS ASSISTANCE, AND THEY

02:24:55.286 --> 02:24:56.487
MADE IT HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:58.489
GO TO COLLEGE, AND THEY PUT

02:24:58.556 --> 02:24:59.590
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

02:24:59.657 --> 02:25:00.625
NATIONAL DEBT. AND YOU SAID

02:25:00.691 --> 02:25:03.227
NOTHING THAT FORCED US TO STEP

02:25:03.294 --> 02:25:05.396
INTO THE VOID WHEN THEY HELD

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:07.065

02:25:11.369 --> 02:25:13.871
NOTHING. WE HAD TO STEP INTO

02:25:13.938 --> 02:25:14.972
THAT VOID. YOU TALK ABOUT

02:25:15.039 --> 02:25:17.442
FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE AND HOW

02:25:17.508 --> 02:25:18.342
WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT WHILE

02:25:18.409 --> 02:25:20.445

CRIMINALLY, I TOOK THAT

02:25:28.352 --> 02:25:29.087
PERSONALLY THAT YOU DIDN'T SAY

02:25:29.153 --> 02:25:32.824
ANYTHING. WE ARE NOT JUST GOING

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:35.359
TO SIT BY AND LET OUR DEMOCRACY

02:25:35.426 --> 02:25:37.562
CRUMBLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:25:37.628 --> 02:25:39.330
WE'RE STANDING ON BUSINESS AND

MR. SPEAKER. THAT WAS A MIC

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:55.012
DROP. I WASN'T GOING TO SAY

02:25:55.079 --> 02:25:58.116
ANYTHING, BUT TWO OF MY

02:25:58.182 --> 02:25:59.450
COLLEAGUES JUST SAID SOMETHING

02:25:59.517 --> 02:26:01.619
ABOUT BEING SILENT THAT CAUSED

02:26:01.686 --> 02:26:04.188
ME TO REFLECT ON WHAT I SAID ON

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:06.124
THIS FLOOR. OVER THE 11 YEARS

02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:08.359
THAT I'VE BEEN ON THIS FLOOR.

02:26:08.426 --> 02:26:10.194
AND LET ME JUST SAY AND JUST

02:26:10.261 --> 02:26:12.463
REPEAT WHAT I SAID, SINCE I'VE

02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:14.098
BEEN ON THIS GREEN CARPET FROM

02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:15.399
DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING

02:26:15.466 --> 02:26:18.102
JUNIOR, LIFE BEGINS TO END. THE

02:26:18.169 --> 02:26:20.338
LIFE BEGINS THE MOMENT YOU

02:26:20.404 --> 02:26:22.340
START BEING SILENT ABOUT THE

02:26:22.406 --> 02:26:24.208
THINGS THAT MATTER. IN THE END,

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:26.577
YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER THE WORDS

02:26:26.644 --> 02:26:28.346
OF YOUR ENEMIES, BUT THE

02:26:28.412 --> 02:26:30.214
SILENCE OF YOUR FRIENDS. SO

02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:32.416
BEING ON THIS FLOOR TODAY, I

02:26:32.483 --> 02:26:35.253
CANNOT SIT BY AND BE SILENT ON

02:26:35.319 --> 02:26:38.289
THE THINGS THAT MATTER. THIS IS

02:26:38.356 --> 02:26:42.426
A DEFINING MOMENT IN HISTORY IN

02:26:42.493 --> 02:26:44.529
CALIFORNIA. SO I KNOW WE

02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:58.509
GOVERNORS REFUSE TO STAND UP

02:26:58.576 --> 02:27:01.879
AND BE BOLD, TO STAND UP AND

02:27:01.946 --> 02:27:05.683
LET CALIFORNIA, TO STAND UP AND

STANDING UP AND BEING COUNTED

02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:42.954
WHEN THIS PRESIDENT, I AM

HAPPENED IN THIRD WORLD

02:27:59.670 --> 02:28:02.106

IF CALIFORNIA DO NOT DO THIS,

02:28:28.566 --> 02:28:30.935
WE ARE JUST HANDING OVER THE

02:28:31.002 --> 02:28:32.136
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED

02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:27.271
THE PEOPLE ARE BEING IGNORED.

02:32:27.338 --> 02:32:29.106
THE PEOPLE WHO WHO WANT THEIR

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:31.308
VOICES HEARD IN AN INDEPENDENT

02:32:31.375 --> 02:32:33.711
WAY. YESTERDAY'S WALL STREET

02:32:33.777 --> 02:32:37.214
JOURNAL SAID, AND I QUOTE THE

02:32:37.281 --> 02:32:39.116
REAL HOUSE. THIS IS THE HOUSE

02:32:39.183 --> 02:32:40.251
OF REPRESENTATIVES CONGRESS. WE

02:32:40.317 --> 02:32:43.821
WERE JUST MAKING REFERENCE TO

02:32:43.888 --> 02:32:45.389
DEMOCRATIC NIGHTMARE. THIS IS

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:47.925
ALL ABOUT NUMBERS. DEMOCRATS

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:51.161
COULD LOSE TEN SEATS IN 2030

02:32:51.228 --> 02:32:54.598
BECAUSE VOTERS ARE FLEEING THE

02:32:54.665 --> 02:32:56.934
BLUE STATES. REMIND US ALL,

02:32:57.001 --> 02:32:58.369
CALIFORNIA IS A BLUE STATE. SO

02:32:58.435 --> 02:33:03.407
LET ME GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS.

02:33:03.474 --> 02:33:07.478
START WITH THE NUMBERS. BETWEEN

02:33:07.545 --> 02:33:10.481
2020 AND 2024, CALIFORNIA LOST

02:33:10.548 --> 02:33:13.050
1.4 MILLION PEOPLE. AND WHERE

02:33:13.117 --> 02:33:15.352
DID THEY GO? THEY MAY HAVE GONE

02:33:15.419 --> 02:33:17.688
TO KANSAS. THAT IS LARGER THAN

02:33:17.755 --> 02:33:19.490
THE POPULATION OF KANSAS, HAVE

02:33:19.557 --> 02:33:22.393
LEFT CALIFORNIA, AND THAT

02:33:22.459 --> 02:33:24.595
RESULTED IN 2020. AND THE LOSS

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:27.131
OF FOUR CONGRESSIONAL SEATS IN

02:33:27.197 --> 02:33:29.300
CALIFORNIA. SO YOU'RE FIGHTING

02:33:29.366 --> 02:33:31.468
THE SUPERMAJORITY IS FIGHTING

02:33:31.535 --> 02:33:33.304
TO PROTECT SEATS THAT YOU THINK

02:33:33.370 --> 02:33:35.072
ARE GOING AWAY. YOU'VE ALREADY

02:33:35.139 --> 02:33:37.341
LOST THEM. WHY DID YOU ALREADY

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:39.243
LOSE THOSE FOUR SEATS, AND WHY

02:33:39.310 --> 02:33:41.245
ARE YOU CONTINUING? WHY IS THE

02:33:41.312 --> 02:33:42.379
OTHER PARTY CONTINUING? WHY IS

02:33:42.446 --> 02:33:45.082
CALIFORNIA LOSING POPULATION?

02:33:45.149 --> 02:33:46.350
WHY IS THAT AFFECTING

02:33:46.417 --> 02:33:47.217
CALIFORNIA? AND THE PROJECTION

02:33:47.284 --> 02:33:51.055
IS IN 2030, CALIFORNIA WILL

02:33:51.121 --> 02:33:54.458
LOSE FOUR MORE SEATS. WHY? AND

02:33:54.525 --> 02:33:57.828
ALSO AN ADDITIONAL FACT I DID

02:33:57.895 --> 02:34:00.264
NOT KNOW. BETWEEN 2020 AND 2024,

02:34:00.331 --> 02:34:02.199
CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION UNDER

02:34:02.266 --> 02:34:07.037
THE AGE OF 18 SHRANK BY 523,000

02:34:07.104 --> 02:34:09.807
PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO ASK

02:34:09.873 --> 02:34:10.975
OURSELVES, WHY ARE PEOPLE

02:34:11.041 --> 02:34:13.611
LEAVING CALIFORNIA? IT'S

02:34:13.677 --> 02:34:16.213
BECAUSE OF LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:18.382
ENACTED IN THIS STATE IN THE

02:34:18.449 --> 02:34:20.651
LAST 15 YEARS, THAT HAVE DRIVEN

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:22.252
OUT BUSINESS, THAT HAVE DRIVEN

02:34:22.319 --> 02:34:24.688
OUT PEOPLE FOR REASONS RELATED

02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:27.625
TO EDUCATION, THE QUALITY OF

02:34:27.691 --> 02:34:28.659
EDUCATION, THE QUALITY OF

02:34:28.726 --> 02:34:30.127
SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THEY

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:31.996
HAVE LEFT THE STATE. THEY'RE

02:34:32.062 --> 02:34:34.231
GOING TO OTHER STATES, WHETHER

02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:37.034
IT'S TEXAS, WHETHER IT'S OHIO,

02:34:37.101 --> 02:34:39.136
WHETHER IT'S FLORIDA, WHETHER

02:34:39.203 --> 02:34:40.871
IT'S NEVADA. THEY'RE GOING TO

02:34:40.938 --> 02:34:42.039
OTHER STATES BECAUSE THEY DO

02:34:42.106 --> 02:34:44.541
NOT LIKE THE POLICIES THAT ARE

02:34:44.608 --> 02:34:45.476
COMING OUT OF THIS STATE. SO

02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:48.145
UNTIL CALIFORNIA AND ITS

02:34:48.212 --> 02:34:50.047
REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS BODY

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:53.250
BEGIN TO REALIZE WHAT IS NOT

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:54.852
CONNECTING WITH THE LAWS THAT

02:34:54.918 --> 02:34:56.086
ARE BEING PASSED, AND THE

02:34:56.153 --> 02:34:58.922
PEOPLE, THE VOTERS OF

02:34:58.989 --> 02:34:59.356
CALIFORNIA, ALL THIS

02:34:59.423 --> 02:35:01.191
HISTRIONICS TODAY, ALL THIS THE

02:35:01.258 --> 02:35:03.927
SKY IS FALLING. CHICKEN LITTLE

02:35:03.994 --> 02:35:07.231
DEMOCRACY IS FAILING. 30S

02:35:07.297 --> 02:35:09.033
DEMOCRACY IS BEING SAVED BY

02:35:09.099 --> 02:35:10.234
PEOPLE WHO REALIZE IT'S NOT

02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:12.970
BEING REPRESENTED BY THE

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:14.805
SUPERMAJORITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:35:14.872 --> 02:35:16.373
HOLDING POWER IN THIS STATE FOR

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:18.242
THE LAST 10 OR 15 YEARS. LOOK

02:35:18.308 --> 02:35:21.245
AT OUR POLICY. BUT WE CAN FIND

02:35:21.311 --> 02:35:24.481
$250 MILLION FOR A SPECIAL

02:35:24.548 --> 02:35:25.115
ELECTION WHEN HEALTH CARE, WHEN

02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:27.518
COMMUNITY SAFETY. PROP 36

02:35:27.584 --> 02:35:30.087
WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT WIPED OFF

02:35:30.154 --> 02:35:32.322
THE WIPED OUT OF THE BUDGET.

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:34.458
BUT $250 MILLION MAGICALLY

02:35:34.525 --> 02:35:36.260
APPEARS TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY.

02:35:36.326 --> 02:35:39.496
DEMOCRACY STARTS HERE. KEEP

02:35:39.563 --> 02:35:40.964
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. KEEP OUR

02:35:41.031 --> 02:35:42.199
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA, KEEP

02:35:42.266 --> 02:35:44.168
OUR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:35:44.234 --> 02:35:45.469
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'LL HAVE MORE

02:35:45.536 --> 02:35:47.271
VOTES, PROBABLY, AND MORE

02:35:47.337 --> 02:35:49.239
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION.

02:35:49.306 --> 02:35:50.107
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:35:50.174 --> 02:35:53.577
DIXON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:35:53.644 --> 02:35:54.611
ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACKSON, YOU

02:35:54.678 --> 02:36:00.084
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY

02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:02.319
MUCH, MR. SPEAKER. PERMISSION

02:36:02.386 --> 02:36:06.190
TO HAVE A PROP? MR. JACKSON, WE

02:36:06.256 --> 02:36:07.458
ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW PROPS

02:36:07.524 --> 02:36:10.127
TODAY. NOT A PROBLEM. MR.

02:36:10.194 --> 02:36:12.296
SPEAKER. I WANTED TO RISE

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:15.199
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO HAVE A

02:36:15.265 --> 02:36:17.968
THOROUGH DISCUSSION OR DEBATE

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:21.338
IN WHICH TODAY HAS BEEN A VERY

02:36:21.405 --> 02:36:24.308
GOOD DEBATE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:27.111
THE ROLE OF DEMOCRACY, IT

02:36:27.177 --> 02:36:29.947
SIMPLY CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT A

02:36:30.013 --> 02:36:32.216
REAL CONSIDERATION AND A REAL

02:36:32.282 --> 02:36:38.622
REVIEW OF OUR US CONSTITUTION.

02:36:38.689 --> 02:36:41.391
AND THE FEDERALIST PAPERS

02:36:41.458 --> 02:36:47.264
THEMSELVES. TO UNDERSTAND. THE

02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:52.903
REAL WISDOM OF OUR FOUNDERS.

02:36:52.970 --> 02:36:55.239
AND JUST HOW MUCH THOUGHT THEY

02:36:55.305 --> 02:37:00.477
PUT INTO. ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:37:00.544 --> 02:37:02.179
CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WERE

02:37:02.246 --> 02:37:05.682
NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THIS

02:37:05.749 --> 02:37:10.888
DEMOCRACY CAN HOLD. AND ONE OF

02:37:10.954 --> 02:37:14.124
THOSE THINGS IS FOUND IN THE

02:37:14.191 --> 02:37:15.826
FEDERALIST PAPERS, NUMBER TEN,

02:37:15.893 --> 02:37:17.628
WHERE MADISON SPECIFICALLY

02:37:17.694 --> 02:37:20.030
TALKS ABOUT THE ROLES OF THE

02:37:20.097 --> 02:37:25.602
STATE. AND OVER 200 YEARS AGO,

02:37:25.669 --> 02:37:27.871
MADISON SAID THAT THERE WILL BE

02:37:27.938 --> 02:37:31.241
A TIME. WHERE A FRACTIOUS

02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:36.079
LEADER WILL EMERGE. AND THAT

02:37:36.146 --> 02:37:38.515
FRACTIOUS LEADER WILL BEGIN TO

02:37:38.582 --> 02:37:42.186
DO THINGS TO CONSOLIDATE POWER.

02:37:42.252 --> 02:37:47.291
THERE WILL BE A TIME. WHEN THE

02:37:47.357 --> 02:37:49.660
EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATIVE

02:37:49.726 --> 02:37:52.329
AND THE JUDICIARY FAIL THEIR

02:37:52.396 --> 02:37:53.997
CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY

02:37:54.064 --> 02:37:57.401
TO PROPERLY PROVIDE A CHECK AND

02:37:57.467 --> 02:38:02.639
BALANCE. SO MADISON SAYS,

02:38:02.706 --> 02:38:04.341
THEREFORE, IS NOW UP TO THE

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:09.580
STATES. TO PROVIDE YET ANOTHER

02:38:09.646 --> 02:38:14.952
STOPGAP. TO BEGIN TO HOLD ON,

02:38:15.018 --> 02:38:17.821
TO SLOW DOWN THIS FRACTIOUS

02:38:17.888 --> 02:38:20.390
MOVEMENT UNTIL THE NEXT

02:38:20.457 --> 02:38:25.295
ELECTION CYCLE. SO THERE IS

02:38:25.362 --> 02:38:28.165
SOMETHING SPECIAL THAT WE ARE

02:38:28.232 --> 02:38:31.802
DOING TODAY. THERE IS SOMETHING

02:38:31.869 --> 02:38:35.772
VERY CONSTITUTIONAL THAT WE ARE

02:38:35.839 --> 02:38:41.645
DOING TODAY. TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:38:41.712 --> 02:38:46.450
DO OUR PART. OF HAVING THE MOST

02:38:46.516 --> 02:38:50.454
FAIR ELECTION PROCESS AS

02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:52.756
POSSIBLE, GIVEN THE

02:38:52.823 --> 02:38:58.562
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE NATION.

02:38:58.629 --> 02:38:59.963
AND THEN IN THE FEDERALIST

02:39:00.030 --> 02:39:02.599
PAPERS, NUMBER 16, HAMILTON

02:39:02.666 --> 02:39:08.171
SAYS. THAT AT THE END OF THE

02:39:08.238 --> 02:39:12.242
DAY. WHEN OUR THREE BRANCHES OF

02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:16.280
GOVERNMENT MAY FAIL. EVEN THE

02:39:16.346 --> 02:39:20.150
ACTIONS OF STATES MAY FAIL. BUT

02:39:20.217 --> 02:39:21.885
HAMILTON SAYS SOMETHING

02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:25.389
BEAUTIFUL. HE SAYS, WHEN ALL

02:39:25.455 --> 02:39:31.361
ELSE FAILS. THAT THE NUMBER ONE

02:39:31.428 --> 02:39:34.865
PROTECTOR OF OUR DEMOCRACY, HE

02:39:34.932 --> 02:39:39.169
CALLS THE NATURAL GUARDIANS AND

02:39:39.236 --> 02:39:41.371
THOSE NATURAL GUARDIANS ARE THE

02:39:41.438 --> 02:39:49.379
PEOPLE THEMSELVES. AND SO AN

02:39:49.446 --> 02:39:51.081
ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL

02:39:51.148 --> 02:39:55.285
AMENDMENT SAYS. THE LEGISLATURE

02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:59.256
HAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU

02:39:59.323 --> 02:40:02.659
NATURAL GUARDIANS THAT WE

02:40:02.726 --> 02:40:04.227
BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR

02:40:04.294 --> 02:40:10.300
YOU TO CONSIDER. BUT AT THE END

02:40:10.367 --> 02:40:13.603
OF THE DAY, THIS DEMOCRACY IS

02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:14.972
NOT OURS. WE ARE ONLY YOUR

02:40:15.038 --> 02:40:17.074
REPRESENTATIVES. AT THE END OF

02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:19.843
THE DAY, THE DEMOCRACY AND THE

02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:20.944
PRESERVATION OF THIS DEMOCRACY

02:40:21.011 --> 02:40:25.749
LIES IN YOUR HANDS. 30S

02:40:25.816 --> 02:40:28.018
THEREFORE, THERE IS NOTHING

02:40:28.085 --> 02:40:30.053
MORE DEMOCRATIC. THERE IS

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:32.456
NOTHING MORE CONSTITUTIONAL.

02:40:32.522 --> 02:40:34.424
THERE IS NOTHING THAT FULFILLS

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:36.360
BOTH THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT

02:40:36.426 --> 02:40:39.096
OF OUR DEMOCRACY THAN TO ALLOW

02:40:39.162 --> 02:40:41.898
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO

02:40:41.965 --> 02:40:44.067
MAKE THE FINAL SAY. I

02:40:44.134 --> 02:40:45.902
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

02:40:45.969 --> 02:40:47.604
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:40:47.671 --> 02:40:50.040
MEMBER JACKSON, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:40:50.107 --> 02:40:53.076
BENNETT, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

02:40:53.143 --> 02:40:54.644
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR.

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:57.614
SPEAKER. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY

02:40:57.681 --> 02:41:00.684
POWERFUL, LOGICAL, COGENT

02:41:00.751 --> 02:41:02.185
ARGUMENTS MADE TODAY, AND SO I

02:41:02.252 --> 02:41:04.021
HOPE MY HUMBLE COMMENTS CAN

02:41:04.087 --> 02:41:06.656
JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT. I WOULD

02:41:06.723 --> 02:41:08.725
LIKE TO DIRECT MY COMMENTS TO

02:41:08.792 --> 02:41:09.893
THOSE DEMOCRATIC ADVOCATES IN

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:13.196
OUR STATE WHO ARE QUESTIONING

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:15.098
WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE

02:41:15.165 --> 02:41:17.667
FOR US TO MAKE, WHO ARE

02:41:17.734 --> 02:41:20.003
WONDERING WHETHER THIS

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:21.772
POLITICAL EFFORT TO COUNTER

02:41:21.838 --> 02:41:24.074
TEXAS IS THE APPROPRIATE THING.

02:41:24.141 --> 02:41:26.910
BUT I'D LIKE TO SAY TO THEM,

02:41:26.977 --> 02:41:29.179
LET'S PUT THIS MOMENT IN

02:41:29.246 --> 02:41:31.748
NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. LET'S PUT

02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:34.084
IT IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE. LET'S

02:41:34.151 --> 02:41:35.986
PUT IT IN HISTORICAL

02:41:36.053 --> 02:41:38.255
PERSPECTIVE. AND THAT IS THAT

02:41:38.321 --> 02:41:39.890
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A

02:41:39.956 --> 02:41:42.225
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HOW DO YOU

02:41:42.292 --> 02:41:44.528
TRANSFER POWER? HOW DO

02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:46.063
GOVERNMENTS TRANSFER POWER. AND

02:41:46.129 --> 02:41:50.267
IT CAN BE DONE BY VIOLENT BRUTE

02:41:50.333 --> 02:41:52.069
FORCE, OR IT CAN BE DONE BY

02:41:52.135 --> 02:41:55.372
DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS. AND OUR

02:41:55.439 --> 02:41:56.373
FOUNDING FATHERS, TO THEIR

02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:59.409
GREAT CREDIT. AND I WISH THERE

02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:02.546
WERE MOTHERS THERE ALSO. RIGHT?

02:42:02.612 --> 02:42:06.550
THEY SENT US DOWN ON A PATH

02:42:06.616 --> 02:42:07.918
WHERE WE TRANSFER POWER

02:42:07.984 --> 02:42:10.087
PEACEFULLY BY FOLLOWING CERTAIN

02:42:10.153 --> 02:42:12.989
DEMOCRATIC RULES AND NORMS AS

02:42:13.056 --> 02:42:15.959
WE MOVE ON. AND FOLLOWING THOSE

02:42:16.026 --> 02:42:18.061
RULES HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL FOR US

02:42:18.128 --> 02:42:20.464
AS WE MOVE. BUT TODAY, IN THE

02:42:20.530 --> 02:42:22.165
WORLD, IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN

02:42:22.232 --> 02:42:25.068
THE WORLD, WE HAVE AUTOCRATS

02:42:25.135 --> 02:42:28.371
THAT ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO

02:42:28.438 --> 02:42:29.272
CONSOLIDATE THEIR POWER BY

02:42:29.339 --> 02:42:31.108
WEAKENING DEMOCRACY, BY

02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:33.944
CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME.

02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:36.179
AND SO TO MY FRIENDS OUT THERE

02:42:36.246 --> 02:42:37.180
THAT ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER

02:42:37.247 --> 02:42:39.149
THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE, I WANT

02:42:39.216 --> 02:42:42.919
TO SAY AUTOCRATS ARE COUNTING

02:42:42.986 --> 02:42:46.156
ON YOU TO STAND BY AND SAY, YOU

02:42:46.223 --> 02:42:48.725
KNOW, I LIKE THE OLD RULES. I

02:42:48.792 --> 02:42:50.160
WANT TO PLAY BY THE OLD RULES.

02:42:50.227 --> 02:42:52.729
I DON'T LIKE THE NEW RULES. AND

02:42:52.796 --> 02:42:54.498
THEY'RE COUNTING ON YOU TO DO

02:42:54.564 --> 02:42:56.433
THAT. WHILE THEY CONSOLIDATE

02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:59.035
POWER WITH THEIR NEW RULES. AND

02:42:59.102 --> 02:43:01.905
IT'S A FALSE SCENARIO TO SAY

02:43:01.972 --> 02:43:04.307
THAT WE CAN DEFEAT THAT, THAT

02:43:04.374 --> 02:43:06.977
WE CAN WIN BY HOLDING ON TO THE

02:43:07.043 --> 02:43:08.378
OLD RULES WHILE SOMEBODY

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:10.247
CONSOLIDATES POWER. A FEW

02:43:10.313 --> 02:43:13.416
DECADES AGO, RUSSIANS HAD

02:43:13.483 --> 02:43:16.186
DEMOCRACY, BUT RUSSIANS LOST

02:43:16.253 --> 02:43:19.322
THAT DEMOCRACY AS AUTOCRATS AND

02:43:19.389 --> 02:43:20.957
THE OLIGARCHS CONSOLIDATED

02:43:21.024 --> 02:43:23.460
POWER, THEY ONLY HAVE TO GET

02:43:23.527 --> 02:43:25.662
ENOUGH TO BE AT A TIPPING POINT.

02:43:25.729 --> 02:43:27.230
AND NOW TODAY, AND I WANT TO

02:43:27.297 --> 02:43:29.332
COMPLIMENT MY COLLEAGUE ACROSS

02:43:29.399 --> 02:43:31.168
THE AISLE WHO ADMITTED THAT

02:43:31.234 --> 02:43:35.038
WHAT TEXAS IS DOING IS WRONG. I

02:43:35.105 --> 02:43:37.374
REALLY ADMIRE THAT. BUT TURNING

02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:40.110
THE OTHER CHEEK IS NOT THE WAY

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:42.179
TO FIGHT THIS PARTICULAR

02:43:42.245 --> 02:43:43.113
SITUATION. RUSSIANS TURN THE

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:45.248
OTHER CHEEK AND THEY NO LONGER

02:43:45.315 --> 02:43:47.984
HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIGHT BACK.

02:43:48.051 --> 02:43:50.720
TODAY, TEXAS IS CHANGING THE

02:43:50.787 --> 02:43:53.023
RULES IN A WAY THAT WEAKENS

02:43:53.089 --> 02:43:55.192
CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO HAVE

02:43:55.258 --> 02:43:57.994
INPUT ON WHO CONTROLS THE VAST

02:43:58.061 --> 02:44:00.463
POWERS OF THE FEDERAL

02:44:00.530 --> 02:44:01.264
GOVERNMENT. IF CALIFORNIA'S

02:44:01.331 --> 02:44:04.201
DON'T TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO

02:44:04.267 --> 02:44:07.137
BLOCK TEXAS'S ACTION, WE COME

02:44:07.204 --> 02:44:09.906
ONE STEP CLOSER TO LOSING OUR

02:44:09.973 --> 02:44:12.409
ABILITY TO BLOCK THE AUTOCRATS

02:44:12.475 --> 02:44:13.977
AND THE OLIGARCHS OUT THERE. WE

02:44:14.044 --> 02:44:16.179
COME ONE STEP CLOSER TO

02:44:16.246 --> 02:44:18.281
BECOMING A COUNTRY DOMINATED BY

02:44:18.348 --> 02:44:21.151
THOSE OLIGARCHS, ONE STEP

02:44:21.218 --> 02:44:22.953
CLOSER TO LETTING INTIMIDATION

02:44:23.019 --> 02:44:26.656
AND DECEIT AND FALSE OUTRAGE

02:44:26.723 --> 02:44:29.059
THAT'S PAID FOR BY THE

02:44:29.125 --> 02:44:31.494
OLIGARCHS. WITH MEDIA OUTLETS

02:44:31.561 --> 02:44:34.164
THAT PUT DAILY FALSE OUTRAGE,

02:44:34.231 --> 02:44:37.000
THAT Ã, THAT APPEALS AND

02:44:37.067 --> 02:44:39.236
CONFUSES THE VOTERS OF THE

02:44:39.302 --> 02:44:41.371
UNITED STATES. AND WE COME ONE

02:44:41.438 --> 02:44:43.506
STEP CLOSER TO THAT KIND OF

02:44:43.573 --> 02:44:45.342
SOCIETY. IF WE DON'T TAKE THIS

02:44:45.408 --> 02:44:48.211
VERY IMPORTANT STEP TO COUNTER

02:44:48.278 --> 02:44:51.381
THIS, BECAUSE ONCE YOU LOSE,

02:44:51.448 --> 02:44:53.850
ONCE YOU CROSS THAT CRITICAL

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:56.119
THRESHOLD, YOU MAY NEVER BE

02:44:56.186 --> 02:44:58.355
ABLE TO GO BACK TO WHAT WE HAD.

02:44:58.421 --> 02:45:01.191
SO TO MY DEAR FRIENDS THAT ARE

02:45:01.258 --> 02:45:02.359
OUT THERE THAT HAVE CONTACTED

02:45:02.425 --> 02:45:05.462
ME AND SAY, I DON'T KNOW, I

02:45:05.528 --> 02:45:07.464
HOPE YOU WILL REMEMBER AND KEEP

02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:10.200
IN MIND THE HISTORICAL MOMENT

02:45:10.267 --> 02:45:14.137
THAT THIS IS HERE TODAY. 30S.

02:45:14.204 --> 02:45:16.706
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'LL CEDE

02:45:16.773 --> 02:45:19.209
MY 30S AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:45:19.276 --> 02:45:21.378
THE AYE VOTE ON ACH. THANK YOU.

02:45:21.444 --> 02:45:23.079
THANK YOU, MISTER BENNETT.

02:45:23.146 --> 02:45:24.347
MEMBERS, THE DRILLING THAT YOU

02:45:24.414 --> 02:45:25.949
HEAR IS NOT INSIDE YOUR HEAD.

02:45:26.016 --> 02:45:28.218
IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE IN

02:45:28.285 --> 02:45:29.686
THE CONSTRUCTION. I WANT TO

02:45:29.753 --> 02:45:31.655
REMIND ALL MEMBERS THAT IT IS

02:45:31.721 --> 02:45:32.589
NOT PICKED UP ON YOUR

02:45:32.656 --> 02:45:34.291
MICROPHONES. PLEASE CONTINUE.

02:45:34.357 --> 02:45:37.160
ASSEMBLY MEMBER EL-HAWARY, YOU

02:45:37.227 --> 02:45:41.231
ARE RECOGNIZED. GOOD MORNING,

02:45:41.298 --> 02:45:42.999
MR. SPEAKER, AND MEMBERS, I

02:45:43.066 --> 02:45:46.036
RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR EIGHT

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:48.505
BECAUSE THE ONLY REASON WE'RE

02:45:48.571 --> 02:45:51.207
HERE TODAY IS DONALD TRUMP. AND

02:45:51.274 --> 02:45:54.277
REPUBLICANS ARE TERRIFIED OF

02:45:54.344 --> 02:45:57.213
VOTERS. THEY KNOW PEOPLE AREN'T

02:45:57.280 --> 02:45:59.215
BUYING THEIR LIES, SO THEY'RE

02:45:59.282 --> 02:46:01.351
TRYING TO RIG THE RULES AND

02:46:01.418 --> 02:46:05.155
CHEAT THE GAME AT THE SAME TIME.

02:46:05.221 --> 02:46:07.123
TRUMP HAS WEAPONIZED

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:11.261
IMMIGRATION TO CREATE FEAR. AND

02:46:11.328 --> 02:46:13.196
WHAT DID REPUBLICANS IN

02:46:13.263 --> 02:46:16.366
WASHINGTON DO? THEY RESPONDED

02:46:16.433 --> 02:46:19.736
BY GIVING ICE MORE MONEY TO

02:46:19.803 --> 02:46:22.505
TEAR EVEN MORE FAMILIES APART.

02:46:22.572 --> 02:46:25.108
IN MY DISTRICT, THAT MEANS

02:46:25.175 --> 02:46:27.177
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE BEING

02:46:27.243 --> 02:46:29.646
RACIALLY PROFILED, AMERICAN

02:46:29.713 --> 02:46:32.248
CITIZENS WHO ARE PICKED UP BY

02:46:32.315 --> 02:46:33.883
FEDERAL AGENTS JUST FOR THE

02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:36.686
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. IT MEANS

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:40.190
FAMILIES WHO ARE TOO SCARED TO

02:46:40.256 --> 02:46:42.759
LEAVE THEIR HOMES, FAMILIES

02:46:42.826 --> 02:46:45.628
LIKE MY OWN, MY GUATEMALAN

02:46:45.695 --> 02:46:47.130
MOTHER AND MY MEXICAN

02:46:47.197 --> 02:46:49.766
STEPFATHER, BOTH AMERICAN

02:46:49.833 --> 02:46:50.467
CITIZENS WHO ARE AFRAID TO

02:46:50.533 --> 02:46:54.371
LEAVE THEIR HOME BECAUSE THIS

02:46:54.437 --> 02:46:55.905
IS NOT ABOUT DEMOCRACY, IT'S

02:46:55.972 --> 02:46:58.742
ABOUT INTIMIDATION. AND IT'S

02:46:58.808 --> 02:47:04.114
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND NOW TRUMP

02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:04.948
IS REPEATING SOME OF THE

02:47:05.014 --> 02:47:07.817
UGLIEST TIMES IN OUR NATION'S

02:47:07.884 --> 02:47:10.320
HISTORY. HE WANTS A CENSUS THAT

02:47:10.387 --> 02:47:12.155
EXCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED

02:47:12.222 --> 02:47:14.290
IMMIGRANTS THE SAME WAY THEY

02:47:14.357 --> 02:47:17.093
TRIED TO ENSURE THAT ENSLAVED

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:19.229
PEOPLE WERE NOT FULLY COUNTED

02:47:19.295 --> 02:47:21.531
BACK WHEN THEY FIRST CREATED

02:47:21.598 --> 02:47:23.400
THE CONSTITUTION. AND AS IF

02:47:23.466 --> 02:47:26.202
THAT WERE NOT ENOUGH, HE'S ALSO

02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:27.504
PUSHING TO CANCEL MAIL IN

02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:30.440
BALLOTS, SILENCING MILLIONS OF

02:47:30.507 --> 02:47:32.609
VOTERS WHO DEPEND ON THEIR

02:47:32.675 --> 02:47:36.446
RIGHT TO VOTE. TO THOSE ON THE

02:47:36.513 --> 02:47:38.381
OTHER SIDE, EXPLAIN HOW

02:47:38.448 --> 02:47:39.215
SILENCING VOTERS IS THE SAME

02:47:39.282 --> 02:47:41.985
THING AS PROTECTING THEM. OR IS

02:47:42.051 --> 02:47:45.522
IT JUST ABOUT PROTECTING YOUR

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:47.490
POWER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL? SO

02:47:47.557 --> 02:47:50.393
WHEN REPUBLICANS STAND UP HERE

02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.128
TALKING ABOUT TRANSPARENCY OR

02:47:52.195 --> 02:47:54.097
PROTECTING VOTERS, DON'T BE

02:47:54.164 --> 02:47:57.133
FOOLED. THE TRUTH IS, THE

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.502
CRISIS STARTED IN A REPUBLICAN

02:47:59.569 --> 02:48:03.606
STATE. TEXAS LIT A MATCH, AND

02:48:03.673 --> 02:48:04.374
CALIFORNIA IS SIMPLY LEVELING

02:48:04.441 --> 02:48:07.010
THE PLAYING FIELD INSTEAD OF

02:48:07.076 --> 02:48:09.879
WAITING UNTIL ABBOTT AND TRUMP

02:48:09.946 --> 02:48:13.950
BURN OUR OWN HOUSE DOWN. ACA

02:48:14.017 --> 02:48:16.453
DOES NOT GIVE US AN ADVANTAGE.

02:48:16.519 --> 02:48:18.721
IT GIVES US FAIRNESS. AND LET'S

02:48:18.788 --> 02:48:20.323
NOT FORGET THIS IS GOING TO THE

02:48:20.390 --> 02:48:24.527
VOTERS. SO IF YOU ARE OPPOSING

02:48:24.594 --> 02:48:26.329
THIS, YOU ARE SIDING WITH

02:48:26.396 --> 02:48:30.934
HYPOCRISY AND VOTER SUPPRESSION.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.169
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:48:33.236 --> 02:48:35.305
WHAT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL. YOU

02:48:35.371 --> 02:48:37.307
ONLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S

02:48:37.373 --> 02:48:38.308
UNCONSTITUTIONAL WHEN IT COMES

02:48:38.374 --> 02:48:39.409
TO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS

02:48:39.476 --> 02:48:40.944
HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:42.846
WHEN IT'S THE UNITED STATES OF

02:48:42.912 --> 02:48:44.647
AMERICA, YOU'RE OKAY WITH TRUMP

02:48:44.714 --> 02:48:47.317
AND TRUMP PANDERING. I URGE AN

02:48:47.383 --> 02:48:50.220
I VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:48:50.286 --> 02:48:52.956
ASSEMBLY MEMBER EL-HAWARY.

02:48:53.022 --> 02:48:54.757
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GABRIEL, YOU

02:48:54.824 --> 02:49:00.497
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY

02:49:00.563 --> 02:49:01.931
MUCH, MR. SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES,

02:49:01.998 --> 02:49:05.301
I RISE TODAY WITH WITH SADNESS

02:49:05.368 --> 02:49:08.137
AND ALSO WITH CONVICTION. AND I

02:49:08.204 --> 02:49:10.139
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, AS MANY

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.341
OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID,

02:49:11.407 --> 02:49:13.643
THAT WE TAKE A MOMENT AND STEP

02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:15.478
BACK AND ASK OURSELVES, HOW DID

02:49:15.545 --> 02:49:18.114
WE ARRIVE AT THIS MOMENT? AND I

02:49:18.181 --> 02:49:20.083
SEE IT, AS I OFTEN DO, THROUGH

02:49:20.149 --> 02:49:23.052
MY LENSES AS A PARENT, AS A

02:49:23.119 --> 02:49:25.388
FATHER OF YOUNG KIDS. AND I

02:49:25.455 --> 02:49:27.090
WILL TELL YOU, EVERYONE WHO HAS

02:49:27.156 --> 02:49:28.291
HAD THE BLESSING OF BEING A

02:49:28.358 --> 02:49:29.726
PARENT UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS

02:49:29.792 --> 02:49:31.261
GOING ON HERE. START PLAYING A

02:49:31.327 --> 02:49:33.229
CARD GAME WITH MY FIVE YEAR OLD.

02:49:33.296 --> 02:49:34.264
HE FEELS LIKE IT ISN'T GOING

02:49:34.330 --> 02:49:37.133
HIS WAY. HE FEELS LIKE HE MIGHT

02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:39.569
LOSE AND SO HE STARTS TO CHANGE

02:49:39.636 --> 02:49:41.137
THE RULES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE

02:49:41.204 --> 02:49:42.505
HAVE. THAT IS TRANSPARENTLY

02:49:42.572 --> 02:49:44.140
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS

02:49:44.207 --> 02:49:45.775
PRESIDENT. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT

02:49:45.842 --> 02:49:47.677
HIS POLICIES ARE NOT POPULAR.

02:49:47.744 --> 02:49:49.078
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT PEOPLE DO

02:49:49.145 --> 02:49:50.947
NOT WANT HIM TO CONTINUE TO BE

02:49:51.014 --> 02:49:52.982
ABLE TO BE UNCHECKED IN

02:49:53.049 --> 02:49:54.417
WASHINGTON. AND SO RATHER THAN

02:49:54.484 --> 02:49:56.386
CHANGE HIS POLICIES OR PLAY BY

02:49:56.452 --> 02:49:58.321
THE RULES, HE'S TRYING TO

02:49:58.388 --> 02:50:00.390
CHANGE THE RULES. AND THEY ARE

02:50:00.456 --> 02:50:01.291
MOVING FORWARD AND CHANGING THE

02:50:01.357 --> 02:50:03.293
RULES IN THE MOST UNDEMOCRATIC

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:06.029
FASHION. AND THAT HAS PUT THOSE

02:50:06.095 --> 02:50:08.531
OF US IN CALIFORNIA IN A VERY

02:50:08.598 --> 02:50:09.632
DIFFICULT POSITION. HOW DO WE

02:50:09.699 --> 02:50:13.102
RESPOND? WHAT DO WE DO IN THIS

02:50:13.169 --> 02:50:14.604
MOMENT AND WHAT WE HAVE FROM

02:50:14.671 --> 02:50:16.039
OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER

02:50:16.105 --> 02:50:17.307
SIDE OF THE AISLE IS IS SAYING

02:50:17.373 --> 02:50:19.409
IT CLOSE YOUR EYES, BE

02:50:19.475 --> 02:50:20.243
WILLFULLY BLIND, IGNORE WHAT IS

02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:22.245
HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE

02:50:22.312 --> 02:50:24.514
COUNTRY, AS IF WE IN CALIFORNIA

02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:26.082
ARE IMMUNE TO THAT. STAND DOWN.

02:50:26.149 --> 02:50:27.884
DO NOTHING. UNILATERALLY

02:50:27.951 --> 02:50:31.454
SURRENDER. BUT TO ME, THERE ARE

02:50:31.521 --> 02:50:32.956
DEEP MORAL IMPLICATIONS TO THAT

02:50:33.022 --> 02:50:34.190
UNILATERAL SURRENDER. THERE ARE

02:50:34.257 --> 02:50:36.292
REAL IMPACTS TO OUR PEOPLE, TO

02:50:36.359 --> 02:50:38.428
OUR POPULATION, TO OUR PLANET,

02:50:38.494 --> 02:50:40.129
AND TO OUR DEMOCRACY. AND SO

02:50:40.196 --> 02:50:41.798
THERE ARE MANY OF US THAT FEEL

02:50:41.864 --> 02:50:42.966
THAT CALIFORNIA CANNOT STAND

02:50:43.032 --> 02:50:44.300
IDLY BY IN THIS MOMENT, WILL

02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:46.436
NOT STAND IDLY BY IN THIS

02:50:46.502 --> 02:50:48.037
MOMENT. WE OWE IT TO OUR

02:50:48.104 --> 02:50:49.639
CHILDREN TO STAND UP AND BE

02:50:49.706 --> 02:50:51.441
COUNTED. AND SO WHAT DO WE DO

02:50:51.507 --> 02:50:53.076
WHEN WE HAVE THESE TWO

02:50:53.142 --> 02:50:54.577
ARGUMENTS? THOSE WHO SAY

02:50:54.644 --> 02:50:55.478
CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO NOTHING,

02:50:55.545 --> 02:50:57.046
AND THOSE WHO SAY CALIFORNIA

02:50:57.113 --> 02:50:59.248
SHOULD STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK,

02:50:59.315 --> 02:51:01.484
WE DO WHAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY THE

02:51:01.551 --> 02:51:03.186
MOST DEMOCRATIC THING THAT WE

02:51:03.252 --> 02:51:05.121
CAN DO. WE ASK THE PEOPLE OF

02:51:05.188 --> 02:51:06.289
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

02:51:06.356 --> 02:51:08.291
WEIGH IN ON THAT. OUR

02:51:08.358 --> 02:51:08.992
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID HERE AND

02:51:09.058 --> 02:51:10.259
LECTURED US ABOUT WHAT THE

02:51:10.326 --> 02:51:12.195
PEOPLE WANT. THEY HAVE SAT HERE

02:51:12.261 --> 02:51:14.063
AND TOLD US THEY'VE TALKED TO

02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:16.165
US REPEATEDLY ABOUT DEMOCRACY.

02:51:16.232 --> 02:51:17.900
WELL, GOOD. LET'S LET DEMOCRACY

02:51:17.967 --> 02:51:22.271
DECIDE THE WHAT THE THE ONE

02:51:22.338 --> 02:51:23.206
ARGUMENT HERE TO WHICH THEY

02:51:23.272 --> 02:51:25.775
CANNOT REBUT AND WILL NEVER BE

02:51:25.842 --> 02:51:27.043
ABLE TO REBUT, IS THAT THE

02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:28.211
ULTIMATE DECISION HERE RESTS

02:51:28.277 --> 02:51:30.346
WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF

02:51:30.413 --> 02:51:31.147
CALIFORNIA. DONALD TRUMP WILL

02:51:31.214 --> 02:51:33.282
NOT DECIDE THIS. GAVIN NEWSOM

02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:34.517
WILL NOT DECIDE THIS. CONGRESS

02:51:34.584 --> 02:51:36.119
WILL NOT DECIDE THIS. THIS

02:51:36.185 --> 02:51:37.353
LEGISLATURE WILL NOT DECIDE

02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:39.355
THIS. THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:41.357
OF CALIFORNIA WILL GET TO

02:51:41.424 --> 02:51:42.692
DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AT

02:51:42.759 --> 02:51:45.161
THIS PIVOTAL MOMENT IN HISTORY.

02:51:45.228 --> 02:51:47.397
AND THAT, TO ME, IS WHAT MAKES

02:51:47.463 --> 02:51:49.999
THIS THE RIGHT APPROACH. SO WE

02:51:50.066 --> 02:51:51.300
HEARD FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

02:51:51.367 --> 02:51:52.468
WESTMINSTER. HE SAID, LISTEN TO

02:51:52.535 --> 02:51:55.505
THE PEOPLE. I AGREE. LET'S

02:51:55.571 --> 02:51:56.339
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE. LET'S LET

02:51:56.406 --> 02:51:59.075
THE PEOPLE VOTE. LET'S LET THE

02:51:59.142 --> 02:52:00.510
PEOPLE HAVE THEIR MOMENT TO

02:52:00.576 --> 02:52:02.712
MAKE THIS DECISION. THEY HAVE

02:52:02.779 --> 02:52:04.180
THE WISDOM, THEY HAVE THE

02:52:04.247 --> 02:52:06.416
JUDGMENT, AND I AM CONFIDENT

02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:09.218
THAT THEY WILL WANT TO STAND UP

02:52:09.285 --> 02:52:10.353
AND FIGHT BACK TO PROTECT OUR

02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:12.188
DEMOCRACY. AND WITH THAT, AND

02:52:12.255 --> 02:52:14.991
AND IN THE SPIRIT OF GIVING OUR

02:52:15.058 --> 02:52:16.993
CITIZENS AND OUR VOTERS THE

02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:18.227
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THIS

02:52:18.294 --> 02:52:20.029
CONSEQUENTIAL DECISION,

02:52:20.096 --> 02:52:21.130
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN I VOTE

02:52:21.197 --> 02:52:23.366
ON ACR EIGHT. THANK YOU.

02:52:23.433 --> 02:52:25.735

02:52:30.873 --> 02:52:34.944
SPEAKER. MEMBERS AND TO

02:52:35.011 --> 02:52:37.180
EVERYONE WATCHING OUT THERE,

02:52:37.246 --> 02:52:38.848
AMERICANS, INTERNATIONAL

02:52:38.915 --> 02:52:41.851
COMMUNITY, THIS IS NOT A

02:52:41.918 --> 02:52:42.985
REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT OR

02:52:43.052 --> 02:52:45.555
INDEPENDENT ISSUE. THIS IS AN

02:52:45.621 --> 02:52:47.423
AMERICAN ISSUE. PEOPLE HAVE

02:52:47.490 --> 02:52:50.326
DIED. PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED TO

02:52:50.393 --> 02:52:54.964
SAVE DEMOCRACY. I ASSURE YOU

02:52:55.031 --> 02:52:57.500
THAT IF TODAY WE TOOK A VOTE IN

02:52:57.567 --> 02:52:59.702
THIS SAME FLOOR AND THAT BOARD

02:52:59.769 --> 02:53:01.037
THAT WE ALL LIKE TO WATCH THE

02:53:01.104 --> 02:53:02.205
OUTCOMES OF THE VOTES, AND WE

02:53:02.271 --> 02:53:04.941
PUT A VOTE ABOUT THE

02:53:05.007 --> 02:53:06.209
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TAKING

02:53:06.275 --> 02:53:08.377
THEIR ACTION EVERY TEN YEARS,

02:53:08.444 --> 02:53:11.147
IT WOULD BE A UNANIMOUS VOTE,

02:53:11.214 --> 02:53:13.349
BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE THE

02:53:13.416 --> 02:53:15.151
REPUBLICANS, BUT DEMOCRATS HAVE

02:53:15.218 --> 02:53:16.185
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THAT'S THE

02:53:16.252 --> 02:53:18.921
WAY TO GO. I AGREE IT'S THE

02:53:18.988 --> 02:53:19.956
GOLDEN STANDARD THAT CALIFORNIA

02:53:20.022 --> 02:53:22.225
HAS SET FOR THE NATION. AND AS

02:53:22.291 --> 02:53:24.227
I SAY, AS CALIFORNIA GOES, SO

02:53:24.293 --> 02:53:26.395
DOES THE NATION. SO I COULDN'T

02:53:26.462 --> 02:53:29.098
AGREE WITH YOU MORE THAT WE

02:53:29.165 --> 02:53:31.300
HAVE TO PROTECT THAT IN

02:53:31.367 --> 02:53:33.069
CALIFORNIA FOR THE SAKE OF NOT

02:53:33.136 --> 02:53:35.438
ONLY CALIFORNIANS, BUT FOR

02:53:35.505 --> 02:53:37.440
AMERICA. BUT LADIES AND

02:53:37.507 --> 02:53:41.277
GENTLEMEN, AND TO OUR

02:53:41.344 --> 02:53:42.211
COMMUNITIES, OUR LGBT COMMUNITY,

02:53:42.278 --> 02:53:45.248
OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY, WE

02:53:45.314 --> 02:53:48.151
HAVE TO RAISE OUR VOICES FOR

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:49.352
CALIFORNIANS AND FOR AMERICA

02:53:49.418 --> 02:53:53.823
TODAY. NOW, LET'S NOT FORGET

02:53:53.890 --> 02:53:55.024
THAT IN THIS ACTION, THE

02:53:55.091 --> 02:53:56.325
COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE DOING

02:53:56.392 --> 02:53:58.661
THE WORK SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE

02:53:58.728 --> 02:54:00.163
TO TAKE ANY MORE VOTES, THAT

02:54:00.229 --> 02:54:02.231
THEY WILL CONTINUE DOING THE

02:54:02.298 --> 02:54:05.001
WORK AFTER THE 2030 PROCESS.

02:54:05.067 --> 02:54:09.338
THIS IS A TEMPORARY APPROACH TO

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:11.307
REACT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:15.211
OTHER STATES. AND SO I AGREE

02:54:15.278 --> 02:54:18.080
WITH THE MINORITY LEADER. THE

02:54:18.147 --> 02:54:20.283
PRESIDENT IS WRONG ON THIS ONE

02:54:20.349 --> 02:54:22.318
AND TEXAS IS WRONG ON THIS ONE.

02:54:22.385 --> 02:54:24.921
I AGREE WITH HIM WHOLEHEARTEDLY,

02:54:24.987 --> 02:54:28.090
AND THAT'S WHY I AM PROUD, AS I

02:54:28.157 --> 02:54:29.458
HAVE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

02:54:29.525 --> 02:54:30.993
THIS PROCESS, THAT CALIFORNIA

02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:32.962
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ITS

02:54:33.029 --> 02:54:35.398
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION PROCESS.

02:54:35.464 --> 02:54:37.266
BUT YOU SEE, LADIES AND

02:54:37.333 --> 02:54:38.968
GENTLEMEN AND EVERYONE HERE

02:54:39.035 --> 02:54:42.738
TODAY, I WAS SENT TO SACRAMENTO

02:54:42.805 --> 02:54:46.542
TO REPRESENT ALMOST 500,000

02:54:46.609 --> 02:54:47.977
CONSTITUENTS. I PROUDLY

02:54:48.044 --> 02:54:50.379
REPRESENT A HIGH IMMIGRANT

02:54:50.446 --> 02:54:52.248
UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY. CON

02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:53.549
MUCHO CON MUCHO CORAZON. I'M

02:54:53.616 --> 02:54:55.218
HERE REPRESENTING THEM AND

02:54:55.284 --> 02:54:58.120
BEING A VOICE. BECAUSE JUST

02:54:58.187 --> 02:55:00.256
THIS MORNING ON ATLANTIC

02:55:00.323 --> 02:55:02.859
BOULEVARD IN MY CITY OF LYNWOOD

02:55:02.925 --> 02:55:04.026
AT THE BARBERSHOP, THERE'S

02:55:04.093 --> 02:55:07.029
THREE ICE AGENTS TRYING TO

02:55:07.096 --> 02:55:09.799
FORCE THEMSELVES INTO THE

02:55:09.866 --> 02:55:11.100
BARBERSHOP. AND ONCE I'M DONE,

02:55:11.167 --> 02:55:13.836
I WILL HAPPILY, YOU KNOW, DROP

02:55:13.903 --> 02:55:15.972
THAT VIDEO FOR YOU TO WATCH.

02:55:16.038 --> 02:55:17.240
I'LL AIRDROP IT SO YOU CAN ALL

02:55:17.306 --> 02:55:19.976
HAVE. IT HAPPENED THIS MORNING

02:55:20.042 --> 02:55:21.210
IN MY OWN COMMUNITY. THE VERY

02:55:21.277 --> 02:55:23.212
SAME PEOPLE THAT SENT ME TO

02:55:23.279 --> 02:55:25.948
REPRESENT THEM. PEOPLE WHO LOOK

02:55:26.015 --> 02:55:28.150
LIKE ME ARE BEING RACIALLY

02:55:28.217 --> 02:55:30.152
PROFILED AND KIDNAPED ON THE

02:55:30.219 --> 02:55:33.256
STREETS, ON THE WAY TO WORK,

02:55:33.322 --> 02:55:34.423
ACCESSING HEALTH CARE WHILE

02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:36.325
TAKING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL, OR

02:55:36.392 --> 02:55:39.061
EVEN GOING TO CHURCH. HOW

02:55:39.128 --> 02:55:42.098
DISGUSTING IS THAT? IMMIGRANTS

02:55:42.164 --> 02:55:45.434
ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. OUR

02:55:45.501 --> 02:55:47.403
DIVERSITY MAKES OUR STATE AND

02:55:47.470 --> 02:55:49.472
OUR COUNTRY STRONG.

02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:50.172
CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT

02:55:50.239 --> 02:55:52.241
COMMUNITIES ARE VITAL PART OF

02:55:52.308 --> 02:55:54.610
THIS PROSPERITY THROUGH ALL OUR

02:55:54.677 --> 02:55:56.479
NATION. I WILL NOT SIT BACK AND

02:55:56.545 --> 02:55:59.148
WATCH ICE KIDNAP MORE MEMBERS

02:55:59.215 --> 02:56:02.385

02:56:02.451 --> 02:56:06.355
I ASK ALL OF US THAT WE

02:56:06.422 --> 02:56:10.293
TEMPORARILY DO THIS FOR AMERICA.

02:56:10.359 --> 02:56:13.329
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING NOT ONLY

02:56:13.396 --> 02:56:15.398
LOCALLY BUT INTERNATIONALLY,

02:56:15.464 --> 02:56:18.534
AND I BRING NOT ONLY MY HEART,

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:21.203
MY VOICE TODAY TO THIS CAPITAL

02:56:21.270 --> 02:56:23.439
TO ENSURE THAT THE 500,000

02:56:23.506 --> 02:56:25.207

VOICE. I INVITE ALL OF YOU TO

02:56:37.053 --> 02:56:39.455
HELP PROTECT AMERICA. THIS IS

02:56:39.522 --> 02:56:41.290
NOT A REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT OR

02:56:41.357 --> 02:56:43.626
INDEPENDENT ISSUE. LET'S SAVE

02:56:43.693 --> 02:56:46.696
HUMANITY. LET'S SAVE DEMOCRACY.

02:56:46.762 --> 02:56:51.033
AND TEMPORARILY RESPOND TO THIS

02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:52.435
HORRIBLE SITUATION THAT WE'RE

02:56:52.501 --> 02:56:54.971
LIVING. AND THEN CALIFORNIA

02:56:55.037 --> 02:56:56.238
WILL CONTINUE LEADING THE WAY

02:56:56.305 --> 02:56:58.975
BY PROTECTING OUR INDEPENDENT

02:56:59.041 --> 02:57:00.242

LEAVING, WE WELCOME YOU BACK.

02:57:07.483 --> 02:57:09.185

OTHER STATES. WELCOME TO

02:57:10.419 --> 02:57:11.921
CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE GREAT

02:57:11.988 --> 02:57:14.490
BEACHES, GREAT PARKS, AND OF

02:57:14.557 --> 02:57:16.592
COURSE, SOME OF THE BEST

02:57:16.659 --> 02:57:17.927
RESTAURANTS THAT OUR COMMUNITY

02:57:17.994 --> 02:57:21.097

UP ON THIS UNIQUE OFFER TO TALK

02:57:35.344 --> 02:57:37.079
ABOUT POLITICAL PARTIES. IT'S

02:57:37.146 --> 02:57:39.315
NOT SOMETHING I LIKE TO DO, BUT

02:57:39.382 --> 02:57:40.549
SOME OF THESE COMMENTS LIKE

02:57:40.616 --> 02:57:42.118
QUOTE UNQUOTE, DROPPING TO THE

02:57:42.184 --> 02:57:43.486
KNEES OF THE PRESIDENT, WHAT

02:57:43.552 --> 02:57:45.021
DOES THAT MEAN? I TAKE OFFENSE

02:57:45.087 --> 02:57:48.557
TO THAT. MY GRANDPA USED TO SAY

02:57:48.624 --> 02:57:49.492
WHEN SOMETHING MIRACULOUS

02:57:49.558 --> 02:57:51.594
HAPPENED, NOT BAD FOR SWIRLING

02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:54.296
GASES. WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS

02:57:54.363 --> 02:57:56.165
MOCKING EVOLUTION. PIPER WASN'T

02:57:56.232 --> 02:57:58.701
AN OVERLY RELIGIOUS MAN. HE

02:57:58.768 --> 02:58:00.436
LOVED GOD, AND HE LOVED OUR

02:58:00.503 --> 02:58:01.737
NATION, ESPECIALLY AS HE

02:58:01.804 --> 02:58:03.272
DEFENDED IT IN THE MILITARY FOR

02:58:03.339 --> 02:58:06.142
HIS ENTIRE CAREER. HE WAS A MAN

02:58:06.208 --> 02:58:08.044
THAT BELIEVED IN A HIGHER POWER.

02:58:08.110 --> 02:58:11.647
HE BELIEVED THERE WERE NO

02:58:11.714 --> 02:58:12.615
COINCIDENCES. THESE MIRACLES

02:58:12.681 --> 02:58:15.084
WERE DIVINE DESPITE THOUSANDS

02:58:15.151 --> 02:58:17.720
AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF

02:58:17.787 --> 02:58:18.254
AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS,

02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:20.790
KINGS, DICTATORS. IT WASN'T

02:58:20.856 --> 02:58:23.025
SWIRLING GASES THAT CREATED OUR

02:58:23.092 --> 02:58:24.260
FORM OF GOVERNMENT, AND OUR

02:58:24.326 --> 02:58:26.362
FOUNDERS SAID AS MUCH WHEN THEY

02:58:26.429 --> 02:58:27.196
DECLARED US AN INDEPENDENT

02:58:27.263 --> 02:58:29.165
NATION. THE DECLARATION OF OUR

02:58:29.231 --> 02:58:30.599
INDEPENDENCE PROCLAIMS, THE

02:58:30.666 --> 02:58:32.168
PEOPLE ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR

02:58:32.234 --> 02:58:34.570
CREATOR AND OUR ALIENABLE

02:58:34.637 --> 02:58:36.372
INALIENABLE RIGHTS WHICH ARE

02:58:36.439 --> 02:58:38.307
NOT GRANTED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

02:58:38.374 --> 02:58:40.009
THEY ARE INHERENTLY BESTOWED

02:58:40.076 --> 02:58:43.279
UPON US, I BELIEVE, AS THE

02:58:43.345 --> 02:58:44.080
FOUNDERS DID IN DIVINE

02:58:44.146 --> 02:58:46.148
PROVIDENCE, MEANING THAT I

02:58:46.215 --> 02:58:48.918
FIRMLY BELIEVE ANY INTERNAL

02:58:48.984 --> 02:58:50.453
THREATS TO OUR DEMOCRACY,

02:58:50.519 --> 02:58:51.420
WHETHER FROM THE NATIONAL LEVEL

02:58:51.487 --> 02:58:53.055
OR RIGHT HERE IN THE CHAMBERS

02:58:53.122 --> 02:58:55.424
OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:58:55.491 --> 02:58:57.993
ASSEMBLY, THAT WE WILL BE OKAY.

02:58:58.060 --> 02:58:59.195
THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE WILL

02:58:59.261 --> 02:59:01.597
SECURE INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO

02:59:01.664 --> 02:59:03.566
SELF-DETERMINATION. AND DESPITE

02:59:03.632 --> 02:59:05.568
ATTEMPTS BY THIS BODY OR

02:59:05.634 --> 02:59:06.502
ATTEMPTS BY THE GOVERNOR FROM

02:59:06.569 --> 02:59:08.270
THE MOMENT HE WENT UNCHALLENGED

02:59:08.337 --> 02:59:11.006
BY MEMBERS ON THIS FLOOR, WHEN

02:59:11.073 --> 02:59:13.609
HE EXERTED SO MUCH POWER WITH

02:59:13.676 --> 02:59:15.478
NO DEMOCRATIC INPUT. WHAT DID

02:59:15.544 --> 02:59:18.080
YOU DO? MENTION ME SITTING BY

02:59:18.147 --> 02:59:21.684
IDLY, YOU SAT IDLY BY AND HE

02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:22.418
CHOSE TO CLOSE SCHOOLS. HE

02:59:22.485 --> 02:59:25.054
CLOSED BUSINESSES AND AT LEAST

02:59:25.121 --> 02:59:27.523
PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:29.592
PAIN AND SUFFERING YOU SEE IN

02:59:29.658 --> 02:59:30.659
OUR STREETS. AND WE CONTINUE TO

02:59:30.726 --> 02:59:34.063
SEE TO THIS DAY. AND GUESS WHAT?

02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:35.664
TO ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:59:35.731 --> 02:59:36.599
LOS ANGELES ABOUT REPUBLICANS

02:59:36.665 --> 02:59:40.136
IN THIS BODY THAT'S IDLY BY. I

02:59:40.202 --> 02:59:41.337
TAKE GREAT OFFENSE TO THAT KIND

02:59:41.403 --> 02:59:44.039
OF STUFF. MR. SPEAKER, WHEN

02:59:44.106 --> 02:59:45.141
SOMEONE TALKS ABOUT WHAT

02:59:45.207 --> 02:59:46.809
REPUBLICANS HERE HAVE AND

02:59:46.876 --> 02:59:49.445
HAVEN'T DONE, PLEASE, DEMOCRATS

02:59:49.512 --> 02:59:50.746
HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE OF THIS

02:59:50.813 --> 02:59:53.949
STATE FOR MY ENTIRE NATURAL

02:59:54.016 --> 02:59:57.153
LIFE. I KNOW AS INDIVIDUAL

02:59:57.219 --> 02:59:58.320
LEGISLATORS, SOME OF YOU HAVE

02:59:58.387 --> 03:00:01.023
TRIED, BUT YOU GOING TO TALK

03:00:01.090 --> 03:00:03.292
ABOUT SITTING IDLY BY, AS THEY

03:00:03.359 --> 03:00:07.263
SAY ON X LOL. DEMOCRATS MAYBE

03:00:07.329 --> 03:00:09.431
NOT AS INDIVIDUALS, BUT AS A

03:00:09.498 --> 03:00:11.600
RULING DICTATOR PARTY OF THIS

03:00:11.667 --> 03:00:14.403
STATE FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE ARE

03:00:14.470 --> 03:00:16.172
SITTING, SITTING IDLY BY AND

03:00:16.238 --> 03:00:18.374
HAVE EFFECTIVELY DONE NOTHING

03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:21.143
THAT HAS RESULTED IN A BETTER

03:00:21.210 --> 03:00:22.678
EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN, HAS

03:00:22.745 --> 03:00:24.046
DONE NOTHING TO EFFECTIVELY

03:00:24.113 --> 03:00:26.248
ADDRESS THE PEOPLE LAYING IN

03:00:26.315 --> 03:00:28.284
OUR STREET JUST BLOCKS FROM

03:00:28.350 --> 03:00:30.152
THIS BUILDING. THESE THINGS

03:00:30.219 --> 03:00:31.320
HAVE GOTTEN WORSE, ESPECIALLY

03:00:31.387 --> 03:00:33.656
SINCE DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN FULL

03:00:33.722 --> 03:00:36.392
CONTROL OF EVERY LEVER OF OUR

03:00:36.458 --> 03:00:38.727
GOVERNMENT RIGHT HERE IN

03:00:38.794 --> 03:00:40.429
CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE IN

03:00:40.496 --> 03:00:42.131
DEMOCRACY. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S

03:00:42.198 --> 03:00:44.500
ROOTED IN OUR FUNDAMENTAL,

03:00:44.567 --> 03:00:45.501
INALIENABLE RIGHT TO BE FREE.

03:00:45.568 --> 03:00:47.203
AND YOU CANNOT TAKE THAT AWAY.

03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:48.871
AND NEITHER CAN GAVIN NEWSOM.

03:00:48.938 --> 03:00:51.473
WHAT THIS BODY IS LIKELY TO DO

03:00:51.540 --> 03:00:52.474
IN A FEW MINUTES HIGHLIGHTS THE

03:00:52.541 --> 03:00:54.143
FLAWS OF MAN. MANY OF YOU WILL

03:00:54.210 --> 03:00:56.245
VOTE NOT TO TURN THE OTHER

03:00:56.312 --> 03:00:57.446
CHEEK. YOU WILL VOTE UNDER YOUR

03:00:57.513 --> 03:00:58.981
OWN ADMISSION TO FIGHT BACK, TO

03:00:59.048 --> 03:01:01.150
PUNCH BACK, TO FIGHT FIRE WITH

03:01:01.217 --> 03:01:02.418
FIRE. I BELIEVE AT THE END OF

03:01:02.484 --> 03:01:04.186
THE DAY, DESPITE YOUR BEST

03:01:04.253 --> 03:01:05.187
EFFORTS TO PARTICIPATE AND

03:01:05.254 --> 03:01:06.956
ATTEMPT TO ERODE DEMOCRACY, WE

03:01:07.022 --> 03:01:09.758
WILL BE FINE. WHEN HISTORY

03:01:09.825 --> 03:01:11.260
LOOKS BACK. CALIFORNIA WILL NOT

03:01:11.327 --> 03:01:14.263
SUCCEED IN ITS MUTUAL GOAL OF

03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:16.232
JOINING WITH ENTRENCHED

03:01:16.298 --> 03:01:17.466
PARTIZAN DEMOCRATS THROUGHOUT

03:01:17.533 --> 03:01:19.635
OUR NATION TO THROW OUT

03:01:19.702 --> 03:01:21.403
DEMOCRACY IN ITS FIGHT FOR FIRE

03:01:21.470 --> 03:01:24.506
WITH FIRE, BECAUSE IT CANNOT

03:01:24.573 --> 03:01:25.241
OVERRIDE THE FUNDAMENTAL

03:01:25.307 --> 03:01:26.542
PROTECTIONS OUR FOUNDING

03:01:26.609 --> 03:01:28.377
DOCUMENTS GUARANTEE. US HISTORY

03:01:28.444 --> 03:01:29.979
WILL NOT LOOK PROUDLY ON THIS

03:01:30.045 --> 03:01:32.615
MOMENT. IT WILL LOOK HIGHLY ON

03:01:32.681 --> 03:01:35.517
POTENTIAL CHANGES TO ANY MAP IN

03:01:35.584 --> 03:01:37.886
THIS STATE. IT'S GOING TO BE

03:01:37.953 --> 03:01:39.154
FROWNED UPON, AND IT CERTAINLY

03:01:39.221 --> 03:01:41.390
WON'T LOOK HIGHLY ON THE

03:01:41.457 --> 03:01:42.524
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERED MAPS

03:01:42.591 --> 03:01:45.127
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THOSE

03:01:45.194 --> 03:01:47.229
ARE THE WORDS FROM ONE OF THE

03:01:47.296 --> 03:01:49.732
COAUTHORS IN COMMITTEE OF THIS

03:01:49.798 --> 03:01:53.102
MEASURE. I DON'T EVER WANT TO

03:01:53.168 --> 03:01:55.037
BE LECTURED EVER AGAIN BY

03:01:55.104 --> 03:01:56.939
DEMOCRAT ANYWHERE THAT THEIR

03:01:57.006 --> 03:01:57.940
PARTY IS THE PARTY OF DEMOCRACY.

03:01:58.007 --> 03:02:00.542
30S WHAT YOU'RE DOING, EVEN BY

03:02:00.609 --> 03:02:01.477
AMENDING THIS PROPOSAL THIS

03:02:01.543 --> 03:02:04.146
MORNING WITHOUT ANY INPUT IS

03:02:04.213 --> 03:02:05.748
SHOWING YOU ARE NO BETTER.

03:02:05.814 --> 03:02:08.050
DEMOCRACY IS FLAWED. MANKIND IS

03:02:08.117 --> 03:02:09.318
FLAWED, THE MEASURE IS FLAWED

03:02:09.385 --> 03:02:11.186
AND YOU KNOW IT. HOW MANY

03:02:11.253 --> 03:02:12.755
PEOPLE IN THIS BODY TESTIFIED

03:02:12.821 --> 03:02:14.390
BY TEXAS? THE PUBLIC GOT TO

03:02:14.456 --> 03:02:17.226
KNOW THAT YOU STRUCK OUT THE

03:02:17.293 --> 03:02:18.460
LANGUAGE THIS MORNING. I DIDN'T

03:02:18.527 --> 03:02:20.729
EVEN KNOW UNTIL I WALKED IN THE

03:02:20.796 --> 03:02:21.297
BUILDING TO EVEN TALK ABOUT

03:02:21.363 --> 03:02:23.265
TEXAS. NO MATTER WHAT TEXAS

03:02:23.332 --> 03:02:24.566
DOES, IF THEY DO NOTHING, YOU

03:02:24.633 --> 03:02:27.303
ARE ASKING THE PEOPLE TO ERODE

03:02:27.369 --> 03:02:28.470
THEIR RIGHTS. THANK YOU,

03:02:28.537 --> 03:02:30.239
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LET ME. I ASK

03:02:32.308 --> 03:02:34.109
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. PATTERSON.

03:02:34.176 --> 03:02:35.110

03:02:43.118 --> 03:02:45.487
PEOPLE WILL SAVE THEIR

03:02:45.554 --> 03:02:46.088
GOVERNMENT IF THE GOVERNMENT

03:02:46.155 --> 03:02:49.458
ITSELF WILL ALLOW THEM. YOU

03:02:49.525 --> 03:02:50.359
KNOW, I'VE THOUGHT AS I'VE SAT

03:02:50.426 --> 03:02:52.161
HERE, I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL

03:02:52.227 --> 03:02:54.530
MENTION TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM

03:02:54.596 --> 03:02:55.964
LANCASTER, SORRY, FROM PALMDALE.

03:02:56.031 --> 03:02:57.633
I APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENTS AT

03:02:57.700 --> 03:02:59.301
THE BEGINNING, SIR. I DIDN'T

03:02:59.368 --> 03:03:01.170
RAISE MY MIC RIGHT AWAY. I

03:03:01.236 --> 03:03:02.237
WANTED TO LISTEN. I WANTED TO

03:03:02.304 --> 03:03:03.339
LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES

03:03:03.405 --> 03:03:05.474
SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF ACR EIGHT.

03:03:05.541 --> 03:03:06.175
I WANTED TO LISTEN TO SOME OF

03:03:06.241 --> 03:03:08.243
YOU WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ACR

03:03:08.310 --> 03:03:10.546
EIGHT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR

03:03:10.612 --> 03:03:11.113
ESTEEMED MINORITY LEADER. WE

03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:12.314
DON'T AGREE ON MUCH, BUT I

03:03:12.381 --> 03:03:13.949
APPRECIATE YOUR WORDS TODAY,

03:03:14.016 --> 03:03:16.218
SIR. THE PRESIDENT IS WRONG. HE

03:03:16.285 --> 03:03:17.453
IS WRONG TO BE DOING WHAT HE'S

03:03:17.519 --> 03:03:19.221
DOING. AND YOUR POINT ABOUT TWO

03:03:19.288 --> 03:03:21.023
WRONGS NOT MAKING A RIGHT AND

03:03:21.090 --> 03:03:21.990
BURNING THE ENTIRE HOUSE DOWN?

03:03:22.057 --> 03:03:24.159
THERE'S A LOT OF TRUTH IN THAT

03:03:24.226 --> 03:03:25.527
STATEMENT. I AGREE WITH YOU,

03:03:25.594 --> 03:03:27.162
SIR. AND YET, OVER THE LAST

03:03:27.229 --> 03:03:29.031
WEEK I'VE STRUGGLED WITH THIS

03:03:29.098 --> 03:03:30.132
ISSUE. I HAVE CONSULTED THE

03:03:30.199 --> 03:03:32.267
GOOD BOOK. I'VE SPENT TIME IN

03:03:32.334 --> 03:03:33.102
THOUGHT AND PRAYER AT THE

03:03:33.168 --> 03:03:34.269
CATHEDRAL. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO

03:03:34.336 --> 03:03:36.305
FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER ON THIS

03:03:36.372 --> 03:03:37.139
ISSUE. AND THE REMARKABLE THING

03:03:37.206 --> 03:03:39.208
IS, IS I SAT HERE ON THIS FLOOR

03:03:39.274 --> 03:03:40.442
LISTENING AND REALLY GIVING

03:03:40.509 --> 03:03:41.543
THOUGHT TO WHAT WE'RE BEING

03:03:41.610 --> 03:03:43.245
ASKED TO DO. IT WAS THIS

03:03:43.312 --> 03:03:45.180
PORTRAIT THAT HANGS ABOVE US

03:03:45.247 --> 03:03:46.348
THAT REALLY CENTERED MY

03:03:46.415 --> 03:03:48.584
THOUGHTS. THE PEOPLE WILL SAVE

03:03:48.650 --> 03:03:50.052
THE GOVERNMENT. THEY WILL SAVE

03:03:50.119 --> 03:03:51.253
THEMSELVES IF THE GOVERNMENT

03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:53.188
SIMPLY ALLOWS THEM TO DO SO.

03:03:53.255 --> 03:03:54.456
THE WORDS OF PROBABLY ONE OF

03:03:54.523 --> 03:03:55.290
THE GREATEST PRESIDENTS WE EVER

03:03:55.357 --> 03:03:57.493
HAD, A PORTRAIT THAT HANGS OVER

03:03:57.559 --> 03:03:58.994
OUR CHAMBER. A MAN WHO HAS

03:03:59.061 --> 03:04:01.363
GENERAL ORDER 141 HAD TO

03:04:01.430 --> 03:04:03.632
SUSPEND HABEAS CORPUS AND TAKE

03:04:03.699 --> 03:04:04.266
UNPRECEDENTED ACTION BECAUSE OF

03:04:04.333 --> 03:04:06.201
THE RISKS THAT FACE THE

03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:07.436
REPUBLIC IN AN UNPRECEDENTED

03:04:07.503 --> 03:04:10.139
TIME. WE'RE ABSOLUTELY IN

03:04:10.205 --> 03:04:12.408
UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. I BRING

03:04:12.474 --> 03:04:14.510
ALL THIS UP TO SAY THAT I'M NOT

03:04:14.576 --> 03:04:15.477
HERE TO STAND WITH RIGHTEOUS

03:04:15.544 --> 03:04:17.279
INDIGNATION. I'M NOT HERE TO

03:04:17.346 --> 03:04:18.147
POINT FINGERS AT ANY OF YOU.

03:04:18.213 --> 03:04:20.616
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE HOUSE

03:04:20.682 --> 03:04:21.984
IS BURNING. DEMOCRACY IS AT

03:04:22.050 --> 03:04:23.652
RISK. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN

03:04:23.719 --> 03:04:25.354
TEXAS, WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:27.322
THE COUNTRY IS FUNDAMENTALLY

03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:29.158
WRONG. I DON'T BELIEVE THE

03:04:29.224 --> 03:04:31.326
ANSWER TO HOW WE SAVE DEMOCRACY

03:04:31.393 --> 03:04:33.595
CAN BE DECIDED AMONG THE 119

03:04:33.662 --> 03:04:34.830
LEGISLATORS IN OUR STATE

03:04:34.897 --> 03:04:36.064
CAPITAL. I DON'T BELIEVE THE

03:04:36.131 --> 03:04:37.266
GOVERNOR ALONE CAN MAKE THAT

03:04:37.332 --> 03:04:39.268
ANSWER. WHAT I DO BELIEVE,

03:04:39.334 --> 03:04:41.403
THOUGH, IS WE HAVE TO GIVE THE

03:04:41.470 --> 03:04:43.338
PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO WEIGH IN

03:04:43.405 --> 03:04:45.607
ON THIS MATTER. AND THAT IS

03:04:45.674 --> 03:04:47.242
EXACTLY WHAT ACA DOES. I

03:04:47.309 --> 03:04:48.444
BELIEVE THAT THIS QUESTION

03:04:48.510 --> 03:04:50.145
SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE

03:04:50.212 --> 03:04:51.480
PEOPLE, AND I'LL SIMPLY CLOSE

03:04:51.547 --> 03:04:52.981
WITH ONE POINT. NEVER IN THE

03:04:53.048 --> 03:04:54.116
COURSE OF HISTORY IN THE STATE

03:04:54.183 --> 03:04:56.218
OF CALIFORNIA OR IN ANY STATE,

03:04:56.285 --> 03:04:57.052
HAVE THE PEOPLE BEEN DIRECTLY

03:04:57.119 --> 03:04:58.120
GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON

03:04:58.187 --> 03:05:01.323
A MAP. I BELIEVE THAT IS

03:05:01.390 --> 03:05:03.692
DEMOCRACY IN ITS FINEST HOUR.

03:05:03.759 --> 03:05:05.227
LET THE PEOPLE RESPOND AND TELL

03:05:05.294 --> 03:05:06.562
US HOW WE SHOULD FIGHT TO

03:05:06.628 --> 03:05:08.363
CONTINUE SAVING DEMOCRACY. I

03:05:08.430 --> 03:05:10.132
WILL BE VOTING AYE, AND I

03:05:10.199 --> 03:05:11.166
ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO VOTE AYE

03:05:11.233 --> 03:05:13.335
ON ACR EIGHT. THANK YOU, MR.

03:05:13.402 --> 03:05:14.536

THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I

WANTED TO MENTION THAT I'M A

03:05:28.283 --> 03:05:30.052
PROUD CO-SPONSOR OF ACR EIGHT.

03:05:30.118 --> 03:05:31.286
SO WHEN THE OPPOSITION

03:05:31.353 --> 03:05:33.188
CONTINUES THEIR UNSERIOUS

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:34.323
LAWSUITS, THEY KNOW WHO TO

03:05:34.389 --> 03:05:36.925
DIRECT THEM TOWARDS. I RISE IN

03:05:44.466 --> 03:05:46.869
DECISIVE ACTION TO STAND UP TO

03:05:46.935 --> 03:05:48.604
DONALD TRUMP'S UNPRECEDENTED

03:05:48.670 --> 03:05:50.339

03:11:27.442 --> 03:11:29.110
IT'S BEEN VERY LOUD. WHERE WAS

03:11:29.177 --> 03:11:31.079
ALL OF THE NOISE WHEN THE

03:11:31.146 --> 03:11:32.347
PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS SLASHED

03:11:32.414 --> 03:11:35.083
FEDERAL FUNDING, CUT MEDICAID,

03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:37.819
IMPOSED TARIFFS THAT HURT SMALL

03:11:37.886 --> 03:11:40.121
BUSINESSES? WHERE WAS THE NOISE?

03:11:40.188 --> 03:11:41.823
THERE HAS BEEN COMPLICITY AS

03:11:41.890 --> 03:11:43.658
THE CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN

03:11:43.725 --> 03:11:46.228
UNDERMINED AS PARTIZAN

03:11:46.294 --> 03:11:47.696
GERRYMANDERING MAPS HAVE BEEN

03:11:47.762 --> 03:11:50.098
PUSHED ON THE PEOPLE IN TEXAS,

03:11:50.165 --> 03:11:51.433
WHICH ULTIMATELY AFFECTS THE

03:11:51.499 --> 03:11:54.502
ENTIRE UNITED STATES. WHERE WAS

03:11:54.569 --> 03:11:57.038
ALL THE NOISE WHILE AMERICA WAS

03:11:57.105 --> 03:12:00.976
BEING? TODAY, WITH ALL OF THE

03:12:01.042 --> 03:12:02.811
OBJECTIONS AND WITH ALL OF THE

03:12:02.878 --> 03:12:05.547
NOISE, I AM CLEARLY CONCERNED

03:12:05.614 --> 03:12:08.817
THAT IT IS OUR JOB TO STAND UP

03:12:08.884 --> 03:12:10.051
AND TO SPEAK OUT. WE MUST ASK,

03:12:10.118 --> 03:12:12.220
CAN YOU TELL US, PLEASE? WHAT I

03:12:12.287 --> 03:12:14.589
HAVE NOT HEARD IS WHY ARE WE SO

03:12:14.656 --> 03:12:17.292
AFRAID TO GIVE THE VOTERS A

03:12:17.359 --> 03:12:18.226
CHOICE? WHAT ARE WE SO AFRAID

03:12:18.293 --> 03:12:21.429
OF? AND WE SHOULD ALSO ASK,

03:12:21.496 --> 03:12:23.164
WITH ALL THE TEARS, TO PROTECT

03:12:23.231 --> 03:12:24.266
THE PRESIDENT'S GERRYMANDERING

03:12:24.332 --> 03:12:27.135
PLAN. WHERE WERE ALL THE TEARS

03:12:27.202 --> 03:12:29.771
FOR THE POOR PEOPLE? THE PEOPLE

03:12:29.838 --> 03:12:31.706
WHO HAVE BEEN SILENCED? PEOPLE

03:12:31.773 --> 03:12:34.042
ARE SUFFERING AND DYING BECAUSE

03:12:34.109 --> 03:12:36.878
WE NEED TO LEAD. PEOPLE ARE NOT

03:12:36.945 --> 03:12:39.114
LEADING AND THAT HURTS AMERICA.

03:12:39.180 --> 03:12:41.950
SO WE HAVE A VOICE AND WE HAVE

03:12:42.017 --> 03:12:44.953
A CHOICE. DO WE DENY THE

03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:47.022
CITIZENS A CHANCE TO HAVE

03:12:47.088 --> 03:12:48.657
DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, FREE AND

03:12:48.723 --> 03:12:50.125
FAIR ELECTIONS AND LIBERTY AND

03:12:50.191 --> 03:12:52.294
JUSTICE FOR ALL? LIKE WE SAY,

03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:54.629
WHEN WE STAND UP AND WE PLEDGE

03:12:54.696 --> 03:12:55.497
ALLEGIANCE TO THIS SAME FLAG

03:12:55.563 --> 03:12:58.600
WHEN WE COME INTO THIS CHAMBER.

03:12:58.667 --> 03:13:00.135
THIS IS ABOUT CITIZENS THAT ARE

03:13:00.201 --> 03:13:02.304
BEING TERRORIZED. WHEN THOSE

03:13:02.370 --> 03:13:05.106
WHO ARE BEING BULLIED NEED

03:13:05.173 --> 03:13:06.341
SOMEONE TO STAND UP. CALIFORNIA

03:13:06.408 --> 03:13:09.010
IS NOT GOING TO SIT DOWN AND BE

03:13:09.077 --> 03:13:11.212
A BYSTANDER. IF YOU WANT TO BE

03:13:11.279 --> 03:13:13.048
TAKEN SERIOUSLY, YOU NEED TO BE

03:13:13.114 --> 03:13:15.116
ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO US WHY YOU

03:13:15.183 --> 03:13:16.117
DON'T WANT TO GIVE THIS TO THE

03:13:16.184 --> 03:13:18.053
VOTERS. THE RULES HAVE BEEN

03:13:18.119 --> 03:13:20.255
CHANGED AND THAT MEANS WE HAVE

03:13:20.322 --> 03:13:22.090
TO ACT ACCORDINGLY. WE HAVE A

03:13:22.157 --> 03:13:24.960
CHOICE. DO WE WANT TO ALLOW THE

03:13:25.026 --> 03:13:27.028
ENTIRE NATION TO BE

03:13:27.095 --> 03:13:28.596
DISENFRANCHIZED, OR DO WE ASK

03:13:28.663 --> 03:13:30.498
THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA TO

03:13:30.565 --> 03:13:32.200
LOCK ARMS WITH US AND TO MARCH

03:13:32.267 --> 03:13:35.537
FORWARD TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IN

03:13:35.603 --> 03:13:37.238
THE WORLD, WHERE THE US HAS NOW

03:13:37.305 --> 03:13:38.740
BECOME AN AUTHORITARIAN

03:13:38.807 --> 03:13:41.309
GOVERNMENT AND HAS ADOPTED THE

03:13:41.376 --> 03:13:43.178
STRATEGIES OF DICTATORS TO RIG

03:13:43.244 --> 03:13:45.113
A SYSTEM, I SAY THAT IT'S OUR

03:13:45.180 --> 03:13:47.415
DUTY TO GIVE IT TO THE VOTERS

03:13:47.482 --> 03:13:49.117
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO

03:13:49.184 --> 03:13:51.319
FIGHT BACK ON BEHALF OF THE

03:13:51.386 --> 03:13:53.521
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES.

03:13:53.588 --> 03:13:55.423
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

03:13:55.490 --> 03:13:56.358

COAUTHOR OF ACA EIGHT. FOR

03:14:09.237 --> 03:14:11.306
YEARS, TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION

03:14:11.373 --> 03:14:13.041

THAT ARE BY CUTTING SNAP

03:14:21.316 --> 03:14:22.784
BENEFITS, TERRORIZING IMMIGRANT

03:14:22.851 --> 03:14:24.386

KIDNAPING OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS,

03:14:29.624 --> 03:14:31.159
IMPOSING TARIFFS THAT HAVE

03:14:31.226 --> 03:14:33.928
PUNISHED THE WORKING FAMILIES.

03:14:33.995 --> 03:14:36.231
AND NOW TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES,

03:14:36.297 --> 03:14:38.967
HIS DOMESTIC TERRORISTS, ARE

03:14:39.034 --> 03:14:41.536
TRYING TO DISMANTLE DEMOCRACY.

03:14:41.603 --> 03:14:43.405
WITH CALIFORNIA'S REDISTRICTING

03:14:43.471 --> 03:14:45.106
PROPOSAL. WE'RE NOT RACING TO

03:14:45.173 --> 03:14:46.941
THE BOTTOM. WE'RE DRAWING THE

03:14:47.008 --> 03:14:50.178
LINE. WHILE REPUBLICAN LED

03:14:50.245 --> 03:14:51.312

REDISTRICTING, NOT PARTIZAN

03:14:59.554 --> 03:15:02.157
POWER GRABS. FOR THOSE WHO KNOW

03:15:02.223 --> 03:15:04.926
ME, I HAVE DEDICATED MUCH OF MY

COMMUNITIES ENJOY A VOICE AT

03:15:11.166 --> 03:15:13.334
THE TABLE. EVERY STATE SHOULD

03:15:13.401 --> 03:15:14.135
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

03:15:14.202 --> 03:15:16.638

STILL DO. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR

03:15:22.210 --> 03:15:23.411
WE'RE ALSO DEFENDING AGAINST A

03:15:23.478 --> 03:15:25.113
COORDINATING POWER GRAB. THIS

03:15:25.180 --> 03:15:27.048
ISN'T POLITICS AS USUAL. THIS

03:15:27.115 --> 03:15:30.518
IS AN EMERGENCY. THIS IS AN

03:15:30.585 --> 03:15:31.619
EMERGENCY FOR OUR STATE. THIS

03:15:31.686 --> 03:15:33.054

OUR DEMOCRACY. CALIFORNIA WILL

03:15:37.392 --> 03:15:39.627
ALWAYS DEFEND THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

03:15:39.694 --> 03:15:41.996
AND WE WILL AND THE WILL OF THE

03:15:42.063 --> 03:15:44.299
PEOPLE. UNLIKE TEXAS, WE WON'T

03:15:51.072 --> 03:15:54.242
CALIFORNIA VOTERS WILL SEE MAPS.

03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:56.478
CALIFORNIA VOTERS WILL DECIDE.

03:15:56.544 --> 03:15:58.313
CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BACK DOWN.

03:15:58.379 --> 03:16:00.415
WE WILL PROTECT OUR VOTE, OUR

03:16:00.482 --> 03:16:04.285

03:16:14.829 --> 03:16:15.997

HARD OR CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY

03:16:52.967 --> 03:16:56.437

03:19:13.274 --> 03:19:16.444
WHAT IS BEST. WILL I BELIEVE

03:19:16.511 --> 03:19:18.279
THAT THEIR VOICES MATTER, I

03:19:18.346 --> 03:19:20.615
HEAR. LISTEN. LISTEN TO THE

03:19:20.682 --> 03:19:22.283
PEOPLE. WELL, THAT'S WHAT I DO.

03:19:22.350 --> 03:19:24.252
I LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE. IT'S

03:19:24.319 --> 03:19:26.487
NOT MY AGENDA. IT'S THEIR

03:19:26.554 --> 03:19:29.090
AGENDA. THROUGH LCMS, I SENT

03:19:29.157 --> 03:19:31.626
OUT A FIVE QUESTION POLL. MY

03:19:31.693 --> 03:19:33.027
DISTRICT IS THE MOST PURPLE AND

03:19:33.094 --> 03:19:35.296
BALANCED DISTRICT IN THE STATE.

03:19:35.363 --> 03:19:37.799
SO YOU SHOULD BE ALL INTERESTED

03:19:37.865 --> 03:19:39.167
IN THESE RESULTS. THE FIRST

03:19:39.233 --> 03:19:42.337

03:19:42.403 --> 03:19:43.104

03:19:43.171 --> 03:19:44.605
INDEPENDENT CITIZENS

03:19:44.672 --> 03:19:46.641
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION THAT

03:19:46.708 --> 03:19:48.543
DRAWS ELECTION DISTRICT MAPS.

03:19:48.609 --> 03:19:49.811
DO YOU THINK REDISTRICTING

03:19:49.877 --> 03:19:51.346
SHOULD BE DONE BY AN

03:19:51.412 --> 03:19:53.614
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION, THE

03:19:53.681 --> 03:19:56.117
LEGISLATURE, OR UNSURE? THESE

03:19:56.184 --> 03:19:59.320

03:19:59.387 --> 03:20:01.322
OF DEMOCRATS FAVORED AN

03:20:01.389 --> 03:20:04.959
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. 96% OF

REPUBLICANS FAVORED AN

03:20:06.527 --> 03:20:09.530
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION, AND 92%

03:20:09.597 --> 03:20:11.065
OF INDEPENDENTS FAVORED AN

03:20:11.132 --> 03:20:13.267
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. THE

03:20:13.334 --> 03:20:15.002
SECOND QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED

03:20:15.069 --> 03:20:18.005
STATED, HOW IMPORTANT IS IT

03:20:18.072 --> 03:20:21.209
THAT REDISTRICTING DIVISION BE

03:20:21.275 --> 03:20:22.610
MADE THROUGH A PROCESS THAT IS

03:20:22.677 --> 03:20:24.445
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND ALLOWS

03:20:24.512 --> 03:20:28.049
FOR COMMUNITY INPUT? 78% OF

03:20:28.116 --> 03:20:31.586
DEMOCRATS SAID VERY IMPORTANT,

03:20:31.652 --> 03:20:33.121
97% OF REPUBLICANS SAID VERY

03:20:33.187 --> 03:20:35.957
IMPORTANT, AND 96% OF

03:20:36.023 --> 03:20:37.592
INDEPENDENTS SAID VERY

03:20:37.658 --> 03:20:39.460
IMPORTANT. AT THE BEGINNING OF

03:20:39.527 --> 03:20:41.462
THIS YEAR IN SESSION, IT WAS

03:20:41.529 --> 03:20:43.197
VERY CLEAR WHAT THE CONCERNS OF

03:20:43.264 --> 03:20:45.199
CALIFORNIANS WERE AND WHAT THEY

03:20:45.266 --> 03:20:47.135
NEEDED FROM THIS LEGISLATURE. I

03:20:47.201 --> 03:20:48.436
THINK EVERYONE AGREED THE

03:20:48.503 --> 03:20:50.104
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND

03:20:50.171 --> 03:20:52.206
WHAT'S WRONG, AND IN MY

03:20:52.273 --> 03:20:53.708
DISTRICT THEY HAVE RESPONDED

03:20:53.775 --> 03:20:55.176
AND TOLD ME, MR. SPEAKER,

03:20:55.243 --> 03:20:57.745
QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT

03:20:57.812 --> 03:20:59.147
OBJECTION, YOUR TIME IS ABOUT

03:20:59.213 --> 03:21:02.517
TO ELAPSE. JUST TO FINISH UP

03:21:02.583 --> 03:21:04.085
HERE, MY FINAL QUESTION TO THE

03:21:04.152 --> 03:21:06.354
AUTHOR IS DID YOU OR DO YOU

03:21:06.421 --> 03:21:08.389
KNOW ANYONE THAT'S DONE AN NDA?

03:21:08.456 --> 03:21:10.358
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, MADAM.

03:21:10.425 --> 03:21:13.027
THANK YOU, MISS DAVIES.

MR. SPEAKER. I AGREE WITH MANY

03:21:21.202 --> 03:21:24.572
OF MY COLLEAGUES. WE KNOW THAT

03:21:24.639 --> 03:21:25.106
GERRYMANDERING IS BAD FOR

03:21:25.173 --> 03:21:26.407
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. OUR

03:21:26.474 --> 03:21:28.776
SYSTEM WAS BUILT ON CHECKS AND

03:21:28.843 --> 03:21:30.211
BALANCES, AND UNFORTUNATELY,

03:21:30.278 --> 03:21:33.281
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A DICTATOR IN

03:21:33.347 --> 03:21:35.049
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND WE HAVE A

03:21:35.116 --> 03:21:36.317
CONGRESS THAT HAS COMPLETELY

03:21:36.384 --> 03:21:38.553
ABDICATED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

03:21:38.619 --> 03:21:41.756
TO ACT AS THAT. CHECK ON THAT

03:21:41.823 --> 03:21:46.227
DICTATOR. AND I DO NOT FOR A

03:21:46.294 --> 03:21:47.895
MOMENT WANT US TO LEAVE HERE

03:21:47.962 --> 03:21:50.131
WITH SOUND BITES OF

03:21:50.198 --> 03:21:52.400
SANCTIMONIOUS PEARL CLUTCHING

FROM MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT

03:21:53.601 --> 03:21:55.336
PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT

03:21:55.403 --> 03:21:58.005
MAKING SURE WE TALK ABOUT WHAT

03:21:58.072 --> 03:21:59.307
OUR LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN DOING

03:21:59.373 --> 03:22:01.342
THIS YEAR TO PROTECT

03:22:01.409 --> 03:22:04.212
CALIFORNIANS. NOT ONE OF MY

COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE HAS

03:22:06.113 --> 03:22:07.582
CONDEMNED THE PRESIDENT FOR

03:22:07.648 --> 03:22:09.283
TURNING OUR MILITARY AGAINST

03:22:09.350 --> 03:22:13.187
OUR OWN PEOPLE IN LA AND IN

03:22:13.254 --> 03:22:14.956

03:22:17.658 --> 03:22:18.693
PRESIDENT FOR SENDING ARMED

03:22:18.759 --> 03:22:21.162
THUGS TO A PRESS CONFERENCE

03:22:21.229 --> 03:22:22.296
THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE

03:22:22.363 --> 03:22:23.631
LEGISLATURE WAS HAVING LAST

03:22:23.698 --> 03:22:26.367
WEEK, IN AN ACT OF INTIMIDATION.

03:22:26.434 --> 03:22:27.935
NOT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS

WITHHOLDING FUNDS FOR FIRE

03:22:39.981 --> 03:22:43.150
VICTIMS IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE'RE

GOING TO TALK ABOUT PROTECTING

03:22:45.353 --> 03:22:47.054
CALIFORNIANS, WE'RE GOING TO

03:22:47.121 --> 03:22:48.356
TALK ABOUT HOW THIS LEGISLATURE

03:22:48.422 --> 03:22:50.925
IS PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS. TO

03:22:50.992 --> 03:22:53.094
QUOTE AND PARAPHRASE BEN

03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:56.097
FRANKLIN, IT'S A DEMOCRACY IF

03:22:56.163 --> 03:22:58.266
THEY CHOOSE TO KEEP IT. EVERY

03:22:58.332 --> 03:23:00.201
TIME WE GO TO THE BALLOT BOX,

03:23:00.268 --> 03:23:02.270
WE GET TO CHOOSE IF WE ARE

03:23:02.336 --> 03:23:05.039
GOING TO FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY.

03:23:05.106 --> 03:23:06.274
AND THIS NOVEMBER, CALIFORNIANS

03:23:06.340 --> 03:23:09.877

03:23:09.944 --> 03:23:12.580
CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO FIGHT

03:23:12.647 --> 03:23:16.183
FOR DEMOCRACY. THANK YOU,

03:23:16.250 --> 03:23:18.052
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGERS,

ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG, YOU ARE

03:23:20.421 --> 03:23:21.822
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

03:23:21.889 --> 03:23:23.124
SPEAKER. I RISE AS A PROUD

03:23:23.190 --> 03:23:25.293
COAUTHOR OF H.R. EIGHT AND ITS

03:23:25.359 --> 03:23:26.961
IMPORTANCE IN DEFENDING OUR

03:23:27.028 --> 03:23:29.096
DEMOCRACY. WE DIDN'T ASK FOR

03:23:29.163 --> 03:23:30.398
THIS FIGHT, AND WE NEED TO

03:23:30.464 --> 03:23:31.265
FIGHT BACK AGAINST PRESIDENT

03:23:31.332 --> 03:23:33.167
TRUMP'S POWER GRAB. THIS IS

03:23:33.234 --> 03:23:34.502
MORE ABOUT DEFENDING OUR

03:23:34.569 --> 03:23:36.003
DEMOCRACY AND MAKING SURE THAT

03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:38.172
EVERY VOICE COUNTS. THIS IS OUR

03:23:38.239 --> 03:23:39.407
CHANCE TO STAND UP AND RAISE

03:23:39.473 --> 03:23:41.108
OUR VOICES TO FIGHT FOR OUR

03:23:41.175 --> 03:23:42.343
DEMOCRACY. THE STAKES COULDN'T

03:23:42.410 --> 03:23:44.245
BE HIGHER. THE PRESENT FEDERAL

03:23:44.312 --> 03:23:44.946
ADMINISTRATION IS DENYING

03:23:45.012 --> 03:23:47.181
WILDFIRE RELIEF TARGETING OUR

03:23:47.248 --> 03:23:48.816
DIVERSE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES,

03:23:48.883 --> 03:23:50.117
TARGETING OUR NUMBER ONE PUBLIC

03:23:50.184 --> 03:23:52.787
UNIVERSITY WITH AN EXTRADITION

03:23:52.853 --> 03:23:53.988
REQUEST OF $1 BILLION AND

03:23:54.055 --> 03:23:55.189
PULLING MILLIONS OFF OF HEALTH

03:23:55.256 --> 03:23:57.325

03:23:58.559 --> 03:24:00.361
ACT AND PROTECT OUR

03:24:00.428 --> 03:24:01.162
HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED

03:24:01.228 --> 03:24:03.097
COMMUNITIES. WE MUST FIGHT FIRE

03:24:03.164 --> 03:24:07.268
WITH FIRE, AND WE WILL LET THE

03:24:07.335 --> 03:24:08.569
VOTERS DECIDE. THAT IS

03:24:08.636 --> 03:24:09.937
DEMOCRACY AT ITS BEST. I

03:24:10.004 --> 03:24:12.440
STRONGLY URGE, AND I VOTE ON

03:24:12.506 --> 03:24:15.242
ACR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

03:24:15.309 --> 03:24:16.143
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. MEMBERS,

THIS IS A LAST CALL TO RAISE

03:24:18.312 --> 03:24:19.447
YOUR MICROPHONE IF YOU ARE

03:24:19.513 --> 03:24:21.382
GOING TO BE SPEAKING ON ACR

03:24:21.449 --> 03:24:23.551

03:24:23.618 --> 03:24:25.186
ASSEMBLY MEMBER JEFF GONZALEZ

03:24:25.252 --> 03:24:36.030
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES.

03:24:36.097 --> 03:24:39.500
TODAY I RISE IN COMPLETE AND

03:24:39.567 --> 03:24:42.770
UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. WE'RE

03:24:42.837 --> 03:24:46.173
ABOUT TO POTENTIALLY WASTE $230

03:24:46.240 --> 03:24:47.742
MILLION TO UNDO SOMETHING

03:24:47.808 --> 03:24:50.378
CALIFORNIANS ALREADY DECIDED ON

03:24:50.444 --> 03:24:52.880
IN 2010 THAT AN INDEPENDENT

03:24:52.947 --> 03:24:53.481
COMMISSION, NOT THE GOVERNOR

03:24:53.547 --> 03:24:55.316
AND NOT THE LEGISLATURE, SHOULD

03:24:55.383 --> 03:24:56.984
DRAW DISTRICT LINES. THE

03:24:57.051 --> 03:24:59.553
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS DON'T

03:24:59.620 --> 03:25:03.024
WANT THIS. YET HERE WE ARE. I'M

03:25:03.090 --> 03:25:04.191
EXHAUSTED THAT THIS IS WHAT

03:25:04.258 --> 03:25:06.527
WE'RE CHOOSING TO SPEND OUR

03:25:06.594 --> 03:25:09.196
TIME ON. THIS BODY HAS ALL THE

03:25:09.263 --> 03:25:11.365
POWER TO MAKE THE LIVES OF

03:25:11.432 --> 03:25:12.533
CALIFORNIANS BETTER, AND

03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:15.036
CALIFORNIANS ARE SICK AND TIRED

03:25:15.102 --> 03:25:17.605
OF WATCHING US COME TO THIS

03:25:17.672 --> 03:25:20.007
FLOOR WEEK AFTER WEEK, WITH NO

03:25:20.074 --> 03:25:21.308
SOLUTIONS TO THIS, TO THE

03:25:21.375 --> 03:25:23.577
CRISES THAT ARE FACED THAT

03:25:23.644 --> 03:25:25.246
WE'RE FACING. WE AS A BODY ARE

03:25:25.312 --> 03:25:27.715
OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE ISSUES

03:25:27.782 --> 03:25:29.116
RAGING IN OUR STATE, FROM

03:25:29.183 --> 03:25:31.185
AFFORDABILITY, HEALTH CARE, TO

03:25:31.252 --> 03:25:32.319
THE HOUSING CRISIS TO

03:25:32.386 --> 03:25:34.155
HOMELESSNESS. AS A MARINE CORPS

03:25:34.221 --> 03:25:36.691
VETERAN, IT SICKENS ME TO KNOW

03:25:36.757 --> 03:25:39.060
THAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO I FOUGHT

03:25:39.126 --> 03:25:40.761
ALONGSIDE ARE SLEEPING ON THE

03:25:40.828 --> 03:25:44.432
STREETS. WE CAN FIX THAT, BUT

03:25:44.498 --> 03:25:46.233
WE AREN'T. INSTEAD, THE

03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:48.035
GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF THIS

03:25:48.102 --> 03:25:49.270
BODY ARE PLAYING PARTIZAN

03:25:49.336 --> 03:25:52.406
POLITICS. LET ME BE CLEAR.

03:25:52.473 --> 03:25:54.542
CALIFORNIANS IN MY DISTRICT

03:25:54.608 --> 03:25:57.011
TELL ME EVERY DAY THEY FEEL

03:25:57.078 --> 03:25:59.480
FORGOTTEN BY THIS BODY.

03:25:59.547 --> 03:26:02.283
FORGOTTEN. LET ME BE CLEAR

03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:04.318
ABOUT THAT. YOU SEE, IN MY

03:26:04.385 --> 03:26:06.187
DISTRICT, THE NEEDS ARE URGENT

03:26:06.253 --> 03:26:09.123
AND REAL. PALO VERDE HOSPITAL

03:26:09.190 --> 03:26:11.759
IN BLYTHE IS ON THE BRINK OF

03:26:11.826 --> 03:26:13.194
CLOSURE. I REQUESTED 4 MILLION

03:26:13.260 --> 03:26:14.995
IN EMERGENCY FUNDING TO KEEP IT

03:26:15.062 --> 03:26:17.198
OPERATING. A LIFELINE THAT WAS

03:26:17.264 --> 03:26:20.101
THAT WAS NOT FULFILLED. AS A

03:26:20.167 --> 03:26:21.635
RESULT, THE HOSPITAL NOW FACES

03:26:21.702 --> 03:26:23.070
AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE, AND

03:26:23.137 --> 03:26:25.439
RESIDENTS OF BLYTHE COULD SOON

03:26:25.506 --> 03:26:28.309
BE FORCED TO TRAVEL OVER 100

03:26:28.375 --> 03:26:30.311
MILES JUST TO ACCESS EMERGENCY

03:26:30.377 --> 03:26:33.214
CARE. THIS IS NOT JUST A HEALTH

03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:35.516
CARE ISSUE, IT'S A PUBLIC

03:26:35.583 --> 03:26:37.118
SAFETY CRISIS. IN IMPERIAL

03:26:37.184 --> 03:26:39.253
COUNTY, THE LAST SUGAR BEET

03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:40.988
PLANT SPRECKELS HAS SHUT DOWN,

03:26:41.055 --> 03:26:44.325
WIPING OUT OVER 700 JOBS IN A

03:26:44.391 --> 03:26:48.195
COUNTY THAT ALREADY SUFFERS A

03:26:48.262 --> 03:26:51.031
20% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. AND YET,

03:26:51.098 --> 03:26:53.300
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON JOBS,

03:26:53.367 --> 03:26:55.369
WE'RE DEBATING ON

03:26:55.436 --> 03:26:57.138
GERRYMANDERING AT IRONWOOD

03:26:57.204 --> 03:26:58.405
STATE PRISON IN BLYTHE.

03:26:58.472 --> 03:27:00.074
LEADERSHIP IS DOING INCREDIBLE

03:27:00.141 --> 03:27:02.176
WORK REHABILITATING

03:27:02.243 --> 03:27:03.944
INCARCERATED PEOPLE WITH

03:27:04.011 --> 03:27:06.147
PROGRAMS THAT GIVES MEN

03:27:06.213 --> 03:27:09.316
SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

03:27:09.383 --> 03:27:11.685
IMAGINE WHAT A FRACTION OF THIS

03:27:11.752 --> 03:27:14.488
MONEY COULD DO THERE IN THE

03:27:14.555 --> 03:27:15.623
MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES FROM

03:27:15.689 --> 03:27:18.092
WINCHESTER TO ANZA, FAMILIES

03:27:18.159 --> 03:27:20.060
LIVE WITH THE CONSTANT THREAT

03:27:20.127 --> 03:27:22.296
OF WILDFIRES. WE SHOULD BE

03:27:22.363 --> 03:27:24.098
FILLING RESERVOIRS AND DOING

03:27:24.165 --> 03:27:27.434
REAL FOREST MANAGEMENT. BUT WE

03:27:27.501 --> 03:27:29.270
AREN'T. I'VE HEARD ARGUMENTS IN

03:27:29.336 --> 03:27:30.171
THESE HALLS THAT JUST BECAUSE

03:27:30.237 --> 03:27:32.239
TEXAS IS DOING IT, WE SHOULD

03:27:32.306 --> 03:27:34.308
TOO, THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS

03:27:34.375 --> 03:27:35.810
HOLDING ON TO MONEY THAT SHOULD

03:27:35.876 --> 03:27:37.278
GO TO CALIFORNIA AND DEMOCRACY

03:27:37.344 --> 03:27:40.047
IS IN FLAMES. COLLEAGUES, TWO

03:27:40.114 --> 03:27:42.149
WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT, LIKE

03:27:42.216 --> 03:27:43.350
MY COLLEAGUE SAID. BUT IF

03:27:43.417 --> 03:27:46.153
DEMOCRACY IS ON THE LINE, THEN

03:27:46.220 --> 03:27:47.221
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE

03:27:47.288 --> 03:27:49.490
STRENGTHENING IT, NOT RIGGING

03:27:49.557 --> 03:27:51.692
IT FOR POLITICAL GAIN. HUNDREDS

03:27:51.759 --> 03:27:54.061
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COULD BE

03:27:54.128 --> 03:27:56.530
DIRECTED TOWARDS FIGHTING FOOD

03:27:56.597 --> 03:27:56.964
INSECURITY, HELPING

03:27:57.031 --> 03:27:59.066
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FIND AND THE

03:27:59.133 --> 03:28:00.434
IMPERIAL VALLEY FOOD BANKS WHO

03:28:00.501 --> 03:28:02.069
ARE DOING GOD'S WORK EVERY

03:28:02.136 --> 03:28:04.305
SINGLE DAY AND SERVING THE MOST

03:28:04.371 --> 03:28:06.006
VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

03:28:06.073 --> 03:28:08.342
WE CANNOT CLAIM TO SERVE THE

03:28:08.409 --> 03:28:09.910
PEOPLE WHILE PRIORITIZING THEIR

03:28:09.977 --> 03:28:12.179
MOST BASIC NEEDS. AND I COULD

03:28:12.246 --> 03:28:15.382
GO ON. FAMILIES IN IMPERIAL,

03:28:15.449 --> 03:28:16.584
RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO

03:28:16.650 --> 03:28:18.986
COUNTY CAN'T AFFORD GAS,

03:28:19.053 --> 03:28:20.988
GROCERIES, CHILD CARE. PARENTS

03:28:21.055 --> 03:28:22.690
ARE CHOOSING BETWEEN FILLING

03:28:22.756 --> 03:28:24.425
THEIR GAS TANKS OR THEIR FRIDGE.

03:28:24.491 --> 03:28:26.360
THAT'S THE REALITY. MY DISTRICT

03:28:26.427 --> 03:28:29.496
IS LIVING WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY.

03:28:29.563 --> 03:28:31.966
SO LET ME ASK, WHY ARE WE

03:28:32.032 --> 03:28:34.068
WASTING TIME AND MONEY ON

03:28:34.134 --> 03:28:36.003
RECKLESS MEASURES THAT IS BEING

03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:38.939
PUSHED DOWN ONTO CALIFORNIANS

03:28:39.006 --> 03:28:40.241
FROM THOSE AT THE HIGHEST

03:28:40.307 --> 03:28:41.308
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IN OUR

03:28:41.375 --> 03:28:43.177
STATE? YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS AT

03:28:43.244 --> 03:28:45.379
WAR, AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO SEE

03:28:45.446 --> 03:28:47.047
THE THREATS COMING AT ME. BUT

03:28:47.114 --> 03:28:49.149
HERE IN SACRAMENTO, I HAVE NO

03:28:49.216 --> 03:28:51.352
IDEA ABOUT THE BACKROOM DEALS.

03:28:51.418 --> 03:28:53.420
30S 30S CAN'T GET ANSWERS AS TO

03:28:53.487 --> 03:28:55.089
WHO ACTUALLY DREW THE LINES. I

03:28:55.155 --> 03:28:57.157
RAN FOR OFFICE BECAUSE OF MY

03:28:57.224 --> 03:28:59.026
SON RJ, WHO HAS CEREBRAL PALSY.

03:28:59.093 --> 03:29:01.195
HE CAN'T SPEAK TO HIM FOR

03:29:01.262 --> 03:29:03.364
HIMSELF, SO I RAN TO BE HIS

03:29:03.430 --> 03:29:06.500
VOICE AND THE VOICE FOR HIS

03:29:06.567 --> 03:29:07.234
FAMILIES, AND WE FOUGHT

03:29:07.301 --> 03:29:08.903
TOGETHER TO TAKE BACK IN

03:29:08.969 --> 03:29:10.271
IN-HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. WE

03:29:10.337 --> 03:29:12.373
WORK TOGETHER TO DO THAT. WE

03:29:12.439 --> 03:29:15.009
CAN DO SO MUCH MORE. WE CAN GET

03:29:15.075 --> 03:29:16.944
SO MUCH MORE DONE. SO,

03:29:17.011 --> 03:29:19.079
COLLEAGUES, I END BY SAYING

03:29:19.146 --> 03:29:21.315
THIS LET'S RISE UP. LET'S WORK

03:29:21.382 --> 03:29:23.150
TOGETHER TO FIX THE PROBLEMS IN

03:29:23.217 --> 03:29:25.786
OUR STATE BECAUSE WE CAN DO IT.

03:29:25.853 --> 03:29:27.421
I'VE SEEN IT DONE. SO LET'S

03:29:27.488 --> 03:29:30.891
MAKE THIS HAPPEN. THANK YOU,

03:29:30.958 --> 03:29:31.425
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ.

03:29:31.492 --> 03:29:33.127
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA,

03:29:33.193 --> 03:29:35.296
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

03:29:35.362 --> 03:29:37.097
MR. SPEAKER AND MEMBERS, FOR

03:29:37.164 --> 03:29:38.332
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON

03:29:38.399 --> 03:29:41.001
THIS FLOOR. I DON'T OFTENTIMES

03:29:41.068 --> 03:29:43.304
SPEAK, BUT I FELT CALLED TODAY

03:29:43.370 --> 03:29:45.039
TO BE ABLE TO SHARE SOME WORDS.

03:29:45.105 --> 03:29:47.875
JUST YESTERDAY, AN ICON OF THIS

03:29:47.942 --> 03:29:50.177
GREAT COUNTRY REMINDED ME OF

03:29:50.244 --> 03:29:52.212
OUR FAMILY'S ROOTS THAT BEGAN

03:29:52.279 --> 03:29:55.382
IN TEXAS. MY FATHER BEING BORN

03:29:55.449 --> 03:29:58.819
IN BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS, IN 1952

03:29:58.886 --> 03:30:00.154
DURING A PARTICULARLY RACIST

03:30:00.220 --> 03:30:02.222
AND XENOPHOBIC PERIOD IN

03:30:02.289 --> 03:30:04.224
AMERICAN HISTORY, A TIME THAT

03:30:04.291 --> 03:30:07.127
WAS KNOWN AS OPERATION. WHAT IS

03:30:07.194 --> 03:30:10.698
STILL TO THIS DAY, AMERICA'S

03:30:10.764 --> 03:30:11.999
LARGEST MASS DEPORTATION EVENT,

03:30:12.066 --> 03:30:14.335
AN EVENT THAT HELPED TO SWEEP

03:30:14.401 --> 03:30:17.304
UP MY FATHER, WHO IS AN

03:30:17.371 --> 03:30:19.173
AMERICAN CITIZEN AND DEPORTED

03:30:19.239 --> 03:30:21.508
OUR FAMILY TO MEXICO, THAT WE

03:30:21.575 --> 03:30:24.211
LEARNED THAT THERE ARE STATES

03:30:24.278 --> 03:30:26.113
THAT VALUE AND GIVE DIGNITY AND

03:30:26.180 --> 03:30:28.382
RESPECT TO ALL WHO CALL THAT

03:30:28.449 --> 03:30:30.417
STATE HOME AND STATES THAT DO

03:30:30.484 --> 03:30:33.220
NOT. AND SO WE MIGRATED TO THE

03:30:33.287 --> 03:30:35.990
GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA, TO

03:30:36.056 --> 03:30:37.691
DELANO, WHERE IT WAS DOLORES

03:30:37.758 --> 03:30:39.026
HUERTA WHO REMINDED ME

03:30:39.093 --> 03:30:41.428
YESTERDAY THAT WE WERE FIGHTING

03:30:41.495 --> 03:30:43.831
FOR DIGNITY AND RESPECT WHEN IT

03:30:43.897 --> 03:30:46.200
WAS UFW. MY FATHER, WHO I SPOKE

03:30:46.266 --> 03:30:47.501
ABOUT EARLIER, ALSO HAD THE

03:30:47.568 --> 03:30:50.137
HONOR OF SERVING IN THIS

03:30:50.204 --> 03:30:51.372
INSTITUTION WHERE HE HAD AN

03:30:51.438 --> 03:30:54.341
INDEPENDENT STREAK. NOW, BACK

03:30:54.408 --> 03:30:57.177
IN 2008, HE WAS ONE OF THOSE

03:30:57.244 --> 03:30:59.146
DEMOCRATS WHO, ALONG WITH

03:30:59.213 --> 03:31:00.347
REPUBLICANS, VOTED FOR THE

03:31:00.414 --> 03:31:02.049
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

03:31:02.116 --> 03:31:03.751
COMMISSION TO GO BEFORE THE

03:31:03.817 --> 03:31:05.986
PEOPLE. AND SO IT IS WITH GREAT

03:31:06.053 --> 03:31:08.389
PRIDE THAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN

03:31:08.455 --> 03:31:09.957
WATCHING THEIR WORK AND HONORED

03:31:10.024 --> 03:31:12.159
BY THE SERVICE OF THOSE WHO

03:31:12.226 --> 03:31:13.327
WISH TO SERVE ON THAT

03:31:13.394 --> 03:31:15.095
COMMISSION. AND I, TOO, WAS

03:31:15.162 --> 03:31:17.197
WATCHING EACH ONE OF THOSE

03:31:17.264 --> 03:31:18.832
HEARINGS AND IMPRESSED WITH

03:31:18.899 --> 03:31:21.201
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN 2020. BUT

03:31:21.268 --> 03:31:23.303
I HAD DINNER WITH MY FATHER

03:31:23.370 --> 03:31:25.105
THIS PAST WEEKEND, AND I SPOKE

03:31:25.172 --> 03:31:27.274
WITH HIM ABOUT THAT VOTE, AND

03:31:27.341 --> 03:31:29.043
HE REMINDED ME THAT TODAY'S

03:31:29.109 --> 03:31:31.211
ELECTORATE LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN

03:31:31.278 --> 03:31:32.946
WHEN HE MADE THAT VOTE NEARLY

03:31:33.013 --> 03:31:35.115
TWO DECADES AGO, THAT TODAY'S

03:31:35.182 --> 03:31:36.517
DEMOCRACY LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN

03:31:36.583 --> 03:31:38.585
IT WAS TWO DECADES AGO, AND

03:31:38.652 --> 03:31:40.487
THAT FUNDAMENTALLY,

03:31:40.554 --> 03:31:41.722
REPRESENTATION IS ABOUT

03:31:41.789 --> 03:31:43.524
RETURNING RESOURCES, THE TAXES

03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:46.026
THAT WE PAY. AND FOR THOSE OF

03:31:46.093 --> 03:31:48.062
US WHO COME FROM POOR AREAS,

03:31:48.128 --> 03:31:49.329
WHO REPRESENT POOR PEOPLE, WE

03:31:49.396 --> 03:31:51.065
ARE NOT GETTING OUR FAIR SHARE.

03:31:51.131 --> 03:31:53.567
AND THE REPRESENTATION THAT WE

03:31:53.634 --> 03:31:54.668
HAVE IN CONGRESS IS NOT

03:31:54.735 --> 03:31:57.137
RETURNING RESOURCES. THAT BIG,

03:31:57.204 --> 03:32:01.408
BEAUTIFUL BILL WAS BAD FOR OUR

03:32:01.475 --> 03:32:03.510
COMMUNITIES, AND DESPITE MY

03:32:03.577 --> 03:32:06.713
IDEALS OF WANTING TO FIGHT FOR

03:32:06.780 --> 03:32:07.314
INDEPENDENCE IN REDISTRICTING,

03:32:07.381 --> 03:32:09.083
WE MUST MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING

03:32:09.149 --> 03:32:11.351
OUR FAIR SHARE OF RESOURCES.

03:32:11.418 --> 03:32:13.454
AND SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE

03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:15.289
TO STAND UP AGAINST YOUR IDEALS

03:32:15.355 --> 03:32:17.324
AND STAND UP FOR YOUR MORALS.

03:32:17.391 --> 03:32:19.059
YOU HAVE TO STAND UP FOR

03:32:19.126 --> 03:32:21.562
COMMUNITY, WHO TOO OFTEN

03:32:21.628 --> 03:32:22.830
DOESN'T GET REPRESENTED HERE IN

03:32:22.896 --> 03:32:25.466
THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. AND SO I

03:32:25.532 --> 03:32:26.967
WILL PUT MY IDEALS TO THE SIDE

03:32:27.034 --> 03:32:29.203
AND INSTEAD STAND UP FOR OUR

03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:31.638
MORALS. BUT IT COMES WITH A

03:32:31.705 --> 03:32:33.273
WARNING THAT THIS INSTITUTION

03:32:33.340 --> 03:32:35.943
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST THE

03:32:36.009 --> 03:32:37.144
TEMPTATION TO COME BACK HERE

03:32:37.211 --> 03:32:40.047
AGAIN, AND THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE

03:32:40.114 --> 03:32:43.150
SURE THAT WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY

03:32:43.217 --> 03:32:45.085
BELIEVING THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN

03:32:45.152 --> 03:32:47.121
THAT INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

03:32:47.187 --> 03:32:48.856
COMMISSION. SO I WILL TELL YOU,

03:32:48.922 --> 03:32:51.525
WHILE I SHARE THAT FEAR, WHAT I

03:32:51.592 --> 03:32:53.060
PUT MY FAITH IN, I PUT MY FAITH

03:32:53.127 --> 03:32:54.294
THAT THERE'S SOMEONE HERE IN

03:32:54.361 --> 03:32:56.296
THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:32:56.363 --> 03:32:58.665
WHO ONE DAY WILL BE WALKING

03:32:58.732 --> 03:33:00.033
AROUND BEING THE PRESIDENT OF

03:33:00.100 --> 03:33:01.368
THE UNITED STATES AND THE WHITE

03:33:01.435 --> 03:33:03.103
HOUSE, AND THAT OUR GOVERNOR

03:33:03.170 --> 03:33:05.172
THEN WILL BE ABLE TO PASS

03:33:05.239 --> 03:33:06.773
FEDERAL INDEPENDENT

03:33:06.840 --> 03:33:08.075
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION FOR

03:33:08.142 --> 03:33:10.277
ALL STATES. AND BY DOING THAT,

03:33:10.344 --> 03:33:13.347
WE CAN HAVE A BALANCED LEVEL

03:33:13.413 --> 03:33:15.549
PLAYING FIELD WHERE EVERY

03:33:15.616 --> 03:33:17.718
SINGLE PERSON COUNTS AND WE

03:33:17.784 --> 03:33:19.453
HAVE REPRESENTATION THAT IS

03:33:19.520 --> 03:33:20.954
RETURNING RESOURCES FOR OUR

03:33:21.021 --> 03:33:24.224
COMMUNITIES. I PUT FAITH IN THE

03:33:24.291 --> 03:33:26.059
PEOPLE OF OUR STATE TO DECIDE

03:33:26.126 --> 03:33:28.228
THEIR FUTURE, THAT WHILE WE

03:33:28.295 --> 03:33:29.396
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A STATE

03:33:29.463 --> 03:33:32.432
WHEN OUR NATION WAS CREATED, WE

03:33:32.499 --> 03:33:34.234
ARE THE BEARER OF ITS FUTURE.

03:33:34.301 --> 03:33:37.237
IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO RISE

03:33:37.304 --> 03:33:40.240
UP AND TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY.

03:33:40.307 --> 03:33:42.476
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

03:33:42.543 --> 03:33:44.478
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:33:44.545 --> 03:33:46.647
MEMBER. ARAMBULA ASSEMBLY

03:33:46.713 --> 03:33:52.920
MEMBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

03:33:52.986 --> 03:33:56.223
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. THIS

03:33:56.290 --> 03:33:57.758
MEASURE BEFORE US IS NEITHER

03:33:57.824 --> 03:34:01.261
BOLD NOR PRINCIPLED. IT IS, IN

03:34:01.328 --> 03:34:02.196
PLAIN TERMS, A BLATANT ATTACK

03:34:02.262 --> 03:34:04.565
ON THE MOST TRANSPARENT PROCESS

03:34:04.631 --> 03:34:07.067
OUR STATE HAS EVER HAD FOR

03:34:07.134 --> 03:34:09.770
DRAWING CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS.

03:34:09.836 --> 03:34:10.971
IT UNDERMINES WHAT HAS BECOME

03:34:11.038 --> 03:34:12.172
THE GOLD STANDARD FOR THE

03:34:12.239 --> 03:34:14.541
NATION. THE INDEPENDENT

03:34:14.608 --> 03:34:15.676
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

03:34:15.742 --> 03:34:17.411
COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION WAS

03:34:17.477 --> 03:34:20.047
CREATED TO RESTORE FAIRNESS, TO

03:34:20.113 --> 03:34:21.748
ENSURE REPRESENTATION IN

03:34:21.815 --> 03:34:23.417
CALIFORNIA IS NOT BASED ON

03:34:23.483 --> 03:34:25.052
WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE

03:34:25.118 --> 03:34:26.687
GOVERNMENT, BUT ON PRINCIPLES

03:34:26.753 --> 03:34:28.956
OF INDEPENDENCE, TRANSPARENCY

03:34:29.022 --> 03:34:31.658
AND COMMUNITY. AND IT WORKED.

03:34:31.725 --> 03:34:33.060
CALIFORNIANS CAN LOOK AT THEIR

03:34:33.126 --> 03:34:35.195
DISTRICTS TODAY, AND THEY KNOW

03:34:35.262 --> 03:34:37.397
THAT THEY WERE NOT MANIPULATED

03:34:37.464 --> 03:34:39.466
FOR PARTIZAN ADVANTAGE. AND NOW,

03:34:39.533 --> 03:34:42.002
IN JUST FOUR DAYS, WITH TWO

03:34:42.069 --> 03:34:43.337
RUSHED COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND

03:34:43.403 --> 03:34:45.272
ALMOST NO OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:34:45.339 --> 03:34:48.242
PUBLIC COMMENT, WE ARE ON THE

03:34:48.308 --> 03:34:50.043
VERGE OF THROWING ALL OF THAT

03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:54.014
AWAY. LET ME REMIND THIS BODY.

03:34:54.081 --> 03:34:55.315
DURING COMMITTEE HEARINGS, ONE

03:34:55.382 --> 03:34:57.084
OF OUR COLLEAGUES BRAZENLY

03:34:57.150 --> 03:34:59.987
ADMITTED THAT THIS ENTIRE THING

03:35:00.053 --> 03:35:02.756
WAS ABOUT PARTIZAN

03:35:02.823 --> 03:35:04.725
GERRYMANDERING, ADMITTED

03:35:04.791 --> 03:35:07.294
PARTIZAN POLITICS. THIS WAS A

03:35:07.361 --> 03:35:09.396
DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION

03:35:09.463 --> 03:35:11.531
ABOUT PROTECTING VOTERS AND

03:35:11.598 --> 03:35:14.101
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. NOT A

03:35:14.167 --> 03:35:17.004
WORD ABOUT FAIRNESS, NOT A WORD

03:35:17.070 --> 03:35:18.538
ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. AN OPEN

03:35:18.605 --> 03:35:21.241
ADMISSION TO PARTIZAN GAIN. SO

03:35:21.308 --> 03:35:23.076
HOW CAN WE STAND IN THIS

03:35:23.143 --> 03:35:25.279
CHAMBER AND CRITICIZE TEXAS,

03:35:25.345 --> 03:35:26.913
FLORIDA OR OTHER STATES FOR

03:35:26.980 --> 03:35:28.148
GERRYMANDERING WHEN WE'VE

03:35:28.215 --> 03:35:29.916
JOINED THEM IN THE SAME

03:35:29.983 --> 03:35:31.051
PRACTICE? HOW CAN WE DEMAND

03:35:31.118 --> 03:35:32.653
FAIRNESS IN THE COURTS OR

03:35:32.719 --> 03:35:34.321
BEFORE CONGRESS WHEN WE'RE

03:35:34.388 --> 03:35:36.256
WILLING TO SACRIFICE IT HERE AT

03:35:36.323 --> 03:35:38.292
HOME? WE HAVE LOST ALL

03:35:38.358 --> 03:35:41.061
CREDIBILITY. LET'S NOT FORGET

03:35:41.128 --> 03:35:43.930
THIS IS NOT FREE. WE ARE

03:35:43.997 --> 03:35:46.066
WASTING MONEY AND RESOURCES ON

03:35:46.133 --> 03:35:48.468
AN ELECTION THAT IS UNNECESSARY

03:35:48.535 --> 03:35:49.936
AND UNWANTED. EVERY DOLLAR

03:35:50.003 --> 03:35:51.171
SPENT ON THIS POLITICAL STUNT

03:35:51.238 --> 03:35:53.340
IS A DOLLAR NOT SPENT ON

03:35:53.407 --> 03:35:54.541
ADDRESSING THE COST OF LIVING

03:35:54.608 --> 03:35:56.443
CRISIS OR WILDFIRES, NOT

03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:57.611
SPENDING ON IMPROVING OUR

03:35:57.678 --> 03:35:59.646
SCHOOLS, NOT SPENT ON KEEPING

03:35:59.713 --> 03:36:01.348
OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE AND NOT

03:36:01.415 --> 03:36:03.083
SPENT ON EXPANDING HEALTH CARE

03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:05.485
ACCESS. CALIFORNIANS NEVER

03:36:05.552 --> 03:36:07.087
ASKED FOR THIS ELECTION. WHAT

03:36:07.154 --> 03:36:10.123
THEY DID ASK FOR WAS TO FULLY

03:36:10.190 --> 03:36:11.458
FUND PROP 36, WHICH THIS

03:36:11.525 --> 03:36:13.126
LEGISLATURE FAILED TO DO. WHAT

03:36:13.193 --> 03:36:15.228
THEY ASKED FOR WAS FOR US NOT

03:36:15.295 --> 03:36:17.030
TO RATION MEDI-CAL BECAUSE

03:36:17.097 --> 03:36:18.732
CALIFORNIANS AND FAMILIES ARE

03:36:18.799 --> 03:36:25.806
DYING. DYING. WE WERE TOLD AT

03:36:25.872 --> 03:36:27.040
THE START OF THIS SESSION THAT

03:36:27.107 --> 03:36:28.575
OUR PRIORITY WAS ADDRESSING

03:36:28.642 --> 03:36:30.177
COST OF LIVING. YET I HAVEN'T

03:36:30.243 --> 03:36:32.212
SEEN ANY BILLS RUSHED THROUGH

03:36:32.279 --> 03:36:34.114
FOR DAYS TO LOWER UTILITY RATES

03:36:34.181 --> 03:36:36.283
TO MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE,

03:36:36.350 --> 03:36:38.352
TO BRING DOWN OUR FOOD PRICES.

03:36:38.418 --> 03:36:39.586
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE BILLS

03:36:39.653 --> 03:36:41.755
THAT SERVE POLITICAL AMBITION,

03:36:41.822 --> 03:36:43.423
SUDDENLY FOUR DAYS IS PLENTY OF

03:36:43.490 --> 03:36:46.360
TIME. SUDDENLY, COAUTHORING

03:36:46.426 --> 03:36:47.994
BILLS WITHOUT EVEN READING THEM

03:36:48.061 --> 03:36:50.397
IS NO PROBLEM. THIS ISN'T JUST

03:36:50.464 --> 03:36:53.066
BAD POLICY. IT FLIES IN THE

03:36:53.133 --> 03:36:56.303
FACE OF ESTABLISHED FACT. STUDY

03:36:56.370 --> 03:36:57.404
AFTER STUDY SHOWS

03:36:57.471 --> 03:36:59.239
GERRYMANDERING REDUCES FEDERAL

03:36:59.306 --> 03:37:01.141
DOLLARS. COMING TO OUR

03:37:01.208 --> 03:37:02.309
COMMUNITIES DEPRESSES VOTER

03:37:02.376 --> 03:37:04.511
TURNOUTS, DISENFRANCHIZES US,

03:37:04.578 --> 03:37:06.113
AND EVEN LEADS TO LOWER WAGES.

03:37:06.179 --> 03:37:08.448
NONE OF THAT HELPS CALIFORNIANS

03:37:08.515 --> 03:37:09.583
WHO ARE ALREADY STRETCHING

03:37:09.649 --> 03:37:12.486
EVERY SINGLE PENNY THIN. NONE

03:37:12.552 --> 03:37:16.423
OF IT HELPS TO COVER RENT,

03:37:16.490 --> 03:37:17.357
GROCERY, GAS. NONE OF THAT

03:37:17.424 --> 03:37:18.925
HELPS THE FAMILIES THAT ARE

03:37:18.992 --> 03:37:20.160
DECIDING WHETHER TO PAY FOR

03:37:20.227 --> 03:37:22.095
MEDICINE, OR IF THEY CAN AFFORD

03:37:22.162 --> 03:37:23.096
THEIR UTILITY RATES, OR IF THEY

03:37:23.163 --> 03:37:25.399
CAN MAKE AN INSURANCE PAYMENT,

03:37:25.465 --> 03:37:26.333
OR IF THEY CAN AFFORD TO EVEN

03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:28.902
BUY A HOUSE FOR THE NEXT

03:37:28.969 --> 03:37:32.372
GENERATION. NONE OF IT. THESE

03:37:32.439 --> 03:37:35.409
FACTS AGAIN HIGHLIGHT MY

03:37:35.475 --> 03:37:36.877
CONCERNS WITH OUR SPENDING

03:37:36.943 --> 03:37:39.780
PROBLEM AND LEVERAGING THE

03:37:39.846 --> 03:37:42.115
FUTURE. 10 TO $30 BILLION

03:37:42.182 --> 03:37:43.383
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IS WHAT WE

03:37:43.450 --> 03:37:45.318
WERE TOLD WITH THE LAO AND THE

03:37:45.385 --> 03:37:47.687
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THAT IS

03:37:47.754 --> 03:37:49.055
YEAR OVER YEAR ALL THE WAY TO

03:37:49.122 --> 03:37:51.992
2028. IF WE DON'T STOP THIS

03:37:52.058 --> 03:37:53.627
RECKLESS SPENDING ON MEASURES

03:37:53.693 --> 03:37:54.928
LIKE THIS, WE'RE GOING TO DRAIN

03:37:54.995 --> 03:37:56.329
WHAT'S LEFT OF OUR RAINY DAY

03:37:56.396 --> 03:37:58.398
FUND, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

03:37:58.465 --> 03:37:59.966
TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CUTS FOR

03:38:00.033 --> 03:38:01.301
CALIFORNIANS. AND YOU ARE

03:38:01.368 --> 03:38:04.004
SAYING FOR PARTIZAN GAIN, IT IS

03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:05.272
WORTH IT FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE

03:38:05.338 --> 03:38:08.008
DYING. TO ME, THE MESSAGE FROM

03:38:08.074 --> 03:38:09.576
THE MAJORITY PARTY IS CLEAR

03:38:09.643 --> 03:38:10.677
PRINCIPLES AND INDEPENDENTS

03:38:10.744 --> 03:38:11.311
ONLY MATTER WHEN IT'S

03:38:11.378 --> 03:38:12.913
POLITICALLY CONVENIENT AND

03:38:12.979 --> 03:38:15.849
CALIFORNIANS CAN DO WORSE,

03:38:15.916 --> 03:38:20.153
BETTER 30S SHAMEFUL. THE LEVEL

03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:22.122
OF TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME

03:38:22.189 --> 03:38:24.424
IN THIS PARTY IS DEBILITATING

03:38:24.491 --> 03:38:25.959
OUR ABILITY TO GOVERN PROPERLY,

03:38:26.026 --> 03:38:27.294
IT IS CLAIMED. IT IS BEING

03:38:27.360 --> 03:38:28.929
CLAIMED THAT THE REASON FOR

03:38:28.995 --> 03:38:30.197
THIS BILL IS TO COMBAT

03:38:30.263 --> 03:38:30.697
AUTHORITARIANISM BEFORE

03:38:30.764 --> 03:38:32.032
REDISTRICTING, BEFORE THE BIG

03:38:32.098 --> 03:38:33.233
BEAUTIFUL BILL, BEFORE ANY CUTS

03:38:33.300 --> 03:38:34.968
WERE IMPLEMENTED. IT WAS THIS

03:38:35.035 --> 03:38:35.969
LEGISLATURE THAT STRIPPED THE

03:38:36.036 --> 03:38:37.437
MINORITY OF THE COMMITTEES

03:38:37.504 --> 03:38:38.271
BECAUSE THEY SPOKE OUT IN

03:38:38.338 --> 03:38:39.372
OPPOSITION. IT WAS THIS

03:38:39.439 --> 03:38:40.006
LEGISLATURE THAT RESTRICTED OUR

03:38:40.073 --> 03:38:41.741
TIME. THE REAL AUTHORITARIAN

03:38:41.808 --> 03:38:43.977
PROBLEM IS IN THE MIRROR. THE

03:38:44.044 --> 03:38:45.912
WHAT? ABOUTISM THANK YOU,

03:38:45.979 --> 03:38:47.914
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND EVERYWHERE

03:38:47.981 --> 03:38:50.150
ELSE, THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:38:50.217 --> 03:38:52.385
MEMBER. THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF

03:38:52.452 --> 03:38:56.323
THIS COMMITTEE. MR. ASSEMBLY

03:38:56.389 --> 03:39:06.566
MEMBER, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

03:39:06.633 --> 03:39:08.835
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. THERE'S

03:39:08.902 --> 03:39:11.004
AN OLD ADAGE FOR LAWYERS THAT

03:39:11.071 --> 03:39:13.139
WHEN WHEN THE LAW IS ON YOUR

03:39:13.206 --> 03:39:14.374
SIDE, YOU POUND THE LAW. WHEN

03:39:14.441 --> 03:39:16.009
THE FACTS ARE ON YOUR SIDE, YOU

03:39:16.076 --> 03:39:17.310
POUND THE FACTS. WHEN NEITHER

03:39:17.377 --> 03:39:19.312
THE FACTS OR THE LAW ARE ON

03:39:19.379 --> 03:39:20.981
YOUR SIDE, YOU POUND THE TABLE.

03:39:21.047 --> 03:39:22.315
AND I'LL TELL YOU, MY FRIENDS,

03:39:22.382 --> 03:39:24.017
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE,

03:39:24.084 --> 03:39:25.085
WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF

03:39:25.151 --> 03:39:27.254
POUNDING THE TABLE TODAY. MOST

03:39:27.320 --> 03:39:28.421
OF WHAT WE HEARD, INCLUDING

03:39:28.488 --> 03:39:30.023
WHAT WE JUST HEARD, WAS

03:39:30.090 --> 03:39:31.091
COMPLETELY HYPERBOLIC AND

03:39:31.157 --> 03:39:33.960
DEVOID OF FACT. AND WITH ALL

03:39:34.027 --> 03:39:36.363
THE BLUSTER, LET'S BE CLEAR

03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:37.931
ABOUT THE ADMISSION OF PARTIZAN

03:39:37.998 --> 03:39:39.332
GAIN. THERE IS A REPRESENTATIVE

03:39:39.399 --> 03:39:41.268
THAT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY IN

03:39:41.334 --> 03:39:43.336
TEXAS, ONE BY THE NAME OF

03:39:43.403 --> 03:39:45.739
REPRESENTATIVE TODD HUNTER, WHO

03:39:45.805 --> 03:39:48.341
ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS NAKEDLY

03:39:48.408 --> 03:39:50.143
PARTIZAN. WHAT HAPPENED IN

03:39:50.210 --> 03:39:51.878
TEXAS? AND I QUOTE THE

03:39:51.945 --> 03:39:54.114
UNDERLYING GOAL OF WHAT

03:39:54.180 --> 03:39:55.282
HAPPENED IN TEXAS, AS MR.

03:39:55.348 --> 03:39:59.486
HUNTER SAID OF THIS PLAN, IS

03:39:59.553 --> 03:40:02.022
STRAIGHTFORWARD TO IMPROVE

03:40:02.088 --> 03:40:03.123
REPUBLICAN POLITICAL

03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:07.427
PERFORMANCE. THAT IS, THE

03:40:07.494 --> 03:40:09.563
ADMISSION OF PARTIZAN

03:40:09.629 --> 03:40:11.097
OBJECTIVES THAT WE SHOULD BE

03:40:11.164 --> 03:40:13.867
FOCUSED ON. THAT IS THE

03:40:13.934 --> 03:40:14.901
ADMISSION OF GERRYMANDERING,

03:40:14.968 --> 03:40:18.371
THAT WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. AND

03:40:18.438 --> 03:40:21.942
FOR EVERY FRIEND ACROSS THE

03:40:22.008 --> 03:40:23.910
AISLE THAT STOOD UP TODAY,

03:40:23.977 --> 03:40:24.811
INCLUDING MY FRIEND FROM FRESNO

03:40:24.878 --> 03:40:27.547
THAT HAS HELD UP INDEPENDENT

03:40:27.614 --> 03:40:30.083
COMMISSIONS FOR REDISTRICTING

03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:33.053
AS THE MODEL, WHEN MY FRIEND

03:40:33.119 --> 03:40:36.323
FROM MERCED INTRODUCED AB 1441

03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:39.526
FOR INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

03:40:39.593 --> 03:40:41.394
IN HER DISTRICT, EVERY SINGLE

03:40:41.461 --> 03:40:44.164
ONE OF YOU VOTED AGAINST IT. SO

03:40:44.230 --> 03:40:47.634
SAVE IT. THIS IS ABOUT ONE

03:40:47.701 --> 03:40:49.269
THING. IT'S ABOUT ONE MAN

03:40:49.336 --> 03:40:52.339
TRYING TO CONTROL CALIFORNIA,

03:40:52.405 --> 03:40:54.908
TRYING TO CONTROL OUR COUNTRY.

03:40:54.975 --> 03:40:57.143
WE WILL NOT BEND, WE WILL NOT

03:40:57.210 --> 03:40:59.112
BREAK, AND WE WILL DO

03:40:59.179 --> 03:41:00.947
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO SAVE

03:41:01.014 --> 03:41:03.116
CALIFORNIA AND SAVE OUR COUNTRY.

03:41:03.183 --> 03:41:04.985
THIS IS ONE OF THE PROUDEST

03:41:05.051 --> 03:41:07.520
MOMENTS OF MY SHORT TERM AS A

03:41:07.587 --> 03:41:09.289
LEGISLATOR HERE. IT'S ONE OF

03:41:09.356 --> 03:41:10.123
THE EASIEST VOTES THAT I WILL

03:41:10.190 --> 03:41:13.293
TAKE, AND I WILL BE VERY PROUD

03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:14.995
WHEN THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE WHO

03:41:15.061 --> 03:41:16.997
ULTIMATELY MAKE THIS DECISION

03:41:17.063 --> 03:41:18.465
ACTUALLY HELP US SAVE OUR

03:41:18.531 --> 03:41:21.167
COUNTRY. I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.

MR. SPEAKER. THANK YOU.

03:41:22.569 --> 03:41:23.436

03:41:30.644 --> 03:41:33.313
SPEAKER. I AGREE WITH MY

03:41:33.380 --> 03:41:35.181
COLLEAGUE FROM LYNNWOOD THAT

03:41:35.248 --> 03:41:37.350
THIS IS NOT A FIGHT BETWEEN

03:41:37.417 --> 03:41:40.787
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. IN

03:41:40.854 --> 03:41:42.255
FACT, REDISTRICTING HAS NEVER

03:41:42.322 --> 03:41:45.525
BEEN A FIGHT BETWEEN POLITICAL

03:41:45.592 --> 03:41:47.027
PARTIES. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

03:41:47.093 --> 03:41:49.829
FIGHT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND

03:41:49.896 --> 03:41:51.331
POWER HUNGRY POLITICIANS AND

03:41:51.398 --> 03:41:53.166
FRIENDS. THIS DID NOT START IN

03:41:53.233 --> 03:41:57.404
TEXAS FOR OVER 200 YEARS,

03:41:57.470 --> 03:41:59.205
POLITICIANS HAVE USED

03:41:59.272 --> 03:42:01.441
GERRYMANDERING TO CHOOSE THEIR

03:42:01.508 --> 03:42:03.410
PREFERRED VOTERS, PROTECT THEIR

03:42:03.476 --> 03:42:05.645
OWN POLITICAL INTERESTS, AND

03:42:05.712 --> 03:42:07.580
AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY. AND LET'S

03:42:07.647 --> 03:42:10.283
BE CLEAR IT IS WRONG WHEN THIS

03:42:10.350 --> 03:42:13.386
IS DONE BY EITHER PARTY. IN

03:42:13.453 --> 03:42:15.355
FACT, MANY OF THE POINTS RAISED

03:42:15.422 --> 03:42:18.358
BY MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS FLOOR

03:42:18.425 --> 03:42:20.794
TODAY HIGHLIGHT THE HARMS OF

03:42:20.860 --> 03:42:22.662
PARTIZAN, GERRYMANDERING AND

03:42:22.729 --> 03:42:25.198
UNDERSCORE EXACTLY WHY

03:42:25.265 --> 03:42:26.399
POLITICIANS SHOULD NOT BE

03:42:26.466 --> 03:42:29.235
DRAWING THEIR OWN MAPS. THAT IS

03:42:29.302 --> 03:42:32.706
WHY I WAS PROUD WHEN CALIFORNIA

03:42:32.772 --> 03:42:35.575
CITIZENS CHOSE A BETTER PATH

03:42:35.642 --> 03:42:37.444
FORWARD, A SYSTEM WHERE

03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:39.679
POLITICIANS NO LONGER CHOOSE

03:42:39.746 --> 03:42:41.581
THEIR VOTERS, BUT ONE WHERE THE

03:42:41.648 --> 03:42:43.116
VOTERS GET TO CHOOSE THEIR

03:42:43.183 --> 03:42:46.653
POLITICIANS, OUR CITIZENS

03:42:46.720 --> 03:42:48.621
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION IS A

03:42:48.688 --> 03:42:50.056
MODEL FOR THE NATION AND A

03:42:50.123 --> 03:42:52.492
MODEL THAT SHOULD BE ADOPTED

03:42:52.559 --> 03:42:55.095
NATIONWIDE TO END ALL PARTIZAN

03:42:55.161 --> 03:42:57.964
GERRYMANDERING ONCE AND FOR ALL.

03:42:58.031 --> 03:42:59.065
DESPITE GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S

03:42:59.132 --> 03:43:04.070
INSISTENCE. THAT ACR ACR

03:43:04.137 --> 03:43:06.139
PRESERVES THIS MODEL, MAKE NO

03:43:06.206 --> 03:43:08.441
MISTAKE THAT IT UNDERMINES THE

03:43:08.508 --> 03:43:10.243
WILL OF THE VOTERS AND FOREVER

03:43:10.310 --> 03:43:13.012
TARNISHES CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY

03:43:13.079 --> 03:43:15.849
AS A LEADER ON INDEPENDENT

03:43:15.915 --> 03:43:17.183
REDISTRICTING. YOU ARE ALL

03:43:17.250 --> 03:43:19.252
CORRECT THAT THE VOTERS WILL

03:43:19.319 --> 03:43:22.088
GET A SAY ONCE AGAIN IF THIS

03:43:22.155 --> 03:43:24.224
PASSES TODAY, AND I TRULY

03:43:24.290 --> 03:43:26.292
BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL SEE

03:43:26.359 --> 03:43:27.293
THROUGH THIS VEILED ATTEMPT TO

03:43:27.360 --> 03:43:29.996
RETURN POWER TO THE POLITICIANS.

03:43:30.063 --> 03:43:32.732
AS OF THIS WEEK, POLLS ALREADY

03:43:32.799 --> 03:43:35.201
SHOW THAT 64% OF CALIFORNIANS

03:43:35.268 --> 03:43:37.637
DO NOT SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL

03:43:37.704 --> 03:43:41.241
BEFORE US TODAY. SO I URGE YOU

03:43:41.307 --> 03:43:43.276
TO REJECT THIS RACE TO THE

03:43:43.343 --> 03:43:45.211
BOTTOM TO STAND ON PRINCIPLE

03:43:45.278 --> 03:43:48.148
AND VOTE NO ON ACR EIGHT. THANK

03:43:48.214 --> 03:43:49.182
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER, HOOVER,

03:43:49.249 --> 03:43:51.317
ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA, YOU ARE

03:43:51.384 --> 03:43:53.086
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

03:43:53.153 --> 03:43:55.221
SPEAKER. I'M IT'S REALLY

03:43:55.288 --> 03:43:56.790
TIRESOME TO HEAR THESE

03:43:56.856 --> 03:43:59.526
SANCTIMONIOUS CRIES FROM THE

03:43:59.592 --> 03:44:03.096
OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. FOR

03:44:03.163 --> 03:44:04.497
THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND EVEN

03:44:04.564 --> 03:44:07.033
MONTHS, AS TRUMP HAS BEEN

03:44:07.100 --> 03:44:08.601
CLAMORING FOR MORE AND MORE

03:44:08.668 --> 03:44:10.003
POWER, TALKING ABOUT HAVING A

03:44:10.069 --> 03:44:12.405
THIRD TERM AND THEN VERY

03:44:12.472 --> 03:44:14.407
DIRECTLY DEMANDING SEATS BE

03:44:14.474 --> 03:44:16.709
GIVEN TO HIM THAT HE'S ENTITLED

03:44:16.776 --> 03:44:18.511
TO FROM TEXAS, WE DIDN'T HEAR

03:44:18.578 --> 03:44:20.280
OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SAY A

03:44:20.346 --> 03:44:22.615
WORD ABOUT THAT WHEN IT'S THEIR

03:44:22.682 --> 03:44:24.517
PARTY IN CONTROL OF CONGRESS,

03:44:24.584 --> 03:44:27.554
THEIR PARTY IN CONTROL OF THE

03:44:27.620 --> 03:44:28.421
WHITE HOUSE. THAT FIGHT WAS

03:44:28.488 --> 03:44:31.124
BROUGHT TO US, AND WE DIDN'T

03:44:31.191 --> 03:44:33.560
HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT

03:44:33.626 --> 03:44:35.495
REDISTRICTING AND FAIRNESS AT

03:44:35.562 --> 03:44:38.031
ALL UNTIL TODAY, WHEN IT'S

03:44:38.097 --> 03:44:40.266
BROUGHT TO OUR DOORSTEP. AND WE

03:44:40.333 --> 03:44:42.101
HAVE TO NOW STAND UP TO DEFEND

03:44:42.168 --> 03:44:45.238
OUR DEMOCRACY AGAINST A TYRANT.

03:44:45.305 --> 03:44:48.608
AND THESE CROCODILE TEARS ABOUT,

03:44:48.675 --> 03:44:51.044
OH, WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN? OH,

03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:54.314
WHAT ABOUT HEALTH CARE WHEN NOT

03:44:54.380 --> 03:44:56.316
ANY ONE OF THEM SPOKE ABOUT

03:44:56.382 --> 03:44:58.318
THIS BIG, UGLY BILL THAT WAS

03:44:58.384 --> 03:44:59.719
PASSED THAT'S GOING TO TAKE

03:44:59.786 --> 03:45:01.187
OVER $1 TRILLION AWAY FROM

03:45:01.254 --> 03:45:03.957
MEDICAID, MILLIONS IN SNAP

03:45:04.023 --> 03:45:06.192
GIVING FOOD TO CHILDREN AND

03:45:06.259 --> 03:45:09.295
SENIORS. THEY TALK ABOUT THE

03:45:09.362 --> 03:45:11.297
COST OF AN ELECTION. THEY NEVER

03:45:11.364 --> 03:45:12.665
TALK ABOUT A COST OF ELECTION.

03:45:12.732 --> 03:45:14.334
WHEN TIME AND AGAIN, THEY TRY

03:45:14.400 --> 03:45:16.502
TO RECALL THE GOVERNOR. WE

03:45:16.569 --> 03:45:18.004
DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT COST OF

03:45:18.071 --> 03:45:19.372
ELECTION THEN, BUT WE HEAR

03:45:19.439 --> 03:45:21.374
ABOUT IT NOW. WHAT IS THE COST

03:45:21.441 --> 03:45:24.110
OF ELECTION? OH, ABOUT THE COST

03:45:24.177 --> 03:45:28.214
OF ONE TRUMP BALLROOM. SO LET'S

03:45:28.281 --> 03:45:29.315
BE REAL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

03:45:29.382 --> 03:45:30.483
TALKING ABOUT. WHEN WE TALK

03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:32.018
ABOUT GETTING ON YOUR KNEES,

03:45:32.085 --> 03:45:33.119
YOU TALK ABOUT TAKING AND

03:45:33.186 --> 03:45:34.320
BENDING THE KNEE. YOU'RE

03:45:34.387 --> 03:45:36.022
BENDING THE KNEE TO A TYRANT.

03:45:36.089 --> 03:45:38.691
AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY KINGS.

03:45:38.758 --> 03:45:39.759
WE WILL HAVE NO KINGS IN

03:45:39.826 --> 03:45:42.395
AMERICA. NOT AS LONG AS

03:45:42.462 --> 03:45:44.397
CALIFORNIA EXISTS. NOT AS LONG

03:45:44.464 --> 03:45:46.165
AS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIGHT

03:45:46.232 --> 03:45:48.234
BACK. WE WILL NOT HAVE A KING.

03:45:48.301 --> 03:45:49.569
YOU ALL ARE CHOOSING YOUR

03:45:49.636 --> 03:45:52.205
SUPREME LEADER OVER YOUR OWN

03:45:52.272 --> 03:45:53.006
CONSTITUENTS. YOU'RE CHOOSING

03:45:53.072 --> 03:45:55.608
YOUR SUPREME LEADER, TRUMP,

03:45:55.675 --> 03:45:56.776
OVER CHILDREN THAT ARE GOING TO

03:45:56.843 --> 03:45:59.946
LOSE HEALTH CARE AND FOOD. YOU

03:46:00.013 --> 03:46:02.715
ARE MAKING THAT CHOICE AND WE

03:46:02.782 --> 03:46:05.184
ARE STANDING UP AGAINST IT.

03:46:05.251 --> 03:46:07.153
WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAND UP FOR

03:46:07.220 --> 03:46:09.289
TRILLIONS IN TAX CUTS FOR

03:46:09.355 --> 03:46:10.990
BILLIONAIRES. WE'RE GOING TO

03:46:11.057 --> 03:46:12.058
STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY. WE ARE

03:46:12.125 --> 03:46:14.994
GOING TO GO DOWN FIGHTING FOR

03:46:15.061 --> 03:46:17.330
OUR DEMOCRACY, AND WE'LL LET

03:46:17.397 --> 03:46:18.331
YOU BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF

03:46:18.398 --> 03:46:21.000
HISTORY. REPUBLICANS, THANK YOU,

03:46:21.067 --> 03:46:24.237
ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. MEMBERS,

03:46:24.304 --> 03:46:26.072
THIS IS THE SECOND AND FINAL

03:46:26.139 --> 03:46:28.574
REQUEST. ANYONE WHO WISHES TO

03:46:28.641 --> 03:46:29.042
SPEAK MUST RAISE THEIR

03:46:29.108 --> 03:46:31.878
MICROPHONE. NOW. THEY DO NOT

03:46:31.945 --> 03:46:39.218
WILL NOT BE RECOGNIZED. SPEAKER

03:46:39.285 --> 03:46:42.989
RIVAS, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED WELL.

03:46:43.056 --> 03:46:46.125
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. PRO TEM,

03:46:46.192 --> 03:46:49.028
QUITE THE YEAR WE HAVE HAD HERE

03:46:49.095 --> 03:46:55.234
IN 2025. I'M PROUD OF THIS

03:46:55.301 --> 03:46:58.004
CHAMBER. I'M PROUD OF MY

03:46:58.071 --> 03:47:01.874
COLLEAGUES. COURAGE. PRESIDENT

03:47:01.941 --> 03:47:04.744
TRUMP WANTS US TO BE

03:47:04.811 --> 03:47:07.113
INTIMIDATED. AND HIS PLAYBOOK

03:47:07.180 --> 03:47:12.018
IS A SIMPLE ONE. BULLY,

03:47:12.085 --> 03:47:16.689
THREATEN AND SILENCE, THEN RIG

03:47:16.756 --> 03:47:21.027
THE RULES TO HANG ON TO POWER.

03:47:21.094 --> 03:47:24.263
AND WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE

03:47:24.330 --> 03:47:27.500
CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE A

03:47:27.567 --> 03:47:29.702
BYSTANDER TO THAT POWER GRAB.

03:47:29.769 --> 03:47:32.739
WE ARE NOT INTIMIDATED AND WE

03:47:32.805 --> 03:47:37.577
ARE ACTING OPENLY, LAWFULLY,

03:47:37.643 --> 03:47:40.113
WITH PURPOSE AND RESOLVE TO

03:47:40.179 --> 03:47:42.749
DEFEND OUR STATE AND TO DEFEND

03:47:42.815 --> 03:47:48.021
OUR DEMOCRACY. AND LOOK, DONALD

03:47:48.087 --> 03:47:51.124
TRUMP, HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN

03:47:51.190 --> 03:47:55.862
DEMOCRACY. HE IS TERRIFIED OF

03:47:55.928 --> 03:47:58.197
LOSING. AND HE WILL DO WHATEVER

03:47:58.264 --> 03:48:02.835
IT TAKES TO CLING ON TO POWER.

03:48:02.902 --> 03:48:06.105
WE SAW THIS ON JANUARY 6TH WHEN

03:48:06.172 --> 03:48:09.409
HE UNLEASHED A VIOLENT MOB ON

03:48:09.475 --> 03:48:12.979
OUR NATION'S CAPITOL, AND HE

03:48:13.046 --> 03:48:15.415
DID THIS TO OVERTURN AN

03:48:15.481 --> 03:48:20.053
ELECTION. WE SAW IT YESTERDAY

03:48:20.119 --> 03:48:23.589
IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, WHERE

03:48:23.656 --> 03:48:25.124
REPUBLICANS ADVANCED A

03:48:25.191 --> 03:48:28.027
MID-DECADE MAP DESIGNED TO FLIP

03:48:28.094 --> 03:48:31.230
UP TO FIVE CONGRESSIONAL SEATS

03:48:31.297 --> 03:48:33.066
AND LOCK IN A PARTIZAN EDGE IN

03:48:33.132 --> 03:48:34.734
THE U.S. HOUSE OF

03:48:34.801 --> 03:48:37.770
REPRESENTATIVES. AT PRESIDENT

03:48:37.837 --> 03:48:42.508
TRUMP'S ORDER. AGAIN, THIS IS

03:48:42.575 --> 03:48:45.711
THE SAME DANGEROUS PLAYBOOK. IF

03:48:45.778 --> 03:48:49.182
TRUMP CAN'T WIN FAIRLY, HE'LL

03:48:49.248 --> 03:48:52.218
TRY TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

03:48:52.285 --> 03:48:57.490
REPUBLICANS TO LOSE. AND WHY?

03:48:57.557 --> 03:49:00.026
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP KNOWS WHAT

03:49:00.093 --> 03:49:04.464
WE KNOW. VOTERS ARE READY TO

03:49:04.530 --> 03:49:06.065
HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE. FROM

03:49:06.132 --> 03:49:08.034
CALIFORNIA TO NEW YORK, FROM

03:49:08.101 --> 03:49:12.205
NORTH TO SOUTH. BUT OF COURSE,

03:49:12.271 --> 03:49:14.240
PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE DOESN'T

03:49:14.307 --> 03:49:16.309
WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:49:16.375 --> 03:49:18.244
HIS FAILURES IN AN ELECTION,

03:49:18.311 --> 03:49:21.347
ESPECIALLY THE NEXT ONE. AND

03:49:21.414 --> 03:49:23.416
THAT'S WHY HE IS TRYING TO RIG

03:49:23.483 --> 03:49:25.918
IT. AND, OF COURSE, OUR

03:49:25.985 --> 03:49:28.387
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN THIS

03:49:28.454 --> 03:49:30.389
CHAMBER DON'T WANT THEIR PARTY

03:49:30.456 --> 03:49:33.793
TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY

03:49:33.860 --> 03:49:34.994
VOTERS, AND CERTAINLY NOT IN

03:49:35.061 --> 03:49:37.096
CALIFORNIA, ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:49:37.163 --> 03:49:41.334
RIPPING AWAY 1.2 $5,000,000,000

03:49:41.400 --> 03:49:43.336

03:49:45.538 --> 03:49:47.540
HUNGRY CHILDREN, OUR MOST

03:49:47.607 --> 03:49:50.810
VULNERABLE FAMILIES.

03:49:50.877 --> 03:49:52.578
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MILLIONS OF

03:49:52.645 --> 03:49:54.814
CALIFORNIANS WHO WILL LOSE

03:49:54.881 --> 03:49:55.348
THEIR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE

03:49:55.414 --> 03:49:59.352
BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT.

03:49:59.418 --> 03:50:00.953
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CUTS TO OUR

03:50:01.020 --> 03:50:04.690

REQUIRE THE PROPOSED

04:01:45.357 --> 04:01:46.892

EIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT PUTTING

04:02:18.457 --> 04:02:19.324
PEOPLE OVER POLITICS. RUSHING

04:02:19.391 --> 04:02:21.393
THROUGH MAPS WITHOUT SCRUTINY

04:02:21.460 --> 04:02:23.262

CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF 131

04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:32.804
OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND GIVE

04:02:32.871 --> 04:02:35.007
CITIZENS AMPLE TIME TO REVIEW

04:02:35.073 --> 04:02:36.208

04:02:36.275 --> 04:02:38.343
BOUNDARIES. WE CAN'T IGNORE.

04:02:38.410 --> 04:02:39.144
THE STARK CONTRAST THE

04:02:39.211 --> 04:02:40.245
COMMISSION'S INDEPENDENT,

04:02:40.312 --> 04:02:42.514
PUBLIC DRIVEN APPROACH HAS

04:02:42.581 --> 04:02:44.049
DELIVERED FAIR REPRESENTATION,

04:02:44.116 --> 04:02:45.584
BUT THIS LEGISLATIVE PUSH

04:02:45.651 --> 04:02:47.519
SPARKED BY OTHER POLITICS

04:02:47.586 --> 04:02:49.621
THREATENS TO DRAG CALIFORNIA

04:02:49.688 --> 04:02:51.490
INTO REDISTRICTING WARS THAT

04:02:51.556 --> 04:02:52.324
PRIORITIZE PARTY POWER OVER

04:02:52.391 --> 04:02:55.627
PEOPLE. THE INDEPENDENT

04:02:55.694 --> 04:02:56.228
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

04:02:56.295 --> 04:02:57.963
COMMISSION HELD OVER 100,

04:02:58.030 --> 04:03:00.132
ACTUALLY OVER 200 MEETINGS AND

04:03:00.198 --> 04:03:01.400
WELCOMED EXTENSIVE INPUT FROM

04:03:01.466 --> 04:03:02.935
VOTERS ON THE COMMUNITIES AND

04:03:03.001 --> 04:03:05.103
NEEDS, ENSURING A THOROUGH AND

04:03:05.170 --> 04:03:06.538
TRANSPARENT PROCESS. THESE

04:03:06.605 --> 04:03:08.073
AMENDMENTS TO SB 280 ARE

04:03:08.140 --> 04:03:09.441
ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT THERE

04:03:09.508 --> 04:03:12.477
IS ENOUGH INPUT AND REVIEW TIME

04:03:12.544 --> 04:03:13.312
FOR VOTERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

04:03:13.378 --> 04:03:15.580
THEY ARE VOTING ON. THIS IS A

04:03:15.647 --> 04:03:17.316
VERY COMPLEX MATTER. THESE ARE

04:03:17.382 --> 04:03:20.385
VERY INTRICATE MAPS THAT COVER

04:03:20.452 --> 04:03:22.387
THE ENTIRE STATE, AND PEOPLE

04:03:22.454 --> 04:03:23.422
NEED TO KNOW WHAT COMMUNITIES

04:03:23.488 --> 04:03:24.923
HAVE BEEN SPLIT, WHAT

04:03:24.990 --> 04:03:26.291
COMMUNITIES HAVE, WHAT COUNTIES

04:03:26.358 --> 04:03:28.994
HAVE BEEN SPLIT OUT, WHAT WHAT

04:03:29.061 --> 04:03:30.062
THEIR REPRESENTATION WILL

04:03:30.128 --> 04:03:32.097
ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. SO GIVING

04:03:32.164 --> 04:03:33.365
CALIFORNIANS THAT TIME THAT

04:03:33.432 --> 04:03:35.167
THEY DESERVED, MUCH LIKE THEY

04:03:35.233 --> 04:03:37.102

04:03:37.169 --> 04:03:38.003
EXHAUSTIVE PROCESS, HELPS

TODAY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA VOTERS

CREATED THE CITIZENS

04:06:07.352 --> 04:06:08.086
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION FOR

04:06:08.153 --> 04:06:10.188
ONE CLEAR PURPOSE TO TAKE THE

04:06:10.255 --> 04:06:12.023
POWER OF DRAWING DISTRICT LINES

04:06:12.090 --> 04:06:14.326
AWAY FROM POLITICIANS AND

RETURN IT TO THE PEOPLE. YET

04:06:17.129 --> 04:06:19.164
GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND DEMOCRAT

04:06:19.231 --> 04:06:20.398

REDRAW OUR MAPS WITHOUT

04:06:24.302 --> 04:06:27.105
WHAT WE SEE BEFORE US TODAY IS

04:06:27.172 --> 04:06:29.508
EXACTLY THE KIND OF

GERRYMANDERING CALIFORNIANS

04:06:30.142 --> 04:06:32.077

COMMISSION REMAINS TRULY

04:06:42.220 --> 04:06:44.089

COMMISSIONERS ABOUT DISTRICT

04:06:49.261 --> 04:06:52.964
LINES. WE CLOSE THE DOOR TO

04:06:53.031 --> 04:06:55.133
BACKROOM DEALS AND UNETHICAL

04:06:55.200 --> 04:06:57.235
POLITICS. POLITICAL PRESSURE.

04:06:57.302 --> 04:06:59.104
IF REDISTRICTING IS TO HAPPEN,

04:06:59.171 --> 04:07:00.372
IT SHOULD HAPPEN ON THE MERITS

04:07:00.438 --> 04:07:02.140
OF THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE, NOT

04:07:02.207 --> 04:07:04.709
BECAUSE POWERFUL POLITICIANS

04:07:04.776 --> 04:07:07.045
WHISPERED IN THE EAR OF THE

04:07:07.112 --> 04:07:08.246
COMMISSION. THIS IS SIMPLY

04:07:08.313 --> 04:07:10.382
ABOUT TRUST. THE PUBLIC

04:07:10.448 --> 04:07:12.217
DESERVES TO KNOW WHAT THE MAPS

04:07:12.284 --> 04:07:14.352
THEY LIVE UNDER ARE DRAWN

04:07:14.419 --> 04:07:17.355
FAIRLY, NOT NOT MANIPULATED FOR

04:07:17.422 --> 04:07:19.057
PARTIZAN ADVANTAGE. WE STAND

04:07:19.124 --> 04:07:22.027
HERE AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES

WERE SENT HERE TO PROTECT THE

04:07:26.765 --> 04:07:28.033
WILL OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS.

04:07:28.099 --> 04:07:30.302
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

04:07:30.368 --> 04:07:32.037
TEXAS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

04:07:32.103 --> 04:07:34.072

280 TO MAKE THAT THE CASE. AND

04:09:07.165 --> 04:09:09.200
TRULY, IF THE DEBATE THAT WE

04:09:09.267 --> 04:09:10.935
JUST HEARD IS TRUE, THAT WE

04:09:11.002 --> 04:09:12.237
HAVE TO DO THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT

04:09:12.304 --> 04:09:14.339
TEXAS IS DOING. AND BY THE WAY,

04:09:14.406 --> 04:09:16.107
ONE HOUSE HAS PASSED THE

04:09:16.174 --> 04:09:17.375
REDISTRICTING MEASURE. ANOTHER

04:09:17.442 --> 04:09:19.377
HOUSE STILL HAS TO PASS IT. THE

04:09:19.444 --> 04:09:21.713
GOVERNOR WOULD STILL HAVE TO

04:09:21.780 --> 04:09:23.281
SIGN IT IN TEXAS, PUT THE

04:09:23.348 --> 04:09:26.651
CONDITION IN IN THE BILL. IF

04:09:26.718 --> 04:09:27.285
IT'S TRULY ABOUT TEXAS AND

04:09:27.352 --> 04:09:29.054
YOU'RE COUNTERING WHAT TEXAS IS

04:09:29.120 --> 04:09:32.557
DOING, THEN THERE SHOULD BE A

04:09:32.624 --> 04:09:33.425
CONDITION ON THIS ACA AND THIS

04:09:33.491 --> 04:09:35.160
MEASURE GOING FORWARD. IF YOU

04:09:35.226 --> 04:09:37.028
TRULY BELIEVE THAT, THEN YOU

04:09:37.095 --> 04:09:39.064
SHOULD SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT.

04:09:39.130 --> 04:09:41.833
AND THAT'S AGAIN ANOTHER SIMPLE,

04:09:41.900 --> 04:09:42.400
REASONABLE AMENDMENT. I AM

04:09:42.467 --> 04:09:44.969

SUPPORT IT AND PUT YOUR MONEY

04:09:47.405 --> 04:09:49.874

04:13:57.121 --> 04:13:58.423
WELL-TRAINED, DEDICATED GROUP

04:13:58.489 --> 04:14:01.359

HAVE RISEN TO EVERY CHALLENGE.

04:14:20.578 --> 04:14:23.047
A SPECIAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER

04:14:23.114 --> 04:14:25.783
WILL DEMAND EXTRAORDINARY

04:14:25.850 --> 04:14:27.018
EFFORT AND RESOURCES, BUT I

04:14:27.085 --> 04:14:30.221

UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR

04:14:33.825 --> 04:14:36.060
SECRETARY OF STATE AND HER TEAM,

04:14:36.127 --> 04:14:37.261
THEY WILL ONCE AGAIN ENSURE

CONDUCTING THIS SPECIAL

04:14:55.146 --> 04:14:56.714
ELECTION. THIS PROVISION WAS

04:14:56.781 --> 04:14:57.982
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME,

04:14:58.049 --> 04:15:00.418
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

04:15:00.485 --> 04:15:03.021
FOR COUNTIES OF ALL SIZES TO

QUICKLY TOUCH ON THE ISSUE OF

04:15:05.256 --> 04:15:06.491
COSTS. I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN

04:15:06.557 --> 04:15:08.026
CONCERN FROM SOME OF MY

04:15:08.092 --> 04:15:09.127
COLLEAGUES THAT HAVING THIS

04:15:09.193 --> 04:15:10.328
SPECIAL ELECTION IS NOT THE

04:15:10.395 --> 04:15:12.997
BEST USE OF STATE DOLLARS.

04:15:13.064 --> 04:15:15.566
WHATEVER IT COSTS TO CONDUCT

04:15:15.633 --> 04:15:18.169
THIS SPECIAL ELECTION PALES IN

04:15:18.236 --> 04:15:20.004
COMPARISON TO THE MASSIVE

04:15:20.071 --> 04:15:22.540
ECONOMIC HARM BY TRUMP ON OUR

04:15:22.607 --> 04:15:25.076
STATE. WE'VE HEARD MANY PEOPLE

04:15:25.143 --> 04:15:27.779
SPEAK OF IT TODAY. HIS TARIFFS

04:15:27.845 --> 04:15:28.713
HAVE FUELED HIGHER PRICES.

04:15:28.780 --> 04:15:31.082
FAMILIES ARE PAYING MORE AT THE

04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:32.216
GROCERY STORE, AND YET HE IS

04:15:32.283 --> 04:15:33.818
SLASHING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

04:15:33.885 --> 04:15:36.921

735,000 CALIFORNIANS AT RISK OF

NEARLY A TRILLION FROM MEDICAID

04:15:44.395 --> 04:15:47.699
TO PAY FOR TAX BREAKS FOR

04:15:47.765 --> 04:15:48.299

CALIFORNIANS ON THE LINE. AND

04:15:53.137 --> 04:15:55.273
HE'S HOLDING BACK NEARLY $1

04:15:55.339 --> 04:15:57.542
BILLION FOR OUR K THROUGH 12

04:15:57.608 --> 04:16:00.912

DETENTIONS AND DEPORTATIONS

04:16:02.647 --> 04:16:04.916
WILL COST THE STATE BILLIONS OF

04:16:04.982 --> 04:16:07.185
DOLLARS AND ELIMINATE $23

04:16:07.251 --> 04:16:10.021
BILLION IN TAX REVENUES.

04:16:10.088 --> 04:16:11.889
TRUMP'S POLICIES SLASHED

04:16:28.606 --> 04:16:31.242
VULNERABLE. THE LIST GOES ON.

04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:33.177
TRUMP'S POLICIES DON'T JUST

04:16:33.244 --> 04:16:37.648
HURT OUR ECONOMY, THEY HURT OUR

04:16:37.715 --> 04:16:39.250
FAMILIES, OUR SCHOOLS, OUR

04:16:39.317 --> 04:16:43.421
HEALTH AND OUR FUTURE. THAT IS

04:16:43.488 --> 04:16:45.990
THE DEMOCRACY WE ARE FIGHTING

04:16:46.057 --> 04:16:48.893
FOR. IT'S THE PEOPLE. A

04:16:48.960 --> 04:16:52.530
GOVERNMENT OF, FOR AND BY THE

04:16:52.597 --> 04:16:56.067
PEOPLE. THE COST OF THIS

04:16:56.134 --> 04:16:57.502
ELECTION IS PENNIES COMPARED TO

04:16:57.568 --> 04:16:58.469
THE PRICE CALIFORNIANS ARE

04:16:58.536 --> 04:17:00.138
ALREADY PAYING FOR TRUMP'S

04:17:00.204 --> 04:17:03.975
FAILED POLICIES. BUT ULTIMATELY,

04:17:04.041 --> 04:17:05.576
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE TO

04:17:05.643 --> 04:17:07.678
SPEND A SINGLE DIME ON THIS

04:17:07.745 --> 04:17:09.480
SPECIAL ELECTION. OUR STATE'S

04:17:09.547 --> 04:17:11.215
REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVES IN

04:17:11.282 --> 04:17:12.984
CONGRESS CAN MARCH OVER TO THE

04:17:13.050 --> 04:17:14.585
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW, PICK UP

04:17:14.652 --> 04:17:16.254
THE PHONE, ORGANIZE THEMSELVES,

04:17:16.320 --> 04:17:17.121
AND TELL THE PRESIDENT TO STOP

04:17:17.188 --> 04:17:19.557
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TEXAS

04:17:19.624 --> 04:17:22.026
RIGHT NOW. HIS GRAB FOR FIVE

04:17:22.093 --> 04:17:24.162
SEATS THAT HE THINKS HE IS

04:17:24.228 --> 04:17:27.165
ENTITLED TO, AND THEY BETTER

04:17:27.231 --> 04:17:29.500
ACT FAST BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

04:17:29.567 --> 04:17:30.134
MAP HAS BEEN PASSED BY THE

04:17:30.201 --> 04:17:32.103
HOUSE, AND IT'S GOING TO THE

04:17:32.170 --> 04:17:34.372
SENATE TODAY. AS LONG AS THIS

04:17:34.438 --> 04:17:36.174
PRESIDENT THINKS HE'S ENTITLED

04:17:36.240 --> 04:17:38.342
TO MORE REPUBLICAN SEATS IN

04:17:38.409 --> 04:17:41.345
CONGRESS, REGARDLESS OF HOW THE

04:17:41.412 --> 04:17:43.948
PEOPLE VOTE, AND AS LONG AS

04:17:44.015 --> 04:17:45.216
REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS NATIONALLY

04:17:45.283 --> 04:17:47.618
ARE UNWILLING TO STAND UP AND

04:17:47.685 --> 04:17:49.554
TO FIGHT FOR AND TO PRESERVE

04:17:49.620 --> 04:17:52.456
OUR DEMOCRACY, THEN CALIFORNIA

04:17:52.523 --> 04:17:54.358
MUST GIVE VOTERS THIS

04:17:54.425 --> 04:17:56.894
OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE WHETHER

04:17:56.961 --> 04:17:59.096
TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THESE

04:17:59.163 --> 04:18:01.165
AUTHORITARIAN TACTICS BY

04:18:01.232 --> 04:18:03.034
APPROVING THE USE OF THESE

04:18:03.100 --> 04:18:04.669
TEMPORARY CONGRESSIONAL

04:18:04.735 --> 04:18:07.205
DISTRICT MAPS. I RESPECTFULLY

04:18:07.271 --> 04:18:09.907
ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB 280.

04:18:09.974 --> 04:18:11.475
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:18:11.542 --> 04:18:12.343
PELLERIN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:18:12.410 --> 04:18:14.946
DEMAIO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MR.

04:18:15.012 --> 04:18:17.048
SPEAKER, PERMISSION TO USE A

04:18:17.114 --> 04:18:19.317
PROP? WE'RE NOT ALLOWING PROPS

04:18:19.383 --> 04:18:20.051
TODAY, MR. DEMAIO. THEN WHY

04:18:20.117 --> 04:18:22.153
HAVE YOU BECOME PROPS TO

04:18:22.220 --> 04:18:23.754
GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM'S

04:18:23.821 --> 04:18:26.390
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN? THAT IS

04:18:26.457 --> 04:18:29.193
WHAT SB 280 IS AN UNNECESSARY

04:18:29.260 --> 04:18:32.563
SPECIAL ELECTION AT A COST OF A

04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:33.998
QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS. WHY?

04:18:34.065 --> 04:18:36.234
BECAUSE HIS CAMPAIGN FOR

04:18:36.300 --> 04:18:37.969
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN GOING DOWN

04:18:38.035 --> 04:18:39.136
IN FLAMES, AND HE NEEDS

04:18:39.203 --> 04:18:42.240
SOMETHING TO PROP UP HIS

04:18:42.306 --> 04:18:45.109
CHANCES. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT

04:18:45.176 --> 04:18:47.345
IT, THIS IS A POLITICAL STUNT.

04:18:47.411 --> 04:18:50.214
AN UNNECESSARY, COSTLY SPECIAL

04:18:50.281 --> 04:18:52.450
ELECTION BECAUSE GAVIN NEWSOM

04:18:52.516 --> 04:18:54.986
NEEDS CHUM IN THE WATER FOR

04:18:55.052 --> 04:18:57.188
POLITICAL ATTENTION. YOU KNOW

04:18:57.255 --> 04:18:59.991
IT AND I KNOW IT. AND YOU'RE

04:19:00.057 --> 04:19:01.092
ALLOWING STATE TAXPAYER MONEY

04:19:01.158 --> 04:19:05.263
TO BE USED FOR IT. MY FRIENDS

04:19:05.329 --> 04:19:08.933
ACROSS THE AISLE SAY THAT THIS

04:19:09.000 --> 04:19:12.703
IS NO MORE THAN A SPECIAL

04:19:12.770 --> 04:19:15.006
ELECTION LIKE THE RECALL WAS IN

04:19:15.072 --> 04:19:16.707
2021. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

04:19:16.774 --> 04:19:18.342
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. THE

04:19:18.409 --> 04:19:21.679
RECALL IN 2021 WAS A CITIZEN'S

04:19:21.746 --> 04:19:24.081
RIGHT. YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH IT.

04:19:24.148 --> 04:19:26.150
I KNOW YOU ALL LIKELY VOTED

04:19:26.217 --> 04:19:28.686
AGAINST IT, BUT IT IS A RIGHT

04:19:28.753 --> 04:19:30.221
OF THE CITIZENS TO COLLECT

04:19:30.288 --> 04:19:31.522
SIGNATURES AND PLACE ITEMS ON

04:19:31.589 --> 04:19:32.990
THE BALLOT AND TRIGGER A

04:19:33.057 --> 04:19:35.192
SPECIAL ELECTION. IF YOU FELT

04:19:35.259 --> 04:19:37.094
THAT THIS WAS NECESSARY TO

04:19:37.161 --> 04:19:39.297
OVERTURN THE 2010 CITIZENS

04:19:39.363 --> 04:19:41.032
INITIATIVE THAT TOOK THE POWER

04:19:41.098 --> 04:19:43.734
OUT OF YOUR HANDS TO MANIPULATE

04:19:43.801 --> 04:19:44.936
LINES, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

04:19:45.002 --> 04:19:47.204
DOING HERE. THAT'S WHAT A EIGHT

04:19:47.271 --> 04:19:49.941
DOES, TAKES THE POWER AWAY FROM

04:19:50.007 --> 04:19:51.175
THE CITIZENS COMMISSION, AND

04:19:51.242 --> 04:19:52.276
GIVES IT RIGHT BACK TO THE

04:19:52.343 --> 04:19:54.078
POLITICIANS SO THEY CAN DO WHAT

04:19:54.145 --> 04:19:56.113
THEY'VE DONE FOR THE LAST 72

04:19:56.180 --> 04:19:57.915
HOURS, GO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

04:19:57.982 --> 04:19:59.917
AND MANIPULATE MAPS AND DRAW

04:19:59.984 --> 04:20:01.852
LINES AND FASHION CONGRESSIONAL

04:20:01.919 --> 04:20:03.521
DISTRICTS FOR THEMSELVES OR

04:20:03.587 --> 04:20:05.156
THEIR FRIENDS. IN THE FUTURE.

04:20:05.222 --> 04:20:07.425
IF YOU WANTED TO DO ALL THAT,

04:20:07.491 --> 04:20:09.360
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE A

04:20:09.427 --> 04:20:11.162
CITIZENS INITIATIVE CAMPAIGN.

04:20:11.228 --> 04:20:12.029
YOU SHOULD HAVE COLLECTED YOUR

04:20:12.096 --> 04:20:13.531
SIGNATURES LIKE THE RECALL

04:20:13.597 --> 04:20:16.133
BACKERS DID, BUT YOU DIDN'T

04:20:16.200 --> 04:20:18.336
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM

04:20:18.402 --> 04:20:21.839
SPENDING PRECIOUS SCARCE STATE

04:20:21.906 --> 04:20:23.040
TAX DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE OF A

04:20:23.107 --> 04:20:26.944
BUDGET CRISIS. YOU SAY THAT WE

04:20:27.011 --> 04:20:29.113
HAVE TO DEFEND DOLLARS FOR

04:20:29.180 --> 04:20:30.381
CALIFORNIA, BUT YOU HAVE

04:20:30.448 --> 04:20:32.149
WANTONLY WASTED MONEY. FOR

04:20:32.216 --> 04:20:33.918
EXAMPLE, GIVING FREE HEALTH

04:20:33.985 --> 04:20:36.354
CARE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AT

04:20:36.420 --> 04:20:37.254
THE COST OF $10 BILLION AND

04:20:37.321 --> 04:20:42.526
COUNTING. $250 MILLION APPLIED

04:20:42.593 --> 04:20:44.962
TO OUR STATE BUDGET MAY NOT

04:20:45.029 --> 04:20:46.864
MAKE UP FOR YOUR

04:20:46.931 --> 04:20:48.666
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR DEFICIT,

04:20:48.733 --> 04:20:50.134
BUT IT'S A START. YOU KNOW WHAT

04:20:50.201 --> 04:20:52.069
$250 MILLION WOULD DO? IT WOULD

04:20:52.136 --> 04:20:54.138
FULLY FUND PROP 36 SO THAT WE

04:20:54.205 --> 04:20:56.841
COULD GIVE POWER AND TOOLS TO

04:20:56.907 --> 04:20:59.410
THE PROSECUTOR, PROSECUTORS AND

04:20:59.477 --> 04:21:01.178
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO

04:21:01.245 --> 04:21:03.748
ARREST AND PUNISH CRIMINALS.

04:21:03.814 --> 04:21:06.017
VOTERS VOTED FOR PROP 36, BUT

04:21:06.083 --> 04:21:09.120
YOU REFUSE TO FUND IT FROM THE

04:21:09.186 --> 04:21:11.589
PARTY THAT SAYS, LET THE VOTERS

04:21:11.655 --> 04:21:13.057
DECIDE AND LET'S DO WHAT THE

04:21:13.124 --> 04:21:15.059
VOTERS WANT. BALONEY. YOU DO

04:21:15.126 --> 04:21:18.262
WHAT YOU WANT MIGHT MAKES RIGHT.

04:21:18.329 --> 04:21:20.064
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE

04:21:20.131 --> 04:21:21.565
DONE FOR THE LAST 72 HOURS BY

04:21:21.632 --> 04:21:23.934
TRAMPLING OVER CONSTITUTIONAL

04:21:24.001 --> 04:21:25.269
PROVISIONS AND VIOLATING HOUSE

04:21:25.336 --> 04:21:28.973
RULES. AND YOU TALK ABOUT A

04:21:29.040 --> 04:21:33.310
FAIR ELECTION, SB 2080 SHORTENS

04:21:33.377 --> 04:21:35.146
THE TIMELINE NECESSARY FOR AN

04:21:35.212 --> 04:21:36.247
ELECTION. BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE

04:21:36.313 --> 04:21:39.316
AN URGENCY CLAUSE, THERE MIGHT

04:21:39.383 --> 04:21:41.452
MAKES RIGHT. YOU CHANGE

04:21:41.519 --> 04:21:43.254
ELECTION LAW, AND NOW YOU'RE

04:21:43.320 --> 04:21:45.289
GOING TO SLAP A MISLEADING

04:21:45.356 --> 04:21:47.291
BALLOT TITLE ON. YOU CAN'T EVEN

04:21:47.358 --> 04:21:49.126
WIN BASED ON THE TRUTH. YOU SAY

04:21:49.193 --> 04:21:50.027
YOU TRUST THE VOTERS, BUT YOU

04:21:50.094 --> 04:21:52.163
DON'T TRUST THEM ENOUGH TO TELL

04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:53.230

EVISCERATING THAT COMMISSION.

04:22:12.183 --> 04:22:13.350
YOU ARE NULLIFYING THAT

04:22:13.417 --> 04:22:15.119

POWER BACK FOR YOURSELF. AND

TEMPORARY. YOU KNOW DARN WELL

04:22:25.162 --> 04:22:26.664
THAT THIS IS PERMANENT. YOU

04:22:26.730 --> 04:22:28.199
WILL NEVER GIVE THE POWER BACK

04:22:28.265 --> 04:22:30.468
TO THE PEOPLE ONCE YOU SEIZE IT

04:22:30.534 --> 04:22:33.604

DID YOU DO THAT WITH PROP 36 BY

04:22:39.844 --> 04:22:40.978
FULLY FUNDING IT? NO. DID YOU

04:22:41.045 --> 04:22:42.279
RESPECT THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE

04:22:42.346 --> 04:22:44.348
WHO PUT ARTICLE 21 IN OUR STATE

CONSTITUTION AND SAID, YOU

SHOULDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

04:22:47.284 --> 04:22:48.986
DRAW MAPS, YOU'RE DRAWING A MAP

04:22:49.053 --> 04:22:51.122
IN VIOLATION OF THE STATE

04:22:51.188 --> 04:22:52.289
CONSTITUTION. YOU DON'T CARE

04:22:52.356 --> 04:22:54.091
ABOUT WHAT THE VOTERS SAID.

04:22:54.158 --> 04:22:55.159
YOU'RE DISREGARDING IT FROM

04:22:55.226 --> 04:22:57.328
2010 Þ, BUT THEY'LL

04:22:57.394 --> 04:22:59.363

YOU, MR. DEMAIO. MR. DEMAIO,

04:23:12.009 --> 04:23:13.978
THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY. I WAS SO

04:23:14.044 --> 04:23:15.880
TEMPTED TO RECOGNIZE BIRTHDAYS,

04:23:15.946 --> 04:23:18.649
BUT I REFRAINED. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

04:23:18.716 --> 04:23:23.053
GALLAGHER, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

04:23:25.823 --> 04:23:28.058
IN OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW THE

04:23:28.125 --> 04:23:30.327
SCRIPTURE THAT I QUOTED EARLIER

04:23:30.394 --> 04:23:31.095
ABOUT TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK?

04:23:31.162 --> 04:23:33.631
IT IS A HARD WORD. IT'S A HARD

04:23:33.697 --> 04:23:35.432
WORD FOR ME, BECAUSE ALL THIS

04:23:35.499 --> 04:23:37.801
WEEK, ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS

04:23:37.868 --> 04:23:41.705
FIGHT BACK. AND WHEN YOU SEE

04:23:41.772 --> 04:23:42.306
SOMETHING YOU THINK IS WRONG,

04:23:42.373 --> 04:23:43.574
THAT'S YOUR IMMEDIATE GUT

04:23:43.641 --> 04:23:46.677
REACTION. BUT THAT SCRIPTURE IS

04:23:46.744 --> 04:23:48.445
FOR ME AND IT'S FOR EVERYONE IN

04:23:48.512 --> 04:23:53.951
THIS ROOM. AND IT MAY BE HARD,

04:23:54.018 --> 04:23:56.153
IT MAY GO AGAINST THE GRAIN,

04:23:56.220 --> 04:23:57.154
BUT IT IS NONETHELESS

04:23:57.221 --> 04:24:00.157
NONETHELESS TRUE. AND I THINK

04:24:00.224 --> 04:24:01.992
WHAT IS ALSO TRUE IS THAT WE

04:24:02.059 --> 04:24:05.129
HAVE TO STOP SAYING THAT OUR

04:24:05.196 --> 04:24:06.363
DEMOCRACY IS IN PERIL. AND LET

04:24:06.430 --> 04:24:08.299
ME TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT

04:24:08.365 --> 04:24:10.201
MORE. I'VE BEEN HEARING THAT

04:24:10.267 --> 04:24:12.036
SINCE I WAS IN COLLEGE. I

04:24:12.102 --> 04:24:14.171
REMEMBER WHEN GEORGE W BUSH WON

04:24:14.238 --> 04:24:16.207
THE ELECTION AND THAT WAS ALL

04:24:16.273 --> 04:24:18.342
YOU WOULD HEAR. OH MY GOD, OUR

04:24:18.409 --> 04:24:20.177
DEMOCRACY IS OVER. HE'S A

04:24:20.244 --> 04:24:22.146
WARMONGER. ALL THESE OUTLANDISH

04:24:22.213 --> 04:24:24.014
STATEMENTS THAT WE MAKE ABOUT

04:24:24.081 --> 04:24:27.551
OUR OPPONENT'S RIGHT TO GIN UP

04:24:27.618 --> 04:24:32.256
THE BASE, TO MAKE TO FURTHER

04:24:32.323 --> 04:24:34.358
POLARIZATION. IT REALLY STARTED

04:24:34.425 --> 04:24:36.227
EVEN BACK THEN ON MY SIDE, WHEN

04:24:36.293 --> 04:24:38.062
OBAMA GOT ELECTED. OH MY GOD,

04:24:38.128 --> 04:24:40.397
OUR DEMOCRACY IS OVER. YOU KNOW,

04:24:40.464 --> 04:24:42.533
HE'S A COMMUNIST PLANT. HE'S

04:24:42.600 --> 04:24:43.267
PROBABLY GOING TO BRING ABOUT

04:24:43.334 --> 04:24:46.570
COMMUNISM, RIGHT? TO GIN UP THE

04:24:46.637 --> 04:24:50.441
BASE. RIGHT. AND THEN OF COURSE,

04:24:50.507 --> 04:24:51.775
WHEN TRUMP GOT ELECTED Þ, OUR

04:24:51.842 --> 04:24:53.210
DEMOCRACY IS OVER. AND YET WE

04:24:53.277 --> 04:24:56.347
HAD AN ELECTION, RIGHT? AND JOE

04:24:56.413 --> 04:24:58.415
BIDEN WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT.

04:24:58.482 --> 04:25:00.251
IMAGINE THAT. OUR DEMOCRACY

04:25:00.317 --> 04:25:02.019
WASN'T OVER. RIGHT. AND OF

04:25:02.086 --> 04:25:04.288
COURSE, ON OUR SIDE, A LOT OF

04:25:04.355 --> 04:25:06.156
PEOPLE UPSET AS WELL. WE DIDN'T

04:25:06.223 --> 04:25:07.992
LIKE WHAT JOE BIDEN WAS DOING.

04:25:08.058 --> 04:25:09.460
I DIDN'T LIKE HIS POLICIES. I

04:25:09.526 --> 04:25:11.195
DID NOT LIKE HIS EXECUTIVE

04:25:11.262 --> 04:25:12.596
ORDERS THAT I THOUGHT WERE

04:25:12.663 --> 04:25:14.965
OVERREACH OF EXECUTIVE POWER. I

04:25:15.032 --> 04:25:17.201
CERTAINLY CALLED THEM OUT. BUT

04:25:17.268 --> 04:25:20.037
OUR DEMOCRACY WAS NOT OVER. NO,

04:25:20.104 --> 04:25:22.640
NOT BY A LONG SHOT. WE DIDN'T

04:25:22.706 --> 04:25:25.009
STOP MEETING IN THESE HALLS AS

04:25:25.075 --> 04:25:26.744
THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE

04:25:26.810 --> 04:25:28.012
PEOPLE. WE DIDN'T STOP DOING

04:25:28.078 --> 04:25:30.080
THOSE THINGS. PEOPLE STILL

04:25:30.147 --> 04:25:32.182
VOTED, ELECTIONS STILL HAPPENED,

04:25:32.249 --> 04:25:34.551
AND DONALD TRUMP WAS REELECTED

04:25:34.618 --> 04:25:36.720
PRESIDENT IN THE LAST CYCLE. I

04:25:36.787 --> 04:25:37.955
KNOW THAT THAT BOTHERS YOU. I

04:25:38.022 --> 04:25:40.557
KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT, BUT HE

04:25:40.624 --> 04:25:43.360
WAS DULY ELECTED. AND OUR

04:25:43.427 --> 04:25:46.697
DEMOCRACY IS IS NO NO MORE IN

04:25:46.764 --> 04:25:48.065
PERIL THAN IT WAS BACK WHEN

04:25:48.132 --> 04:25:50.267
GEORGE W BUSH OR WHEN BARACK

04:25:50.334 --> 04:25:53.070
OBAMA WAS ELECTED, OR WHEN JOE

04:25:53.137 --> 04:25:54.972
BIDEN WAS ELECTED. SO STOP

04:25:55.039 --> 04:25:57.341
SAYING THAT BECAUSE IT

04:25:57.408 --> 04:25:59.209
CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROBLEM

04:25:59.276 --> 04:26:01.412
GETTING EVERYBODY UP FURTHER

04:26:01.478 --> 04:26:04.214
POLARIZATION, MORE VORTEX

04:26:04.281 --> 04:26:05.149
POLARIZATION THAT WE CAN'T GET

04:26:05.215 --> 04:26:07.985
OUT OF. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WE

04:26:08.052 --> 04:26:10.187
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT

04:26:10.254 --> 04:26:12.423
HERE IN THIS BUILDING TO PASS

04:26:12.489 --> 04:26:15.125
JUST LAWS. AND NOW WE HAVE A

04:26:15.192 --> 04:26:18.329
BILL BEFORE US. IT IS NOT JUST

04:26:18.395 --> 04:26:22.232
TO SUSPEND ELECTION LAWS, TO

04:26:22.299 --> 04:26:23.067
SUSPEND THE TIME THAT PEOPLE

04:26:23.133 --> 04:26:26.503
HAVE TO REVIEW CONSTITUTIONAL

04:26:26.570 --> 04:26:30.107
AMENDMENTS, TO SHORTEN THE TIME

04:26:30.174 --> 04:26:31.175
FOR WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

04:26:31.241 --> 04:26:33.010
HAVE ELECTIONS, SHORTEN THE

04:26:33.077 --> 04:26:34.178
TIME WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THE

04:26:34.244 --> 04:26:36.013
ABILITY TO REVIEW AND GIVE

04:26:36.080 --> 04:26:37.247
PUBLIC INPUT TO MOVE THROUGH

04:26:37.314 --> 04:26:39.149
THESE BILLS IN THREE DAYS, WHEN

04:26:39.216 --> 04:26:40.918
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AT

04:26:40.984 --> 04:26:42.252
LEAST 30 DAYS IN PRINT BEFORE

04:26:42.319 --> 04:26:44.221
YOU EVEN HEAR THEM AND YOU KNOW

04:26:44.288 --> 04:26:47.358
IT, IT'S NOT JUST SO DON'T

04:26:47.424 --> 04:26:49.760
PRETEND THAT IT IS. AND HERE'S

04:26:49.827 --> 04:26:53.630
ANOTHER TRUTH ALL THE FLOWERY

04:26:53.697 --> 04:26:55.666
LANGUAGE, ALL THE DEFENDING

04:26:55.733 --> 04:26:57.601
DEMOCRACY, STANDING UP,

04:26:57.668 --> 04:26:58.836
FIGHTING FOR YOUR DEMOCRACY,

04:26:58.902 --> 04:27:02.206
ALL OF THAT IS ALL SUBTERFUGE

04:27:02.272 --> 04:27:03.374
FOR THIS ONE PRINCIPLE. BECAUSE

04:27:03.440 --> 04:27:05.008
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE

04:27:05.075 --> 04:27:06.744
SAYING, THAT IN ORDER TO SAVE

04:27:06.810 --> 04:27:08.979
DEMOCRACY, WE MUST DISMANTLE IT.

04:27:09.046 --> 04:27:12.716
WE MUST UNDERMINE IT IN ORDER

04:27:12.783 --> 04:27:15.586
TO PRESERVE REPRESENTATION, YOU

04:27:15.652 --> 04:27:18.422
MUST TEMPORARILY SUSPEND IT.

04:27:18.489 --> 04:27:21.225
THAT PRINCIPLE HAS NEVER BEEN

04:27:21.291 --> 04:27:23.260
TRUE AND HAS ALWAYS LED TO

04:27:23.327 --> 04:27:25.529
DESPOTISM AND AUTHORITARIANISM.

04:27:25.596 --> 04:27:27.064
BUT YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG,

04:27:27.131 --> 04:27:29.166
MARCHING ALONG RIGHT TO IT,

04:27:29.233 --> 04:27:31.402
GIVING AWAY POWER THAT BELONGS

04:27:31.468 --> 04:27:35.973
TO THE PEOPLE. SUBVERTING THE

04:27:36.039 --> 04:27:38.242
CONSTITUTION, AND THEN SAYING

04:27:38.308 --> 04:27:40.310
YOU'RE DOING IT UNDER THE

04:27:40.377 --> 04:27:47.518
AUSPICES OF DEMOCRACY. 30S. YOU

04:27:47.584 --> 04:27:50.387
KNOW, I HAD NO PROBLEM SAYING

04:27:50.454 --> 04:27:51.889
THAT I THINK MY PRESIDENT IS

04:27:51.955 --> 04:27:55.125
WRONG. I AGREE WITH A LOT OF

04:27:55.192 --> 04:27:57.294
HIS AGENDA, BUT I THINK HE IS

04:27:57.361 --> 04:27:59.163
WRONG ON THIS POINT. WHAT I

04:27:59.229 --> 04:28:01.732
DON'T HEAR OVER THERE, ON THIS

04:28:01.799 --> 04:28:04.234
OTHER SIDE IS THAT OUR GOVERNOR

04:28:04.301 --> 04:28:08.071
IS WRONG. AND YOU WERE SILENT.

04:28:08.138 --> 04:28:10.274
DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT

04:28:10.340 --> 04:28:11.074
EXECUTIVE OVERREACH WHEN HE

04:28:11.141 --> 04:28:12.309
DIDN'T EVEN LET US GO WORSHIP

04:28:12.376 --> 04:28:14.745
IN OUR CHURCHES. AND YOU SAID

04:28:14.812 --> 04:28:16.013
NOTHING WHEN HE SHUT DOWN

04:28:16.079 --> 04:28:18.415
BUSINESSES, MANY OF THEM LATINO

04:28:18.482 --> 04:28:20.050
OWNED IMMIGRANT BUSINESSES. YOU

04:28:20.117 --> 04:28:21.518
SAID NOTHING. THANK YOU,

04:28:21.585 --> 04:28:22.352
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. SO

04:28:22.419 --> 04:28:23.587
STAND UP FOR EXECUTIVE

04:28:23.654 --> 04:28:24.988
OVERREACH WHEN IT REALLY

04:28:25.055 --> 04:28:26.190
MATTERS. AND RIGHT NOW, WE

04:28:26.256 --> 04:28:29.159
COULD DO IT WHEN IT'S A MEMBER

04:28:29.226 --> 04:28:32.796
OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER.

04:28:32.863 --> 04:28:37.201
SOME COURAGE. STATE YOUR POINT.

04:28:37.267 --> 04:28:39.803
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY

04:28:39.870 --> 04:28:40.737
MEMBER. SCHULTZ. STATE YOUR

04:28:40.804 --> 04:28:46.477
POINT OF ORDER. YEP. ALL RIGHT.

04:28:46.543 --> 04:28:48.145
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I JUST

04:28:48.212 --> 04:28:49.546
WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO

04:28:49.613 --> 04:28:51.482
FOLLOW THE RULES AND NOT IMPUGN

04:28:51.548 --> 04:28:52.216
THE INTEGRITY OF ANY MEMBER OF

04:28:52.282 --> 04:28:54.685
THE BODY. I'M PRETTY SURE I CAN

04:28:54.751 --> 04:28:55.486
BORROW ANOTHER HANDBOOK HERE BY

04:28:55.552 --> 04:28:56.987
MY SEATMATE. THANK YOU, MR.

04:28:57.054 --> 04:28:58.288
SCHULTZ. THANK YOU, MR. SCHULTZ.

04:28:58.355 --> 04:28:59.356
YOUR POINT OF ORDER IS WELL

04:28:59.423 --> 04:29:01.191
TAKEN. MEMBERS, I WILL REMIND

04:29:01.258 --> 04:29:04.628
YOU WHAT I READ EARLIER. MASON.

04:29:04.695 --> 04:29:07.064
SECTION ONE 2121. FREEDOM OF

04:29:07.130 --> 04:29:07.998
SPEECH INVOLVES OBEDIENCE TO

04:29:08.065 --> 04:29:10.100
ALL THE RULES OF DEBATE. THE

04:29:10.167 --> 04:29:12.536
LANGUAGE USED BY MEMBERS DURING

04:29:12.603 --> 04:29:13.971
DEBATE SHOULD BE TEMPERATE,

04:29:14.037 --> 04:29:17.875
DECOROUS, AND RESPECTFUL.

04:29:17.941 --> 04:29:19.309
SOMEBODY MEMBER, YOU ARE

04:29:19.376 --> 04:29:21.245
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

04:29:21.311 --> 04:29:23.413
SPEAKER. I REALLY LIKE TO DO

04:29:23.480 --> 04:29:25.249
DATA, FACTS AND DATES, SO LET'S

04:29:25.315 --> 04:29:27.050
HAVE SOME. SEVEN MONTHS AGO

04:29:27.117 --> 04:29:28.318
THERE WAS A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT

04:29:28.385 --> 04:29:29.953
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LET'S BE

04:29:30.020 --> 04:29:31.522
CLEAR. THE CHALLENGES

04:29:31.588 --> 04:29:33.223
CALIFORNIANS FACED ARE THE SAME

04:29:33.290 --> 04:29:35.292
ONES THEY ARE NOW. BUT THEN

04:29:35.359 --> 04:29:38.028
BACK THEN, SEVEN MONTHS AGO,

04:29:38.095 --> 04:29:39.329
THE AVERAGE COST OF A HOME IN

04:29:39.396 --> 04:29:41.465
THE STATE IN THIS STATE WAS

04:29:41.532 --> 04:29:44.234
825,000 WON. ONE IN EVERY FIVE

04:29:44.301 --> 04:29:45.435
CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW CAN'T

04:29:45.502 --> 04:29:47.137
AFFORD THEIR UTILITY BILLS.

04:29:47.204 --> 04:29:48.438
RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES WERE

04:29:48.505 --> 04:29:50.674
DROWNING IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT,

04:29:50.741 --> 04:29:51.575
AND SMALL BUSINESSES WERE

04:29:51.642 --> 04:29:54.144
SHUTTERING AT AN ALARMING RATE.

04:29:54.211 --> 04:29:56.046
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THIS

04:29:56.113 --> 04:29:58.715
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IN ALL

04:29:58.782 --> 04:30:01.184
OF THIS ISN'T WHO SITS IN THE

04:30:01.251 --> 04:30:03.420
WHITE HOUSE. IT'S THE

04:30:03.487 --> 04:30:05.255
PRIORITIES OF ASSEMBLY. MEMBER

04:30:05.322 --> 04:30:07.291
FOR JUST A MOMENT. ASSEMBLY

04:30:07.357 --> 04:30:09.092
MEMBER STATE, YOUR POINT OF

04:30:09.159 --> 04:30:10.327
ORDER. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.

04:30:10.394 --> 04:30:12.195
I WOULD ASK THE SPEAKERS TO

04:30:12.262 --> 04:30:14.164
ACTUALLY SPEAK TO THE BILL IN

04:30:14.231 --> 04:30:16.500
FRONT OF US. AND THANK YOU,

04:30:16.567 --> 04:30:17.968
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND YOUR POINT

04:30:18.035 --> 04:30:20.938
IS WELL TAKEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER,

04:30:21.004 --> 04:30:22.806
PLEASE SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF

04:30:22.873 --> 04:30:24.274
THIS BILL. AND WE ARE HERE

04:30:24.341 --> 04:30:27.077
TODAY DEBATING A BILL THAT DOES

04:30:27.144 --> 04:30:29.212
NOTHING TO ADDRESS HOUSING

04:30:29.279 --> 04:30:30.380
AFFORDABILITY, UTILITY RATES,

04:30:30.447 --> 04:30:32.015
EDUCATION OR SMALL BUSINESS

04:30:32.082 --> 04:30:33.183
SURVIVAL. INSTEAD, WE'RE

04:30:33.250 --> 04:30:34.918
DEBATING A BILL THAT WRITES

04:30:34.985 --> 04:30:37.254
BLANK CHECKS FOR AN ELECTION

04:30:37.321 --> 04:30:39.222
THAT SOLVES NOTHING. THAT WAS

04:30:39.289 --> 04:30:41.058
NEVER ASKED BY ANYBODY. THE

04:30:41.124 --> 04:30:42.492
LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS OFFICE AND

04:30:42.559 --> 04:30:43.393
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE, TWO

04:30:43.460 --> 04:30:45.162
OFFICES THAT RARELY AGREE ON

04:30:45.228 --> 04:30:47.297
MUCH, ARE IN LOCKSTEP ON ONE

04:30:47.364 --> 04:30:49.433
THING. OUR STATE FACES A

04:30:49.499 --> 04:30:52.836
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BETWEEN 10

04:30:52.903 --> 04:30:54.738
BILLION AND 30 BILLION UNTIL

04:30:54.805 --> 04:30:57.274
2028. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE

04:30:57.341 --> 04:30:59.009
FINAL COST OF THIS ELECTION.

04:30:59.076 --> 04:31:00.210
THE ANALYSIS SAYS IT WILL

04:31:00.277 --> 04:31:01.411
LIKELY RUN IN THE HUNDREDS OF

04:31:01.478 --> 04:31:03.413
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, WHEN AT A

04:31:03.480 --> 04:31:05.115
TIME WHEN WE'RE ALREADY IN THE

04:31:05.182 --> 04:31:06.917
RED. AND THAT'S EVEN BEFORE WE

04:31:06.984 --> 04:31:08.218
EVEN FACTOR IN THE ADDITIONAL

04:31:08.285 --> 04:31:09.386
BLANK CHECKS THAT ARE WRITTEN

04:31:09.453 --> 04:31:11.622
BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR AN

04:31:11.688 --> 04:31:13.156
INEVITABLE LITIGATION THAT WILL

04:31:13.223 --> 04:31:16.994
TRULY, TRULY FOLLOW COLLEAGUES,

04:31:17.060 --> 04:31:18.328
THIS BILL AND THE MANNER IN

04:31:18.395 --> 04:31:20.263
WHICH IT IS BEING FORCED

04:31:20.330 --> 04:31:21.131
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE, IS THE

04:31:21.198 --> 04:31:23.166
EXACT OPPOSITE OF FISCAL

04:31:23.233 --> 04:31:24.968
RESPONSIBILITY. AGAIN, AS A

04:31:25.035 --> 04:31:27.070
BUSINESS OWNER AND A REALTOR,

04:31:27.137 --> 04:31:29.539
IT USUALLY TAKES AROUND 21 DAYS

04:31:29.606 --> 04:31:31.308
TO PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE. WHEN

04:31:31.375 --> 04:31:35.112
SPENDING $500,000 ON A HOME. I

04:31:35.178 --> 04:31:37.981
CAN'T EVEN GET 21 MINUTES IN A

04:31:38.048 --> 04:31:40.117
COMMITTEE TO PERFORM DUE

04:31:40.183 --> 04:31:41.351
DILIGENCE, AND WE'RE DEBATING

04:31:41.418 --> 04:31:44.454
ON SPENDING OVER $200 MILLION.

04:31:44.521 --> 04:31:46.256
THAT'S JUST FINANCIAL INSANITY.

04:31:46.323 --> 04:31:48.058
THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD SPEND

04:31:48.125 --> 04:31:50.560
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND AFFECT

04:31:50.627 --> 04:31:52.295
40 MILLION CALIFORNIANS.

04:31:52.362 --> 04:31:54.297
WRITING BLANK CHECKS WITHOUT

04:31:54.364 --> 04:31:55.799
DUE DILIGENCE IS GROSSLY

04:31:55.866 --> 04:31:57.434
NEGLIGENT. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE

04:31:57.501 --> 04:32:00.270
MORE THAN TWO HEARINGS, LIMITED

04:32:00.337 --> 04:32:02.606
COMMENTS AND NO ANSWERS. RATHER

04:32:02.673 --> 04:32:03.140
THAN WASTING HUNDREDS OF

04:32:03.206 --> 04:32:04.241
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A

04:32:04.307 --> 04:32:05.075
SPECIAL ELECTION THAT NOBODY

04:32:05.142 --> 04:32:07.744
ASKED FOR, WE HAVE AN

04:32:07.811 --> 04:32:09.279
OPPORTUNITY TO REEVALUATE OUR

04:32:09.346 --> 04:32:11.081
PRIORITIES. THE MONEY COULD BE

04:32:11.148 --> 04:32:13.216
USED TO ADDRESS VERY REAL AND

04:32:13.283 --> 04:32:15.185
CRITICAL ISSUES. MADERA COUNTY,

04:32:15.252 --> 04:32:17.921
A RURAL COUNTY. THE HOSPITAL IS

04:32:17.988 --> 04:32:19.089
STRUGGLING TO REMAIN OPEN IN

04:32:19.156 --> 04:32:21.324
THAT EXACT COUNTY. YOU CANNOT

04:32:21.391 --> 04:32:24.394
HAVE A BABY IN IT AND I

04:32:24.461 --> 04:32:25.395
REPRESENT THEM ALONG WITH

04:32:25.462 --> 04:32:26.897
OTHERS COLLEAGUES, LET'S BE

04:32:26.963 --> 04:32:29.132
HONEST, THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

04:32:29.199 --> 04:32:30.434
SOLVING CALIFORNIA'S REAL

04:32:30.500 --> 04:32:32.102
PROBLEMS. IT'S ABOUT POLITICAL

04:32:32.169 --> 04:32:34.204
GAMESMANSHIP AT THE EXPENSE OF

04:32:34.271 --> 04:32:35.806
40 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:32:35.872 --> 04:32:37.040
ALREADY STRETCHED TO THEIR

04:32:37.107 --> 04:32:38.341
LIMITS. EVERY DOLLAR WE THROW

04:32:38.408 --> 04:32:41.011
AT A VANITY PROJECT IS A DOLLAR

04:32:41.078 --> 04:32:42.345
WE STEAL FROM FAMILIES WHO

04:32:42.412 --> 04:32:44.748
CANNOT AFFORD GROCERIES. FROM

04:32:44.815 --> 04:32:46.116
THE 6 TO 8 HOSPITALS ON THE

04:32:46.183 --> 04:32:48.251
VERGE OF CLOSING ITS DOORS FROM

04:32:48.318 --> 04:32:49.953
STUDENTS BURIED IN DEBT AND

04:32:50.020 --> 04:32:52.589
SMALL BUSINESSES JUST TRYING TO

04:32:52.656 --> 04:32:54.991
SURVIVE. IF WE ÒS THIS BILL

04:32:55.058 --> 04:32:56.326
WE'RE NOT JUST WRITING BLANK

04:32:56.393 --> 04:32:58.328
CHECKS, WE'RE WRITING OFF THE

04:32:58.395 --> 04:33:00.063
VERY PEOPLE WE ELECTED TO SERVE.

04:33:00.130 --> 04:33:02.132
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE LEADERSHIP,

04:33:02.199 --> 04:33:03.100
NOT RECKLESSNESS. THEY DESERVE

04:33:03.166 --> 04:33:05.335
SOLUTIONS, NOT DISTRACTIONS.

04:33:05.402 --> 04:33:07.204
THEY DESERVE A LEGISLATURE THAT

04:33:07.270 --> 04:33:09.106
TREATS THEIR HARD EARNED TAX

04:33:09.172 --> 04:33:10.240
DOLLARS THE SAME AS THEY TREAT

04:33:10.307 --> 04:33:13.176
THEIR OWN. I WILL NOT STAND BY

04:33:13.243 --> 04:33:15.746
AND RUBBER STAMP FINANCIAL

04:33:15.812 --> 04:33:18.115
INSANITY. I URGE YOU TO JOIN ME

04:33:18.181 --> 04:33:19.716
IN REJECTING THIS WASTEFUL,

04:33:19.783 --> 04:33:21.518
SHORTSIGHTED, AND HYPOCRITICAL

04:33:21.585 --> 04:33:24.321
BILL. WHEN ASKED MULTIPLE TIMES,

04:33:24.387 --> 04:33:26.323
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? CAN WE

04:33:26.389 --> 04:33:28.558
CAN WE ALLOCATE MONEY? I WAS

04:33:28.625 --> 04:33:30.927
ATTACKED OVER AND OVER AND OVER

04:33:30.994 --> 04:33:33.130
AGAIN. AND IF WE WANT TO USE

04:33:33.196 --> 04:33:36.066
HYPOCRISY AS AN ARGUMENT, THEN

04:33:36.133 --> 04:33:38.401
LET'S LOOK AT IT. LET'S LOOK AT

04:33:38.468 --> 04:33:39.035
THE INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING.

04:33:39.102 --> 04:33:41.438
LET'S LOOK AT ALL OF THIS.

04:33:41.505 --> 04:33:43.306
LET'S BRING UP. 1441 WHEN IT

04:33:43.373 --> 04:33:45.075
WAS IF YOU EVEN READ THE BILL,

04:33:45.142 --> 04:33:48.078
IF YOU EVEN READ THAT PARTIZAN

04:33:48.145 --> 04:33:50.247
GERRYMANDERING BILL, YOU WOULD

04:33:50.313 --> 04:33:51.748
REALIZE THAT IT'S BASED OFF OF

04:33:51.815 --> 04:33:53.383
THE REGISTRATION IN THAT COUNTY

04:33:53.450 --> 04:33:55.185
GETS THE MAJORITY. AND IT ALSO

04:33:55.252 --> 04:33:56.987
HAS WRITTEN IN THAT BILL THAT

04:33:57.053 --> 04:33:58.288
THE MINORITY PARTY DOESN'T EVEN

04:33:58.355 --> 04:34:00.290
HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT. THAT IS

04:34:00.357 --> 04:34:01.992
STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE

04:34:02.058 --> 04:34:03.026
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

04:34:03.093 --> 04:34:05.262
COMMISSION WE HAVE HERE. AND IT

04:34:05.328 --> 04:34:07.063
IS A BLATANT LIE. AND YOU ARE

04:34:07.130 --> 04:34:08.265
TRYING TO GASLIGHT PEOPLE THAT

04:34:08.331 --> 04:34:09.399
WE ARE HYPOCRITICAL. LET ME DO

04:34:09.466 --> 04:34:11.101
YOU ONE BETTER, BECAUSE I LOOK

04:34:11.168 --> 04:34:14.037
AT THIS SO MUCH. 30S BILL, THAT

04:34:14.104 --> 04:34:17.274
WAS AB 2030 IN 2022 THAT

04:34:17.340 --> 04:34:19.543
CREATED THE EXACT SAME THING.

04:34:19.609 --> 04:34:20.977
THAT WAS A PARTIZAN CITIZENS

04:34:21.044 --> 04:34:23.513
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. I ASK

04:34:23.580 --> 04:34:24.447
THAT YOU LOOK AT A NONPARTISAN

04:34:24.514 --> 04:34:26.016
INDEPENDENT ONE AND YOU PROTECT

04:34:26.082 --> 04:34:27.751
THE SANCTITY OF IT, AND YOU

04:34:27.818 --> 04:34:28.518
ALSO PRIORITIZE THE

04:34:28.585 --> 04:34:30.353
CALIFORNIANS WALLETS BECAUSE

04:34:30.420 --> 04:34:32.222
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE BS. I

04:34:32.289 --> 04:34:35.292
URGE A NO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

04:34:35.358 --> 04:34:39.362
MEMBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCKENNA,

04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:41.198
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES, MR.

04:34:41.264 --> 04:34:42.966
CHAIR AND MEMBERS, I URGE AN

04:34:43.033 --> 04:34:46.236
EYE ON SB 280 AS WE LOOK AT HOW

04:34:46.303 --> 04:34:48.438
MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST TO TO

04:34:48.505 --> 04:34:49.606
HOLD THIS ELECTION. MY

04:34:49.673 --> 04:34:53.210
COLLEAGUE QUOTED $200 MILLION

04:34:53.276 --> 04:34:54.311
WHERE I CAN FIND THAT $200

04:34:54.377 --> 04:34:58.381
MILLION DONALD TRUMP. HE'S

04:34:58.448 --> 04:34:59.716
FROZE NEARLY $1 BILLION IN

04:34:59.783 --> 04:35:01.551
EDUCATION FUNDS MEANT FOR

04:35:01.618 --> 04:35:03.320
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. THIS MONEY

04:35:03.386 --> 04:35:05.021
SUPPORTS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS,

04:35:05.088 --> 04:35:07.090
TEACHERS TRAINING AND ENGLISH

04:35:07.157 --> 04:35:09.259
LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT TENS OF

04:35:09.326 --> 04:35:10.126
THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA KIDS

04:35:10.193 --> 04:35:12.395
RELY ON. HE STRIPPING THESE

04:35:12.462 --> 04:35:14.030
FUNDS, PUNISHING OUR MOST

04:35:14.097 --> 04:35:16.566
VULNERABLE. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP

04:35:16.633 --> 04:35:18.134
IS NOT JUST PLAYING POLITICS.

04:35:18.201 --> 04:35:20.303
HE'S DELIBERATELY PUNISHING

04:35:20.370 --> 04:35:22.172
CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES, STUDENTS

04:35:22.239 --> 04:35:24.307
AND WORKERS BY WITHHOLDING

04:35:24.374 --> 04:35:26.610
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'VE

04:35:26.676 --> 04:35:28.144
ALREADY EARNED. WE CANNOT. WE

04:35:28.211 --> 04:35:30.213
CANNOT ALLOW ONE MAN'S VENDETTA

04:35:30.280 --> 04:35:33.450
TO ROB OUR STATE OF ITS FUTURE.

04:35:33.516 --> 04:35:36.253
HE'S ALSO HOLDING RESEARCH IN

04:35:36.319 --> 04:35:38.154
HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDS. TRUMP

04:35:38.221 --> 04:35:41.324
HAS PULLED $584 MILLION IN

04:35:41.391 --> 04:35:43.159
FEDERAL RESEARCH GRANTS FROM

04:35:43.226 --> 04:35:45.228
UCLA ALONE, THREATENING

04:35:45.295 --> 04:35:47.063
GROUNDBREAKING CANCER RESEARCH.

04:35:47.130 --> 04:35:49.232
HE'S PULLING MONEY. HE'S

04:35:49.299 --> 04:35:52.002
HOLDING MONEY. I HAVEN'T HEARD

04:35:52.068 --> 04:35:55.005
ANYONE STAND UP AND SAY WHY HE

04:35:55.071 --> 04:35:57.173
IS PULLING MONEY FROM OUR STATE

04:35:57.240 --> 04:35:59.910
ON THIS VENDETTA. AND SO I

04:35:59.976 --> 04:36:02.112
THINK THAT WE CAN FIND THE

04:36:02.178 --> 04:36:04.247
MONEY TO SAVE DEMOCRACY. AND

04:36:04.314 --> 04:36:06.917
WITH THAT, I ASK FOR AN AYE

04:36:06.983 --> 04:36:08.485
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:10.420
MEMBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. DAVIS,

04:36:10.487 --> 04:36:12.989
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

04:36:13.056 --> 04:36:16.192
MR. SPEAKER. YES, THERE WERE

04:36:16.259 --> 04:36:18.061
FIVE QUESTIONS TO MY POLL, SO I

04:36:18.128 --> 04:36:19.262
THOUGHT I'D FINISH THEM UP

04:36:19.329 --> 04:36:21.398
AGAIN. LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE,

04:36:21.464 --> 04:36:23.099
BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING IS

04:36:23.166 --> 04:36:24.367
THERE'S NO LIMIT TO THE COST

04:36:24.434 --> 04:36:27.637
FOR THIS ELECTION. SO WE HAD A

04:36:27.704 --> 04:36:29.306
QUESTION. IF THE STATE WERE TO

04:36:29.372 --> 04:36:31.408
HOLD A SPECIAL ELECTION TO

04:36:31.474 --> 04:36:32.275
CHANGE THE REDISTRICTING

04:36:32.342 --> 04:36:33.877
PROCESS, IT COULD COST

04:36:33.944 --> 04:36:36.112
TAXPAYERS MORE THAN $200

04:36:36.179 --> 04:36:38.248
MILLION. KNOWING THIS, WOULD

04:36:38.315 --> 04:36:40.116
YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE HOLDING A

04:36:40.183 --> 04:36:43.219
SPECIAL ELECTION ON THIS ISSUE?

04:36:43.286 --> 04:36:46.456
DEMOCRATS SUPPORTED IT BY 64%.

04:36:46.523 --> 04:36:50.060
REPUBLICANS OPPOSED IT BY 90%.

04:36:50.126 --> 04:36:52.495
AND ONCE AGAIN, INDEPENDENTS

04:36:52.562 --> 04:36:55.298
OPPOSED IT BY 69%. ALSO, SOME

04:36:55.365 --> 04:36:56.933
PEOPLE SAY GIVING REDISTRICTING

04:36:57.000 --> 04:36:58.335
POWER BACK TO POLITICIANS COULD

04:36:58.401 --> 04:37:00.503
LEAD TO GERRYMANDERING.

04:37:00.570 --> 04:37:02.072
DISTRICTS DRAWN TO FAVOR

04:37:02.138 --> 04:37:05.208
INCUMBENTS OR ONE PARTY. OTHERS

04:37:05.275 --> 04:37:06.142
SAY POLITICIANS ARE ACCOUNTABLE

04:37:06.209 --> 04:37:09.112
TO VOTERS AND SHOULD HAVE THIS

04:37:09.179 --> 04:37:10.347
RESPONSIBILITY. WHICH VIEW

04:37:10.413 --> 04:37:12.115
COMES CLOSEST TO YOURS AND YOUR

04:37:12.182 --> 04:37:15.018
CONCERNS? 56% OF DEMOCRATS SAID

04:37:15.085 --> 04:37:18.088
THEY HAD CONCERNS. REPUBLICANS,

04:37:18.154 --> 04:37:20.657
98% SAID THEY HAD CONCERNS WITH

04:37:20.724 --> 04:37:23.626
POLITICIANS MAKING THE THE MAPS,

04:37:23.693 --> 04:37:27.063
AND 90% OF INDEPENDENTS HAD

04:37:27.130 --> 04:37:28.465
STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT PUTTING

04:37:28.531 --> 04:37:30.266
IN THE HANDS OF POLITICIANS. SO

04:37:30.333 --> 04:37:33.603
ONCE AGAIN, IT'S NOT MY VOICE,

04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:35.238
IT'S THE PEOPLE'S VOICE, AND

04:37:35.305 --> 04:37:39.643
THEY DESERVE TO BE HEARD. I

04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:41.277
RECOMMEND AN OPPOSITION TO SB

04:37:41.344 --> 04:37:44.714
280. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

04:37:44.781 --> 04:37:45.215
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. DAVIS,

04:37:45.281 --> 04:37:47.183
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN, YOU ARE

04:37:47.250 --> 04:37:48.985
RECOGNIZED. MR. SPEAKER, IS

THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?

04:37:53.857 --> 04:37:55.458
ARE YOU ASKING THE CHAIR? MR.

04:37:55.525 --> 04:37:57.160
BERMAN I'M ASKING THE SPEAKER

04:37:57.227 --> 04:37:59.162
IF WE HAVE. I AM SEVERELY

04:37:59.229 --> 04:37:59.996
WORRIED. SOME COLLEAGUES FROM

04:38:00.063 --> 04:38:02.198
ACROSS THE AISLE ARE SUFFERING

04:38:02.265 --> 04:38:04.467
FROM SEVERE GAVIN DERANGEMENT

04:38:04.534 --> 04:38:06.169
SYNDROME, AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT

04:38:06.236 --> 04:38:09.172
THEIR HEALTH. BUT I'LL TELL YOU,

04:38:09.239 --> 04:38:12.175
I'M SO TIRED. I'M SO TIRED OF

04:38:12.242 --> 04:38:15.045
HEARING THE PHÐ OUTRAGE AND THE

04:38:15.111 --> 04:38:18.415
LECTURING AND THE HYPOCRISY

04:38:18.481 --> 04:38:22.152
FROM COLLEAGUES WHO ARE SILENT

04:38:22.218 --> 04:38:26.289
OR WORSE YET, SUPPORT EFFORTS

04:38:26.356 --> 04:38:28.425
TO RIP FOOD ASSISTANCE AWAY

04:38:28.491 --> 04:38:30.126
FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

04:38:30.193 --> 04:38:31.795
CALIFORNIANS WHO SUPPORTED

04:38:31.861 --> 04:38:34.431
EFFORTS TO RIP HEALTH CARE AWAY

04:38:34.497 --> 04:38:36.966
FROM MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS,

04:38:37.033 --> 04:38:40.103
ESPECIALLY IN THEIR DISTRICTS.

04:38:40.170 --> 04:38:42.238
I'M SO TIRED OF REPUBLICANS.

04:38:42.305 --> 04:38:43.306
EXCUSE ME? COLLEAGUES FROM

04:38:43.373 --> 04:38:45.442
ACROSS THE AISLE WHO COMPLAIN

04:38:45.508 --> 04:38:47.210
ABOUT THE COST OF DEMOCRACY,

04:38:47.277 --> 04:38:49.312
BUT WHO ARE SILENT WHEN THE

04:38:49.379 --> 04:38:51.047
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

04:38:51.114 --> 04:38:52.315
THE DULY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF

04:38:52.382 --> 04:38:54.451
THE UNITED STATES. NEVER A

04:38:54.517 --> 04:38:57.287
DEBATE ON THAT FOR ME. NO! STOP

04:38:57.353 --> 04:39:01.391
THE STEAL OVER HERE. WANTS TO

04:39:01.458 --> 04:39:03.893
EXTORT CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS

04:39:03.960 --> 04:39:08.531
FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT

04:39:08.598 --> 04:39:10.500
NOW. NOW, WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO

04:39:10.567 --> 04:39:12.535
DEFEND DEMOCRACY, IT'S TOO HIGH

04:39:12.602 --> 04:39:18.007
OF A COST TO BEAR. EIGHT AND A

04:39:18.074 --> 04:39:21.578
HALF YEARS IN, AND THE PHÐ

04:39:21.644 --> 04:39:23.646
OUTRAGE HAS GOTTEN A LITTLE

04:39:23.713 --> 04:39:27.083
NAUSEATING. I ENCOURAGE MY

04:39:27.150 --> 04:39:28.685
COLLEAGUES TO VOTE AYE ON SB

04:39:28.751 --> 04:39:31.988
280. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:39:32.055 --> 04:39:33.089
BERMAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

04:39:33.156 --> 04:39:34.991
CHADWICK, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

04:39:35.058 --> 04:39:38.027
MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY IN

04:39:38.094 --> 04:39:40.263
STRONG OPPOSITION. I RISE TODAY

04:39:40.330 --> 04:39:41.364
FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA, FOR THE

04:39:41.431 --> 04:39:42.732
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ONCE

04:39:42.799 --> 04:39:44.000
AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN BEEN

04:39:44.067 --> 04:39:46.069
FORGOTTEN AND SIDELINED BY A

04:39:46.136 --> 04:39:48.671
PROCESS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

04:39:48.738 --> 04:39:49.239
TRANSPARENT, BUT INSTEAD WAS

04:39:49.305 --> 04:39:50.406
CONDUCTED IN SECRET BEHIND

04:39:50.473 --> 04:39:52.075
CLOSED DOORS. I'VE STOOD SIDE

04:39:52.142 --> 04:39:54.377
BY SIDE BY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH

04:39:54.444 --> 04:39:56.379
SIDES OF THE AISLE TO FIGHT FOR

04:39:56.446 --> 04:39:58.081
FEDERAL FUNDING. I TRULY TRY TO

04:39:58.148 --> 04:39:59.916
MAKE DECISIONS FOR PEOPLE, FOR

04:39:59.983 --> 04:40:02.118
THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN MY VERY

04:40:02.185 --> 04:40:04.521
UNIQUE DISTRICT. I WENT TO D.C.

04:40:04.587 --> 04:40:05.989
TO SPEAK AGAIN TO BOTH SIDES OF

04:40:06.055 --> 04:40:08.091
THE AISLE FOR FUNDING FOR

04:40:08.158 --> 04:40:09.626
SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS, FOR HEAD

04:40:09.692 --> 04:40:11.094
START, FOR TRIBES. SO I WAS NOT

04:40:11.161 --> 04:40:13.296
SILENT THEN, AND I CAN'T BE

04:40:13.363 --> 04:40:14.864
SILENT NOW. THESE REDISTRICTING

04:40:14.931 --> 04:40:17.133
EFFORTS DIVIDE MY DISTRICT INTO

04:40:17.200 --> 04:40:18.234
PIECES, SPLITTING APART

04:40:18.301 --> 04:40:19.936
COMMUNITIES THAT SHARE HISTORY,

04:40:20.003 --> 04:40:21.571
GEOGRAPHY, AND REAL HUMAN

04:40:21.638 --> 04:40:23.773
CONNECTION. HOW DOES MODOC

04:40:23.840 --> 04:40:25.175
COUNTY BELONG IN A DISTRICT

04:40:25.241 --> 04:40:27.110
WITH MARIN AND THE GOLDEN GATE

04:40:27.177 --> 04:40:28.912
BRIDGE? THESE COUNTIES ARE 400

04:40:28.978 --> 04:40:31.581
MILES APART AND SEPARATED BY

04:40:31.648 --> 04:40:32.615
TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES. THE

04:40:32.682 --> 04:40:34.484
PRIORITY PRIORITIES OF ALTURAS

04:40:34.551 --> 04:40:37.720
AND SAUSALITO COULD NOT BE MORE

04:40:37.787 --> 04:40:39.289
DIFFERENT. MY RURAL COUNTY THAT

04:40:39.355 --> 04:40:41.124
BORDERS OREGON AND NEVADA WITH

04:40:41.191 --> 04:40:43.293
8000 RESIDENTS NOW, WILL HAVE

04:40:43.359 --> 04:40:44.394
THE SAME REPRESENTATIVE AS OUR

04:40:44.460 --> 04:40:47.263
GOVERNOR IN MARIN COUNTY, MODOC

04:40:47.330 --> 04:40:48.198
COUNTY, ONE OF THE POOREST AND

04:40:48.264 --> 04:40:50.233
MOST REMOTE IN THE STATE,

04:40:50.300 --> 04:40:51.367
GROUPED WITH MARIN COUNTY, ONE

04:40:51.434 --> 04:40:53.069
OF THE WEALTHIEST AND URBAN.

04:40:53.136 --> 04:40:54.470
THAT IS NOT A COMMUNITY OF

04:40:54.537 --> 04:40:55.972
INTEREST. THAT IS POLITICAL.

04:40:56.039 --> 04:40:58.808
FRANKENSTEIN. THE PEOPLE, NOT

04:40:58.875 --> 04:41:00.243
THE POLITICIANS, SHOULD CHOOSE

04:41:00.310 --> 04:41:02.312
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. MY

04:41:02.378 --> 04:41:03.913
DISTRICT HATES GOVERNMENT. I

04:41:03.980 --> 04:41:06.082
GREW UP IN THE ORIGINAL STATE

04:41:06.149 --> 04:41:07.283
OF JEFFERSON. THEY DON'T TRUST

04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:09.419
OUR STATE. THIS PLAN IS A

04:41:09.485 --> 04:41:11.154
VIOLATION OF WHAT LITTLE PUBLIC

04:41:11.221 --> 04:41:13.323
TRUST WE HAVE LEFT WITH

04:41:13.389 --> 04:41:14.490
CALIFORNIANS. IT'S EXPENSIVE,

04:41:14.557 --> 04:41:16.659
IT'S RUSHED, AND IT'S DONE

04:41:16.726 --> 04:41:17.994
WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE VERY

04:41:18.061 --> 04:41:19.162
PEOPLE THAT WE CLAIM TO BE

04:41:19.229 --> 04:41:21.264
PROTECTING. AND IF IT CAN

04:41:21.331 --> 04:41:22.865
HAPPEN HERE, IT CAN HAPPEN

04:41:22.932 --> 04:41:24.467
ANYWHERE. AND I DON'T AGREE

04:41:24.534 --> 04:41:26.169
THAT IT SHOULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE.

04:41:26.236 --> 04:41:27.337
THE GAME'S THE REVENGE, THE

04:41:27.403 --> 04:41:29.072
HATE, THE POLITICIAN ANSWERS TO

04:41:29.138 --> 04:41:30.173
VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS. THE

04:41:30.240 --> 04:41:32.175
ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIS BODY THIS

04:41:32.242 --> 04:41:34.344
WEEK. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE DON'T

04:41:34.410 --> 04:41:36.112
TRUST US. WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF

04:41:36.179 --> 04:41:38.014
QUOTES FROM MARTIN LUTHER KING

04:41:38.081 --> 04:41:39.249
JR TODAY, AND ONE OF MY

04:41:39.315 --> 04:41:40.984
FAVORITES THAT HE'S ALSO MOST

04:41:41.050 --> 04:41:42.151
PROBABLY HIS MOST FAMOUS QUOTE

04:41:42.218 --> 04:41:44.387
THAT I TRY TO LIVE BY EVERY DAY

04:41:44.454 --> 04:41:46.122
IS DARKNESS CANNOT DRIVE OUT

04:41:46.189 --> 04:41:48.191
DARKNESS. ONLY LIGHT CAN DO

04:41:48.258 --> 04:41:49.192
THAT. AND HATE CANNOT DRIVE OUT

04:41:49.259 --> 04:41:52.528
HATE. ONLY LOVE CAN DO THAT. MY

04:41:52.595 --> 04:41:53.296
DISTRICT HAS TWO CONGRESSMEN

04:41:53.363 --> 04:41:54.931
THAT ARE BOLD, RELENTLESS

04:41:54.998 --> 04:41:56.499
FIGHTERS WHO STAND TALL FOR

04:41:56.566 --> 04:41:57.900
RURAL CALIFORNIA. THEY DON'T

04:41:57.967 --> 04:41:59.936
BACK DOWN FROM A FIGHT, WHETHER

04:42:00.003 --> 04:42:01.237
IT'S DEFENDING OUR WATER, OUR

04:42:01.304 --> 04:42:02.939
FARMS, OUR NATURAL RESOURCES,

04:42:03.006 --> 04:42:05.475
DISASTER RELIEF, OR SIMPLY OUR

04:42:05.541 --> 04:42:07.443
WAY OF LIFE. NOW THEY ARE BEING

04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:09.178
TARGETED WITH THIS NEW MAP

04:42:09.245 --> 04:42:10.713
DESIGNED TO SILENCE OUR VOICE

04:42:10.780 --> 04:42:13.016
AGAIN. STRIP WHAT LITTLE POWER

04:42:13.082 --> 04:42:14.250
THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE

04:42:14.317 --> 04:42:15.985
AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE

04:42:16.052 --> 04:42:17.587
THEM. WE NEED LEADERS WHO KNOW

04:42:17.654 --> 04:42:19.289
US, WHO STAND WITH US AND FIGHT

04:42:19.355 --> 04:42:21.090
LIKE HELL FOR US. THEY ARE

04:42:21.157 --> 04:42:23.359
LOVED IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE

04:42:23.426 --> 04:42:25.561
THEY UNDERSTAND MY VERY UNIQUE

04:42:25.628 --> 04:42:27.230
DISTRICT. YOU CANNOT SERVE

04:42:27.297 --> 04:42:28.665
COMMUNITIES THAT YOU DO NOT

04:42:28.731 --> 04:42:30.733
UNDERSTAND, AND YOU CANNOT

04:42:30.800 --> 04:42:32.101
FAIRLY REPRESENT PEOPLE WHOSE

04:42:32.168 --> 04:42:33.303
VOICES YOU DELIBERATELY SILENCE.

04:42:33.369 --> 04:42:35.238
MY DISTRICT IS ARGUABLY THE

04:42:35.305 --> 04:42:37.340
MOST CONSERVATIVE IN THE STATE,

04:42:37.407 --> 04:42:39.042
AND I TRULY HATE THE PARTY

04:42:39.108 --> 04:42:41.277
LINES, THE DIVIDE. I REPRESENT

04:42:41.344 --> 04:42:43.646
EVERYONE THAT LIVES IN MY

04:42:43.713 --> 04:42:44.280
DISTRICT, NO MATTER WHAT PARTY,

04:42:44.347 --> 04:42:46.182
AND I TRY TO TAKE THAT INTO

04:42:46.249 --> 04:42:46.983
CONSIDERATION IN MY WORK

04:42:47.050 --> 04:42:49.552
BECAUSE THAT IS GOOD GOVERNANCE.

04:42:49.619 --> 04:42:51.321
THE PARTY DIVIDE IN THESE NEW

04:42:51.387 --> 04:42:53.156
MAPS ARE NOT MY ONLY CONCERN.

04:42:53.222 --> 04:42:55.291
MY CONCERN IS THAT MY DISTRICT

04:42:55.358 --> 04:42:57.060
IS DICED INTO PIECES, CREATING

04:42:57.126 --> 04:42:59.195
AN URBAN VERSUS RURAL DIVIDE

04:42:59.262 --> 04:43:01.297
THAT ALREADY HAPPENS EVERY DAY

04:43:01.364 --> 04:43:03.399
IN THIS BUILDING. THIS IS NOT

04:43:03.466 --> 04:43:05.168
GOOD GOVERNANCE. THIS IS ABOUT

04:43:05.234 --> 04:43:06.369
CONTROL. AND IT'S RURAL

04:43:06.436 --> 04:43:07.603
CALIFORNIANS WHO WILL PAY THE

04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:09.238
PRICE. THIS ISN'T JUST BAD

04:43:09.305 --> 04:43:12.442
POLICY, IT'S BAD FAITH. AND

04:43:12.508 --> 04:43:13.176
CALIFORNIANS, MY CONSTITUENTS

04:43:13.242 --> 04:43:15.044
DESERVE BETTER THAN TO BE USED

04:43:15.111 --> 04:43:16.312
AS PAWNS IN A POLITICAL GAME

04:43:16.379 --> 04:43:18.281
THAT WE WEREN'T EVEN INVITED TO

04:43:18.348 --> 04:43:19.916
PLAY IN. I BELIEVE THE VOTERS

04:43:19.982 --> 04:43:21.117
WILL SEE THROUGH THIS IN

04:43:21.184 --> 04:43:22.418
NOVEMBER, AND THE RESULTS WILL

04:43:22.485 --> 04:43:25.021
BE THAT WE ALL LOSE. THE ONLY

04:43:25.088 --> 04:43:26.289
THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

04:43:26.356 --> 04:43:29.058
IS MORE CALIFORNIANS THAT THINK

04:43:29.125 --> 04:43:31.094
THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT IS ONCE

04:43:31.160 --> 04:43:32.428
AGAIN TRYING TO TRICK THEM,

04:43:32.495 --> 04:43:33.963
ONCE AGAIN WASTING MONEY ON

04:43:34.030 --> 04:43:35.131
POLITICAL MESSAGING AND ONCE

04:43:35.198 --> 04:43:37.400
AGAIN LETTING THEM DOWN. THE

04:43:37.467 --> 04:43:39.102
PEOPLE, NOT THE POLITICIANS,

04:43:39.168 --> 04:43:40.069
SHOULD CHOOSE THEIR

04:43:40.136 --> 04:43:42.071
REPRESENTATIVES. AND AT THE END

04:43:42.138 --> 04:43:43.005
OF THE DAY, CALIFORNIANS

04:43:43.072 --> 04:43:46.242
DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. THANK

04:43:46.309 --> 04:43:49.545
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARDWICK,

04:43:49.612 --> 04:43:50.613
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SANCHEZ, YOU

04:43:50.680 --> 04:43:53.182
ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES, AS

04:43:53.249 --> 04:43:54.817
WE LISTEN TO THE DEBATES TODAY

04:43:54.884 --> 04:43:56.252
ON THE FLOOR, DO YOU UNDERSTAND

04:43:56.319 --> 04:43:58.321
NOW WHY PEOPLE FEEL THE SYSTEM

04:43:58.388 --> 04:44:00.256
IS RIGGED AGAINST THEM? THESE

04:44:00.323 --> 04:44:01.057
DISCUSSIONS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT

04:44:01.124 --> 04:44:03.326
MAPS. THEY ARE ABOUT OUR VALUES.

04:44:03.393 --> 04:44:04.927
IT'S ABOUT WHETHER THIS

04:44:04.994 --> 04:44:06.796
LEGISLATURE IS LISTENING TO THE

04:44:06.863 --> 04:44:08.264
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA OR ONLY TO

04:44:08.331 --> 04:44:12.135
ITSELF. ON APRIL 23RD, 2025,

04:44:12.201 --> 04:44:13.336
SPEAKER ROBERT RIVAS SAID

04:44:13.403 --> 04:44:14.103
SOMETHING THAT HIT HOME FOR SO

04:44:14.170 --> 04:44:16.406
MANY OF US. CALIFORNIA'S COST

04:44:16.472 --> 04:44:19.342
OF LIVING IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST

04:44:19.409 --> 04:44:21.110
THREAT TO OUR FUTURE MIDDLE

04:44:21.177 --> 04:44:23.079
CLASS FAMILIES EARNING 125,000

04:44:23.146 --> 04:44:25.848
A YEAR ARE STRUGGLING TO AFFORD

04:44:25.915 --> 04:44:28.217
RENT, CHILD CARE, GROCERIES AND

04:44:28.284 --> 04:44:31.220
THAT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. HE WAS

04:44:31.287 --> 04:44:33.222
RIGHT. I SEE IT IN MY COMMUNITY

04:44:33.289 --> 04:44:34.323
EVERY SINGLE DAY. HECK, I'VE

04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:36.959
LIVED IT. FAMILIES WORKING 2 TO

04:44:37.026 --> 04:44:38.394
3 JOBS, PARENTS LEAVING THE

04:44:38.461 --> 04:44:40.296
HOUSE BEFORE THE SUN COMES UP

04:44:40.363 --> 04:44:41.564
AND COMING HOME LATE AT NIGHT,

04:44:41.631 --> 04:44:43.032
STILL WONDERING IF THEY'RE ABLE

04:44:43.099 --> 04:44:45.168
TO MAKE ENOUGH FOR RENT TO KEEP

04:44:45.234 --> 04:44:47.036
THE LIGHTS ON OR TO PUT FOOD ON

04:44:47.103 --> 04:44:48.971
THE TABLE. AND YET, HERE WE ARE

04:44:49.038 --> 04:44:52.475
ASKING FOR $250 MILLION FROM

04:44:52.542 --> 04:44:53.376
THOSE SAME FAMILIES AND

04:44:53.443 --> 04:44:56.045
SPENDING IT ON REDISTRICTING,

04:44:56.112 --> 04:44:59.315
ON CARVING UP MAPS TO PROTECT

04:44:59.382 --> 04:45:02.084
POLITICIANS. LET'S BE REAL.

04:45:02.151 --> 04:45:04.220
THIS $250 MILLION IS NOT GOING

04:45:04.287 --> 04:45:06.322
TO PUT A BAG OF GROCERIES ON

04:45:06.389 --> 04:45:08.191
THE TABLE. IT DOESN'T HELP A

04:45:08.257 --> 04:45:09.225
MOM PAY FOR CHILDCARE. IT

04:45:09.292 --> 04:45:11.227
DOESN'T KEEP A ROOF OVER A

04:45:11.294 --> 04:45:13.062
FAMILY'S HEAD. WHAT IT DOES DO

04:45:13.129 --> 04:45:15.131
IS MAKE LIFE HARDER FOR THE

04:45:15.198 --> 04:45:16.365
VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY

04:45:16.432 --> 04:45:19.168
STRUGGLING THE MOST. THAT MONEY

04:45:19.235 --> 04:45:21.170
COULD BE USED TO KEEP TEACHERS

04:45:21.237 --> 04:45:22.205
IN CLASSROOMS TO REDUCE CHILD

04:45:22.271 --> 04:45:24.307
CARE. WAIT LISTS THAT WORKING

04:45:24.373 --> 04:45:25.975
PARENTS HAVE BEEN STUCK ON FOR

04:45:26.042 --> 04:45:28.110
YEARS TO FUND WILDFIRE

04:45:28.177 --> 04:45:29.312
PREVENTION, OR TO EXPAND MENTAL

04:45:29.378 --> 04:45:30.980
HEALTH SERVICES THAT OUR

04:45:31.047 --> 04:45:34.183
COMMUNITY SO DESPERATELY NEED.

04:45:34.250 --> 04:45:35.084
INSTEAD, SACRAMENTO WANTS TO

04:45:35.151 --> 04:45:38.120
WASTE IT ON POLITICS, AND

04:45:38.187 --> 04:45:39.922
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. TOO OFTEN,

04:45:39.989 --> 04:45:42.091
THIS BUILDING PUTS THE NEEDS OF

04:45:42.158 --> 04:45:43.326
POLITICIANS BEFORE THE NEEDS OF

04:45:43.392 --> 04:45:45.061
THE PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY SO

04:45:45.127 --> 04:45:46.262
MANY CALIFORNIANS, ESPECIALLY

04:45:46.329 --> 04:45:47.897
IN WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES

04:45:47.964 --> 04:45:50.132
AND IN LATINO COMMUNITIES LIKE

04:45:50.199 --> 04:45:52.869
MINE, FEEL FORGOTTEN. WE CAME

04:45:52.935 --> 04:45:55.104
HERE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE, TO

04:45:55.171 --> 04:45:57.406
SERVE OUR BROTHERS, TO SERVE

04:45:57.473 --> 04:45:59.442
OUR SISTERS AND OUR

04:45:59.509 --> 04:46:01.177
NEIGHBORHOODS, NOT TO SERVE

04:46:01.244 --> 04:46:03.045
OURSELVES. AND THE PEOPLE ARE

04:46:03.112 --> 04:46:05.248
TELLING US LOUD AND CLEAR THEY

04:46:05.314 --> 04:46:07.283
CANNOT AFFORD MORE BROKEN

04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:10.686
PROMISES. SO I URGE YOU, STAND

04:46:10.753 --> 04:46:11.954
WITH OUR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES.

04:46:12.021 --> 04:46:14.156
STAND WITH THE WORKERS WHO ARE

04:46:14.223 --> 04:46:14.991
BREAKING THEIR BACKS TO GIVE

04:46:15.057 --> 04:46:17.527
THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR KIDS A

04:46:17.593 --> 04:46:19.896
BETTER FUTURE. REJECT THIS $250

04:46:19.962 --> 04:46:22.498
MILLION POWER GRAB REJECT

04:46:22.565 --> 04:46:25.635
RIGGING THE SYSTEM AGAINST THE

04:46:25.701 --> 04:46:27.270
PEOPLE. PROTECT FAMILIES NOT

04:46:27.336 --> 04:46:29.038
POLITICIANS. I URGE A NO ON SB

04:46:29.105 --> 04:46:31.440
280. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

04:46:31.507 --> 04:46:33.075
SANCHEZ. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

04:46:33.142 --> 04:46:34.110
STEFANI. YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

04:46:34.176 --> 04:46:38.915
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

04:46:38.981 --> 04:46:41.183
AFTER A CONTENTIOUS WEEK BEING

04:46:41.250 --> 04:46:43.085
IN ELECTIONS COMMITTEE ON

04:46:43.152 --> 04:46:45.288
TUESDAY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

04:46:45.354 --> 04:46:48.591
I SAID IN THAT COMMITTEE WAS

04:46:48.658 --> 04:46:51.160
JUST STATING THE OBVIOUS. THEY

04:46:51.227 --> 04:46:52.094
FEEL ONE WAY ABOUT WHAT IS

04:46:52.161 --> 04:46:54.130
HAPPENING IN TEXAS OR WHAT HAS

04:46:54.196 --> 04:46:56.165
HAPPENED IN TEXAS. AND WE FEEL

04:46:56.232 --> 04:46:58.634
ANOTHER. AND I'M DESPERATELY

04:46:58.701 --> 04:47:00.870
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE OTHER

04:47:00.937 --> 04:47:03.673
SIDE. AND IT CAME TO ME THAT

04:47:03.739 --> 04:47:06.609
THIS IS REALLY JUST ABOUT POWER.

04:47:06.676 --> 04:47:11.280
THEY ARE OKAY WITH HIS POWER.

04:47:11.347 --> 04:47:15.284
WE ARE NOT. WHAT IS HAPPENING

04:47:15.351 --> 04:47:17.119
IN TEXAS, MAYBE HAPPENING IN

04:47:17.186 --> 04:47:20.289
OHIO, MISSOURI, FLORIDA AND

04:47:20.356 --> 04:47:22.325
OTHERS DOESN'T SCARE THE OTHER

04:47:22.391 --> 04:47:24.794
SIDE. YOU MIGHT SAY

04:47:24.860 --> 04:47:27.530
GERRYMANDERING IS WRONG, BUT IT

04:47:27.597 --> 04:47:31.067
DOESN'T SCARE YOU. IT SCARES US,

04:47:31.133 --> 04:47:35.805
SCARES ME A LOT. YOU ARE OKAY

04:47:35.871 --> 04:47:39.008
WITH HIS LEADERSHIP. WE ARE NOT.

04:47:39.075 --> 04:47:43.346
YOU ARE OKAY WITH HIS INSANE

04:47:43.412 --> 04:47:45.648
ALL CAPS TWEETS THAT EMBARRASS

04:47:45.715 --> 04:47:49.085
THIS COUNTRY. I AM NOT. YOU ARE

04:47:49.151 --> 04:47:51.220
OKAY WITH THE ROLLING OUT OF

04:47:51.287 --> 04:47:53.155
THE RED CARPET FOR A MURDEROUS

04:47:53.222 --> 04:47:56.025
DICTATOR ON AMERICAN SOIL. I AM

04:47:56.092 --> 04:48:00.196
NOT. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS

04:48:00.262 --> 04:48:04.533
ABOUT HIS POWER THAT SCARE ME

04:48:04.600 --> 04:48:08.137
AND HIS ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE IT

04:48:08.204 --> 04:48:11.240
SCARE ME EVEN MORE. AND THAT IS

04:48:11.307 --> 04:48:14.243
WHY I AM FINE WITH WHAT WE

04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:17.013
DEMOCRATS ARE DOING HERE TODAY

04:48:17.079 --> 04:48:20.783
IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE AS A

04:48:20.850 --> 04:48:23.352
MEMBER FROM PALMDALE SAID

04:48:23.419 --> 04:48:26.555
EARLIER IN ANOTHER DEBATE,

04:48:26.622 --> 04:48:27.123
GERRYMANDERING IS WRONG WHEN

04:48:27.189 --> 04:48:30.559
IT'S BENEFITING PEOPLE. WHEN

04:48:30.626 --> 04:48:32.128
YOU'RE DOING IT TO WRONGLY

04:48:32.194 --> 04:48:35.097
BENEFIT CERTAIN PEOPLE, YOU

04:48:35.164 --> 04:48:39.268
SHOULDN'T DO IT IN TEXAS IS ALL

04:48:39.335 --> 04:48:42.805
TOO WILLING TO REDRAW THE LINES

04:48:42.872 --> 04:48:47.476
WITHOUT VOTER INPUT. TO BENEFIT

04:48:47.543 --> 04:48:51.347
TRUMP, WHOSE POWER SCARES THE

04:48:51.414 --> 04:48:55.117
HELL OUT OF ME. THEY ARE NOT

04:48:55.184 --> 04:48:58.954
JUST ENABLING TRUMP. THEY ARE

04:48:59.021 --> 04:49:02.458
HANDING HIM THE KEYS, THE MAPS,

04:49:02.525 --> 04:49:08.831
AND THE SHARPIE. WE'RE EIGHT

04:49:08.898 --> 04:49:12.935
MONTHS IN, EIGHT MONTHS IN. NÓ

04:49:13.002 --> 04:49:15.171
DISASTER RELIEF. WHILE

04:49:15.237 --> 04:49:17.306
CALIFORNIANS HOMES LITERALLY

04:49:17.373 --> 04:49:20.276
BURN CUTS TO MEDICAID. I HEAR A

04:49:20.342 --> 04:49:22.645
LOT ABOUT HEALTH CARE CUTS TO

04:49:22.712 --> 04:49:23.612
MEDICAID THAT HURT THE POOREST

04:49:23.679 --> 04:49:27.349
OF CALIFORNIANS KIDS, SENIORS,

04:49:27.416 --> 04:49:29.552
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES,

04:49:29.618 --> 04:49:33.889
PUTTING THEM AT GREAT RISK.

04:49:33.956 --> 04:49:38.160
PUBLIC SCHOOLS DEFUNDED, CRUEL,

04:49:38.227 --> 04:49:39.762
POINTLESS IMMIGRATION RAIDS

04:49:39.829 --> 04:49:41.564
THAT SHOULD SCARE AND REALLY

04:49:41.630 --> 04:49:44.533
BOTHER ANYONE. IF YOU HAVE ANY

04:49:44.600 --> 04:49:48.304
EMPATHY AT ALL. TARIFFS THAT

04:49:48.370 --> 04:49:49.138
TANK SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE

04:49:49.205 --> 04:49:52.041
ALL CARE ABOUT, RAISE PRICES

04:49:52.108 --> 04:49:53.342
FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND THAT

04:49:53.409 --> 04:49:56.312
INCLUDES FOOD PRICES, COURTS

04:49:56.378 --> 04:50:00.583
STACKED WITH EXTREMISTS. THESE

04:50:00.649 --> 04:50:04.120
ARE YOUR STUPID PRIZES. THE

04:50:04.186 --> 04:50:05.421
STUPID PRIZES THAT I TALKED

04:50:05.488 --> 04:50:06.889
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY IN

04:50:06.956 --> 04:50:08.257
COMMITTEE. AND IT'S GOING TO

04:50:08.324 --> 04:50:10.359
GET WORSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO

04:50:10.426 --> 04:50:12.128
GET MORE, AND IT'S NOT GOING TO

04:50:12.194 --> 04:50:13.429
BE ON US BECAUSE WE ARE DOING

04:50:13.496 --> 04:50:16.599
EVERYTHING WE CAN IN CALIFORNIA

04:50:16.665 --> 04:50:19.201
TO STOP IT. WE'RE NOT DOING

04:50:19.268 --> 04:50:22.238
THIS TO THE PEOPLE. WE'RE DOING

04:50:22.304 --> 04:50:25.107
THIS WITH THE PEOPLE, AND WE

04:50:25.174 --> 04:50:27.042
ARE ASKING THE PEOPLE ON

04:50:27.109 --> 04:50:30.079
NOVEMBER 4TH TO VALIDATE OUR

04:50:30.146 --> 04:50:33.349
FEAR OF DONALD TRUMP'S POWER.

04:50:33.415 --> 04:50:37.386
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

04:50:37.453 --> 04:50:39.555
MEMBER STEPHANIE, ASSEMBLY

04:50:39.622 --> 04:50:40.589
MEMBER PATTERSON, YOU'RE

04:50:40.656 --> 04:50:44.260
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

04:50:44.326 --> 04:50:48.030
SPEAKER. YOU KNOW, I WAS

04:50:48.097 --> 04:50:49.198
FORTUNATE ENOUGH. I'M VERY

04:50:49.265 --> 04:50:51.333
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

04:50:51.400 --> 04:50:53.169
GO HOME EVERY DAY AND SEE MY

04:50:53.235 --> 04:50:55.371
FAMILY, KISS MY BABIES GOOD

04:50:55.437 --> 04:50:58.174
NIGHT, DROP THEM OFF AT SCHOOL.

04:50:58.240 --> 04:50:59.975
DESPITE MY COLLEAGUE TO MY LEFT,

04:51:00.042 --> 04:51:01.243
I'M ALWAYS MISS PRECESSION AT

04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:03.279
THE CAUCUS BECAUSE DROPPING MY

04:51:03.345 --> 04:51:05.314
KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL EVERY SINGLE

04:51:05.381 --> 04:51:09.418
DAY. YOU KNOW, I COME INTO THIS

04:51:09.485 --> 04:51:11.020
BUILDING AND I THINK ABOUT THE

04:51:11.086 --> 04:51:12.822
THINGS THAT WE'VE WORKED ON

04:51:12.888 --> 04:51:15.457
TOGETHER. SOCIAL MEDIA HARMS OF

04:51:15.524 --> 04:51:19.395
OUR CHILDREN, OVERPROCESSED

04:51:19.461 --> 04:51:22.498
FOODS THAT ARE CAUSING

04:51:22.565 --> 04:51:24.166
DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON OUR

04:51:24.233 --> 04:51:27.303
CHILDREN AND ALL OF US. COLON

04:51:27.369 --> 04:51:30.339
CANCER SCREENINGS THAT MIGHT

04:51:30.406 --> 04:51:35.945
NOT BE REQUIRED PRETTY SOON

04:51:36.011 --> 04:51:39.181
TOGETHER, HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET

04:51:39.248 --> 04:51:40.482
THAT DONE AND THROUGH THE

04:51:40.549 --> 04:51:42.218
FINISH LINE IF IT'S NOT VETOED

04:51:42.284 --> 04:51:44.987
AGAIN THIS YEAR. BUT THESE ARE

04:51:45.054 --> 04:51:46.388
THINGS WE'VE WORKED ON TOGETHER

04:51:46.455 --> 04:51:49.558
IN MANY, MANY OTHER THINGS. AND

04:51:49.625 --> 04:51:51.126
I JUST WONDER IF THERE'S A

04:51:51.193 --> 04:51:53.195
LITTLE BIT OF AMNESIA. ABOUT

04:51:53.262 --> 04:51:55.064
90% OF THE WORK THAT WE DO

04:51:55.130 --> 04:51:57.833
TOGETHER, REPUBLICANS AND

04:51:57.900 --> 04:51:59.034
DEMOCRATS, SOME OF THE THINGS

04:51:59.101 --> 04:52:01.570
JUST TO ADDRESS THE POINTS THAT

04:52:01.637 --> 04:52:04.006
HAVE BEEN MADE ON THIS FLOOR IS

04:52:04.073 --> 04:52:06.041
THAT REPUBLICANS JOINED

04:52:06.108 --> 04:52:09.411
TOGETHER WITH YOU TO PASS

04:52:09.478 --> 04:52:11.547
RESOLUTIONS ABOUT CUTS

04:52:11.614 --> 04:52:12.181
OCCURRING ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

04:52:12.248 --> 04:52:15.551
DOES ANYBODY REMEMBER THAT WE

04:52:15.618 --> 04:52:19.388
SUPPORTED MANY OF THOSE

04:52:19.455 --> 04:52:20.890
RESOLUTIONS, BUT YET WE'RE

04:52:20.956 --> 04:52:23.092
BEING ACCUSED OF NOT STANDING

04:52:23.158 --> 04:52:26.528
UP TO THE MAN OR BENDING AT THE

04:52:26.595 --> 04:52:30.866
KNEES, WHATEVER THAT MEANS. WE

04:52:30.933 --> 04:52:32.134
JOINED WITH YOU ON ISSUES LIKE

04:52:32.201 --> 04:52:36.038
THAT. REPUBLICANS AUTHORED A

04:52:36.105 --> 04:52:41.043
RESOLUTION TODAY SAYING THAT WE

04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:43.145
NEED INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

04:52:43.212 --> 04:52:47.316
EVERYWHERE. AND THE DEMOCRATS

04:52:47.383 --> 04:52:52.922
VOTED NO. THE REPUBLICAN LEADER

04:52:52.988 --> 04:52:56.025
OF OUR CAUCUS, ONE OF THE MOST

04:52:56.091 --> 04:52:57.559
CONSERVATIVE INDIVIDUALS THAT

04:52:57.626 --> 04:53:00.129
I'M PROUD TO SERVE WITH,

04:53:00.195 --> 04:53:04.800
ACTUALLY SAID IT WAS WRONG FOR

04:53:04.867 --> 04:53:05.801
REPUBLICANS IN THE PRESIDENT TO

04:53:05.868 --> 04:53:09.038
PRESSURE REDISTRICTING IN OTHER

04:53:09.104 --> 04:53:10.906
STATES. HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT.

04:53:10.973 --> 04:53:13.042
AND IT'S LIKE THE VERY NEXT

04:53:13.108 --> 04:53:14.643
SPEECH FROM A COLLEAGUE ON THE

04:53:14.710 --> 04:53:16.378
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. I HEAR

04:53:16.445 --> 04:53:18.247
ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS DON'T

04:53:18.314 --> 04:53:23.152
STAND UP TO THE PRESIDENT. ALL

04:53:23.218 --> 04:53:25.721
GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE

04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:26.555
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER

04:53:26.622 --> 04:53:30.459
WHO'S IN CHARGE. CAN HAVE

04:53:30.526 --> 04:53:33.195
PROBLEMS. BUT BEFORE WE LEFT

04:53:33.262 --> 04:53:37.266
FOR RECESS, GOVERNOR NEWSOM WAS

04:53:37.333 --> 04:53:38.200
TALKING HIS INITIAL STATEMENT

04:53:38.267 --> 04:53:40.636
ON THIS. HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO

04:53:40.703 --> 04:53:41.870
PUT THIS ON THE BALLOT. THAT

04:53:41.937 --> 04:53:43.872
WAS HIS INITIAL STATEMENT THAT

04:53:43.939 --> 04:53:45.374
HE WOULD JUST TELL YOU TO DO

04:53:45.441 --> 04:53:48.210
THIS. WELL, GUESS WHAT?

04:53:48.277 --> 04:53:50.446
SOMEBODY TOLD HIM THAT IT'S

04:53:50.512 --> 04:53:52.281
ACTUALLY GOT TO GO TO THE

04:53:52.348 --> 04:53:54.383
PEOPLE. BUT I REMEMBER MY

04:53:54.450 --> 04:53:56.118
PREDICTION THAT DAY. I ACTUALLY

04:53:56.185 --> 04:53:57.953
ON MY FAVORITE SOCIAL MEDIA

04:53:58.020 --> 04:53:59.421
PLATFORM WAS, MAKE NO MISTAKE

04:53:59.488 --> 04:54:02.091
ABOUT IT, IF GOVERNOR NEWSOM

04:54:02.157 --> 04:54:04.126
ASKS THE MAJORITY PARTY

04:54:04.193 --> 04:54:05.461
DEMOCRATS TO PASS THIS OUT OF

04:54:05.527 --> 04:54:08.230
THE BUILDING, THEY WILL PASS IT.

04:54:08.297 --> 04:54:11.066
AND HERE WE ARE DOING EXACTLY

04:54:11.133 --> 04:54:13.102
AS I PREDICTED. I DIDN'T NEED A

04:54:13.168 --> 04:54:17.172
CRYSTAL BALL. WHEN HE WANTED TO

04:54:17.239 --> 04:54:20.376
UNDERMINE PROPOSITION 36. DID

04:54:20.442 --> 04:54:23.379
ANYBODY SPEAK UP AND SAY, HEY,

04:54:23.445 --> 04:54:25.147
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S A BAD

04:54:25.214 --> 04:54:29.118
IDEA. VERY FEW OF YOU MAYBE

04:54:29.184 --> 04:54:31.553
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, BUT WHO

04:54:31.620 --> 04:54:32.321
DOESN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO

04:54:32.388 --> 04:54:34.556
SPEAK UP WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM

04:54:34.623 --> 04:54:37.393
SAYS CRAZY THINGS LIKE THAT

04:54:37.459 --> 04:54:40.195
UNDERMINING PROP 36? I DO AGAIN,

04:54:40.262 --> 04:54:41.230
I DON'T WANT TO BE LECTURED ON

04:54:41.296 --> 04:54:43.165
US NOT STANDING UP. WHO STOOD

04:54:43.232 --> 04:54:45.434
UP THERE? BY THE WAY, MOST OF

04:54:45.501 --> 04:54:47.069
MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS CHAMBER

04:54:47.136 --> 04:54:49.304
OPPOSE PROPOSITION 36, AND IT

04:54:49.371 --> 04:54:52.074
PASSED IN EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT.

04:54:52.141 --> 04:54:56.645
30S ASK YOURSELF, HAVE YOU EVEN

04:54:56.712 --> 04:54:58.981
VOTED AGAINST A MEMBER OF YOUR

04:54:59.048 --> 04:55:02.284
PARTY'S BILL? SOME OF YOU MAY

04:55:02.351 --> 04:55:05.154
HAVE. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE, BUT

04:55:05.220 --> 04:55:07.222
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. YOU YOU

04:55:07.289 --> 04:55:08.157
KILL IT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

04:55:08.223 --> 04:55:10.225
BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE THE

04:55:10.292 --> 04:55:12.428
COURAGE TO EVEN DO A NO VOTE.

04:55:12.494 --> 04:55:14.530
BY THE WAY, I HAVE VOTED

04:55:14.596 --> 04:55:16.932
AGAINST BAD REPUBLICAN BILLS.

04:55:16.999 --> 04:55:20.269
BUT PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR. DON'T

04:55:20.335 --> 04:55:22.171
LECTURE US ON WHO HAS THE

04:55:22.237 --> 04:55:23.338
COURAGE TO STAND UP, BECAUSE

04:55:23.405 --> 04:55:25.340
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU SAY ONE BAD

04:55:25.407 --> 04:55:27.709
WORD ON PUBLIC RECORD ABOUT THE

04:55:27.776 --> 04:55:28.343
GOVERNOR. WITH THAT, I ASK FOR

04:55:28.410 --> 04:55:32.848
A NO VOTE. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

04:55:32.915 --> 04:55:33.415
MEMBER. PATTERSON. ASSEMBLY

04:55:33.482 --> 04:55:35.084
MEMBER. LACKEY, YOU ARE

04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:43.592
RECOGNIZED. FOR THE FIRST TIME.

04:55:43.659 --> 04:55:46.628
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I'M NOT

04:55:46.695 --> 04:55:47.963
PROUD OF THE WAY WE SPENT OUR

04:55:48.030 --> 04:55:50.199
TIME THIS MORNING. I WOULD

04:55:50.265 --> 04:55:54.103
WE'VE SPENT THIS WHOLE. THIS

04:55:54.169 --> 04:55:59.308
WHOLE FLOOR EXPERIENCE. TALKING

04:55:59.374 --> 04:56:02.744
ABOUT. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

04:56:02.811 --> 04:56:06.582
AREN'T REALLY IN OUR PURVIEW.

04:56:06.648 --> 04:56:08.083
WE THINK THAT WE'RE PROXY

04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:11.587
CONGRESS PEOPLE TODAY. AND I

04:56:11.653 --> 04:56:14.323
THINK THAT'S MISPLACED. I THINK

04:56:14.389 --> 04:56:16.558
WE HAVE SOME VERY SEVERE

04:56:16.625 --> 04:56:18.260
PROBLEMS HERE IN THE STATE OF

04:56:18.327 --> 04:56:20.529
CALIFORNIA, AND WE HAVEN'T

04:56:20.596 --> 04:56:22.364
SPENT ONE MINUTE TALKING ABOUT

04:56:22.431 --> 04:56:27.136
THEM IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALL

04:56:27.202 --> 04:56:29.104
ADMIT IT'S NOT BROKEN HERE. WE

04:56:29.171 --> 04:56:31.073
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

04:56:31.140 --> 04:56:32.474
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION THAT

04:56:32.541 --> 04:56:34.409
WE'RE PROUD OF THE PROCESS, BUT

04:56:34.476 --> 04:56:37.246
WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF IT

04:56:37.312 --> 04:56:40.282
TEMPORARILY BECAUSE WE DON'T

04:56:40.349 --> 04:56:41.416
LIKE WHAT ANOTHER STATE IS

04:56:41.483 --> 04:56:44.753
DOING. IS THAT REALLY WHERE WE

04:56:44.820 --> 04:56:46.188
SHOULD BE SPENDING OUR TIME? I

04:56:46.255 --> 04:56:50.125
DON'T THINK SO. I THINK IT'S

04:56:50.192 --> 04:56:54.463
SAD THAT WE'VE LET THE

04:56:54.530 --> 04:56:57.032
CIRCUMSTANCES NATIONWIDE

04:56:57.099 --> 04:56:59.234
DISTRACT US FROM OUR REAL

04:56:59.301 --> 04:57:01.403
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THAT IS TO

04:57:01.470 --> 04:57:02.237
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

04:57:02.304 --> 04:57:05.407
RESIDENTS. WE HAVE VERY SEVERE

04:57:05.474 --> 04:57:07.075
AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS. WE HAVE

04:57:07.142 --> 04:57:07.943
INSURANCE PROBLEMS. WE HAVE ALL

04:57:08.010 --> 04:57:09.511
THESE CRISIS CIRCUMSTANCES WE

04:57:09.578 --> 04:57:11.079
DIDN'T SPEND ONE MINUTE ON

04:57:11.146 --> 04:57:14.249
TODAY. WE NEED TO BE BETTER

04:57:14.316 --> 04:57:15.184
THAN THAT. EVERYBODY. AND I'M

04:57:15.250 --> 04:57:17.286
NOT HERE TO INSULT ANYONE

04:57:17.352 --> 04:57:20.055
EITHER. I THINK THAT'S SHAMEFUL.

04:57:20.122 --> 04:57:21.890
I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL. WHEN WE

04:57:21.957 --> 04:57:23.492
POINT AT OTHER PEOPLE, WE MAKE

04:57:23.559 --> 04:57:25.561
THEM FEEL SMALL, OR AT LEAST

04:57:25.627 --> 04:57:27.229
TRY TO MAKE THEM FEEL SMALL.

04:57:27.296 --> 04:57:28.230
SHAME ON ALL OF YOU FOR DOING

04:57:28.297 --> 04:57:30.966
THAT. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S OUR

04:57:31.033 --> 04:57:32.067
PEOPLE OR YOUR SIDE OR OUR SIDE.

04:57:32.134 --> 04:57:34.203
WHY ARE WE DOING THAT? THE

04:57:34.269 --> 04:57:37.072
PEOPLE EXPECT BETTER FROM ALL

04:57:37.139 --> 04:57:40.776
OF US, AND I DON'T NORMALLY

04:57:40.842 --> 04:57:43.111
LIKE TO RAISE MY VOICE, BUT I'M

04:57:43.178 --> 04:57:44.313
TELLING YOU, EVERYBODY, WE ARE

04:57:44.379 --> 04:57:47.549
BETTER THAN THIS. I AM PROUD TO

04:57:47.616 --> 04:57:49.952
BELONG TO THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE,

04:57:50.018 --> 04:57:52.254
EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE THAT THINK

04:57:52.321 --> 04:57:54.156
LIKE ME ARE IN SMALL NUMBER.

04:57:54.223 --> 04:57:58.560
I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE

04:57:58.627 --> 04:58:00.829
CARE, BUT I THINK WE CAN ALSO

04:58:00.896 --> 04:58:02.264
BE DISTRACTED. AND THAT'S

04:58:02.331 --> 04:58:03.966
WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS MORNING.

04:58:04.032 --> 04:58:05.634
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. AND I

04:58:05.701 --> 04:58:07.469
HAD TO EXPRESS MY REGRETS ALONG

04:58:07.536 --> 04:58:09.104
THAT LINE. I HOPE WE CAN BE

04:58:09.171 --> 04:58:11.273
BETTER FROM HERE ON OUT. QUIT

04:58:11.340 --> 04:58:12.507
INSULTING PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE

04:58:12.574 --> 04:58:15.477
WITH YOU. MAKE YOUR POINT AND

04:58:15.544 --> 04:58:17.646
MAKE IT EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU.

04:58:17.713 --> 04:58:19.815
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:58:19.881 --> 04:58:22.884
LACKEY. SEEING AND HEARING NO

04:58:22.951 --> 04:58:24.286
FURTHER DEBATE. EXCUSE ME,

04:58:24.353 --> 04:58:26.221
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHULTZ, YOU'RE

04:58:26.288 --> 04:58:29.157
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

04:58:29.224 --> 04:58:30.492
MR. SPEAKER. I JUST WANTED TO

04:58:30.559 --> 04:58:32.427
ACTUALLY THANK MY COLLEAGUE

04:58:32.494 --> 04:58:33.295
FROM PALMDALE FOR HIS REMARKS.

04:58:33.362 --> 04:58:34.997
I THINK THAT DECORUM IS

04:58:35.063 --> 04:58:37.032
IMPORTANT IN THIS IN THIS

04:58:37.099 --> 04:58:39.001
DEBATE TODAY, IN RESPONSE TO MY

04:58:39.067 --> 04:58:40.435
COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKLIN, I WOULD

04:58:40.502 --> 04:58:42.170
SIMPLY SAY I HAVE VOTED NO ON A

04:58:42.237 --> 04:58:43.305
COLLEAGUE'S BILL. I HAVE

04:58:43.372 --> 04:58:44.273
DISAGREED WITH THE GOVERNOR,

04:58:44.339 --> 04:58:46.208
AND MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPLOITED

04:58:46.275 --> 04:58:47.876
THAT. TO BE VERY BLUNT, IN THE

04:58:47.943 --> 04:58:49.211
PAST, THE POINT I'M BRINGING UP

04:58:49.278 --> 04:58:51.747
IS THIS WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY

04:58:51.813 --> 04:58:52.281
TO DISAGREE WITHOUT BEING

04:58:52.347 --> 04:58:53.248
DISAGREEABLE. WE'RE NOT GOING

04:58:53.315 --> 04:58:55.384
TO SEE EYE TO EYE ON THIS ISSUE.

04:58:55.450 --> 04:58:57.085
I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND

04:58:57.152 --> 04:58:58.787
CHALLENGE OR QUESTION ANY OF

04:58:58.854 --> 04:58:59.421
YOUR INTEGRITY OR YOUR

04:58:59.488 --> 04:59:01.223
MOTIVATIONS. I THINK THAT WE

04:59:01.290 --> 04:59:02.190
HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MOVE

04:59:02.257 --> 04:59:04.226
FORWARD ON THE ISSUE. ACR HAS

04:59:04.293 --> 04:59:05.160
PASSED OUT OF THIS CHAMBER. I

04:59:05.227 --> 04:59:07.095
BELIEVE IT WILL PASS OUT OF THE

04:59:07.162 --> 04:59:09.264
SENATE AND IT WILL BE SIGNED BY

04:59:09.331 --> 04:59:10.098
OUR GOVERNOR. SB 280 IS A

04:59:10.165 --> 04:59:11.300
COMPANION PIECE OF LEGISLATION

04:59:11.366 --> 04:59:13.702
THAT WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY

04:59:13.769 --> 04:59:14.336
CALIFORNIANS VOICE CAN BE HEARD.

04:59:14.403 --> 04:59:16.271
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE PASS IT.

04:59:16.338 --> 04:59:18.140
I'LL BE VOTING AYE. AND I

04:59:18.206 --> 04:59:19.174
HUMBLY ASK ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO

04:59:19.241 --> 04:59:21.009
VOTE AYE. THANK YOU TO THE

YOU FOR THE ROBUST DEBATE ON

04:59:33.322 --> 04:59:35.257
THIS FLOOR TODAY. WHEN I WOKE

04:59:35.324 --> 04:59:37.359
UP THIS MORNING, I KNEW THIS

04:59:37.426 --> 04:59:40.028
WAS GOING TO BE A TOUGH,

04:59:40.095 --> 04:59:42.397
DIFFICULT DAY. AND IN LOOKING

04:59:42.464 --> 04:59:45.867
FOR INSPIRATION, I CAME ACROSS

04:59:45.934 --> 04:59:48.770
THIS WOODEN PEN I HAD IN MY

04:59:48.837 --> 04:59:52.341
CLOSET. THAT'S A MEMORIAL FROM

04:59:52.407 --> 04:59:56.345
THE HOLOCAUST THAT SIMPLY SAYS

04:59:56.411 --> 04:59:59.648
NEVER AGAIN. AND I THOUGHT

04:59:59.715 --> 05:00:03.018
ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN GERMANY IN

05:00:03.085 --> 05:00:08.957
1930, IN THOSE 53 DAYS THAT THE

05:00:09.024 --> 05:00:11.026
AUTHORITARIAN DICTATOR IN THEIR

05:00:11.093 --> 05:00:13.929
COUNTRY CHANGED THE COURSE OF

05:00:13.995 --> 05:00:18.200
HISTORY FOREVER, THAT RESULTED

05:00:18.266 --> 05:00:21.002
IN MILLIONS OF DEATHS OF

05:00:21.069 --> 05:00:25.741
INNOCENT JEWISH LIVES. WE ARE

05:00:25.807 --> 05:00:27.876
NOW AT THE 212TH DAY OF THIS

05:00:27.943 --> 05:00:30.612
ADMINISTRATION, AND WE HAVE

05:00:30.679 --> 05:00:32.981
BEEN FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE DAY

05:00:33.048 --> 05:00:35.917
FOR THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT

05:00:35.984 --> 05:00:39.154
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

05:00:39.221 --> 05:00:40.989
WE'VE BEEN PASSING LAWS, WE'VE

05:00:41.056 --> 05:00:43.458
BEEN PASSING RESOLUTIONS, AND

05:00:43.525 --> 05:00:44.893
WE'VE BEEN MAKING OUR VOICE

05:00:44.960 --> 05:00:47.696
HEARD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE

05:00:47.763 --> 05:00:50.031
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND AT THE

05:00:50.098 --> 05:00:53.568
END OF THIS DAY, THIS IS ABOUT

05:00:53.635 --> 05:00:55.437
THOSE PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE WE

05:00:55.504 --> 05:00:58.206
REPRESENT THAT LIVE IN OUR

05:00:58.273 --> 05:00:59.975
COMMUNITIES, THOSE HARD WORKING

05:01:00.041 --> 05:01:02.277
FAMILIES, THOSE THOSE MOMS

05:01:02.344 --> 05:01:04.413
STRUGGLING TO FIND AFFORDABLE

05:01:04.479 --> 05:01:06.281
DAYCARE. IT'S FOR OUR SENIORS,

05:01:06.348 --> 05:01:09.084
OUR VETERANS, OUR PERSONS WITH

05:01:09.151 --> 05:01:11.153
DISABILITIES, OUR IMMIGRANT

05:01:11.219 --> 05:01:13.355
FAMILIES WHO ARE OUT THERE

05:01:13.422 --> 05:01:15.590
MAKING SURE WE HAVE FOOD ON OUR

05:01:15.657 --> 05:01:18.427
TABLE, WHO WHO SERVE IN OUR

05:01:18.493 --> 05:01:19.561
HOSPITALITY INDUSTRIES, WHO

05:01:19.628 --> 05:01:21.763
PROVIDE THOSE VITAL HEALTH CARE

05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:24.166
SERVICES TO OUR LOVED ONES.

05:01:24.232 --> 05:01:27.068
THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERALDED

05:01:27.135 --> 05:01:30.939
AS HEROES DURING THE PANDEMIC,

05:01:31.006 --> 05:01:33.275
ARE NOW BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM

05:01:33.341 --> 05:01:36.044
THEIR FAMILIES, RIPPED AWAY AND

05:01:36.111 --> 05:01:38.580
PUT IN DETENTION CENTERS AND

05:01:38.647 --> 05:01:39.748
TREATED LIKE CRIMINALS WITHOUT

05:01:39.815 --> 05:01:44.953
DUE PROCESS. THIS IS ABOUT THE

05:01:45.020 --> 05:01:47.923
PEOPLE. THIS IS ABOUT OUR

05:01:47.989 --> 05:01:51.259
DEMOCRACY. AND WE CAN'T JUST

05:01:51.326 --> 05:01:53.028
FIGHT WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT

05:01:53.094 --> 05:01:57.666
NOW WITH THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS

05:01:57.732 --> 05:02:01.536
AND VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. WE

05:02:01.603 --> 05:02:04.206
MUST FIGHT THIS URGENT FIGHT.

05:02:04.272 --> 05:02:06.441
AND I'M SORRY WE DON'T HAVE

05:02:06.508 --> 05:02:08.043
MORE TIME. I WISH WE HAD MORE

05:02:08.109 --> 05:02:10.612
TIME, BUT TIME IS UP. TEXAS HAS

05:02:10.679 --> 05:02:13.081
TAKEN ITS ACTION AND CALIFORNIA

05:02:13.148 --> 05:02:14.983
WILL STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF

05:02:15.050 --> 05:02:16.518
CALIFORNIA. AND WE WILL HOLD

START THIS FIGHT, AND WE'VE

05:05:44.492 --> 05:05:48.063

05:07:28.563 --> 05:07:33.434
THE MAP. THE MAP? THAT'S THE

05:07:46.848 --> 05:07:47.315
USING MAPS. MR. SPEAKER,

05:07:47.382 --> 05:07:49.684
AGAINST THE RULES. THANK YOU.

05:07:49.751 --> 05:07:52.187
PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING PROPS.

05:07:52.253 --> 05:07:54.522
WE GET TO THE MAP. THE MURDER

05:07:54.589 --> 05:07:56.124
WEAPON OF DEMOCRACY IN

05:07:56.191 --> 05:07:57.892
CALIFORNIA. THE MURDER WEAPON

05:07:57.959 --> 05:08:00.094
THAT WILL END COMPETITIVE

05:08:00.161 --> 05:08:03.364
ELECTIONS. FAIR DISTRICTS.

05:08:03.431 --> 05:08:06.367
EXACTLY WHAT VOTERS SOUGHT TO

05:08:06.434 --> 05:08:08.269
PREVENT IN 2010 WHEN THEY TOOK

05:08:08.336 --> 05:08:10.171
THE POWER AWAY FROM YOU. AND

05:08:10.238 --> 05:08:11.840
WHAT DID YOU DO OVER THE LAST

05:08:11.906 --> 05:08:13.041
SEVERAL WEEKS? YOU PROVED THEM

05:08:13.107 --> 05:08:14.242
RIGHT, THAT YOU CANNOT BE

05:08:14.309 --> 05:08:16.344
TRUSTED TO SAFEGUARD OUR

05:08:16.411 --> 05:08:19.480
DEMOCRACY, TO GIVE US A VOICE.

05:08:19.547 --> 05:08:22.183
BECAUSE IF WE ADOPT THIS MAP,

05:08:22.250 --> 05:08:25.854
WE ARE SILENCING MILLIONS OF

05:08:25.920 --> 05:08:28.189
VOTERS. AND YOU SEEM TO BE

05:08:28.256 --> 05:08:29.357
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BECAUSE

05:08:29.424 --> 05:08:30.959
THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS.

05:08:31.025 --> 05:08:32.126
YOU'VE ALREADY LAID OUT YOUR

05:08:32.193 --> 05:08:33.828
YOUR ENDS. YOU DON'T LIKE

05:08:33.895 --> 05:08:34.996
DONALD TRUMP. WE GOT THE

05:08:35.063 --> 05:08:37.131
MESSAGE. YOU DON'T LIKE DONALD

05:08:37.198 --> 05:08:38.633
TRUMP. THAT'S WHAT ELECTIONS

05:08:38.700 --> 05:08:40.034
ARE FOR FAIR ELECTIONS, YOU GET

05:08:40.101 --> 05:08:41.169
TO STATE YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

05:08:41.236 --> 05:08:43.171
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET TO HEAR,

05:08:43.238 --> 05:08:44.072
THEY GET TO DECIDE. AND THEY

05:08:44.138 --> 05:08:46.274
DECIDED WHAT YOU COULD DO IS

05:08:46.341 --> 05:08:48.877
GET BACK TO WORK FOR

05:08:48.943 --> 05:08:50.111
CALIFORNIANS. BUT YOU'VE SPENT

05:08:50.178 --> 05:08:52.347
THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS FIGHTING

05:08:52.413 --> 05:08:54.048
THE GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

05:08:54.115 --> 05:08:55.617
RATHER THAN DOING THE JOB FOR

05:08:55.683 --> 05:08:56.851
THE CONSTITUENTS HERE IN

05:08:56.918 --> 05:08:57.919
CALIFORNIA. AND NOW YOU'RE

05:08:57.986 --> 05:09:00.121
GOING TO CONTINUE TO NOT DO

05:09:00.188 --> 05:09:02.323
YOUR JOB AND INSTEAD CALL AN

05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:03.124
UNNECESSARY SPECIAL ELECTION TO

05:09:03.191 --> 05:09:05.927
TRY TO CRAM THESE MAPS THROUGH.

05:09:05.994 --> 05:09:08.162
SO IT LEADS THE QUESTION. AND

05:09:08.229 --> 05:09:10.465
THERE'S A THERE ARE TWO REASONS

05:09:10.531 --> 05:09:11.499
WHY I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION,

05:09:11.566 --> 05:09:15.203
BUT IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION. WHO

05:09:15.270 --> 05:09:20.275
DREW THE MAPS? THIS IS A

05:09:20.341 --> 05:09:21.609
QUESTION THAT YOU'VE REFUSED TO

05:09:21.676 --> 05:09:24.913
ANSWER. THE REASON WHY WE ASK

05:09:24.979 --> 05:09:26.347
WHO DREW THE MAPS IS, NUMBER

05:09:26.414 --> 05:09:29.050
ONE, WE NEED TO KNOW WHO WHOSE

05:09:29.117 --> 05:09:32.153
INTEREST WAS BEHIND THESE MAPS.

05:09:32.220 --> 05:09:34.055
PERHAPS A SITTING STATE

05:09:34.122 --> 05:09:36.257
LEGISLATOR THAT WANTS TO CREATE

05:09:36.324 --> 05:09:37.892
THEIR OWN CONGRESSIONAL

05:09:37.959 --> 05:09:40.061
DISTRICT, OR PERHAPS A SPECIAL

05:09:40.128 --> 05:09:42.263
INTEREST THAT WANTS TO DILUTE

05:09:42.330 --> 05:09:44.065
THE VOICES OF CERTAIN

05:09:44.132 --> 05:09:46.601
CONSTITUENCIES. WE DESERVE TO

05:09:46.668 --> 05:09:48.269
KNOW WHO DREW THE MAPS, TO KNOW

05:09:48.336 --> 05:09:50.271
WHAT WAS THEIR INTEREST. BUT

05:09:50.338 --> 05:09:52.273
SECONDLY, I WANT TO KNOW WHO

05:09:52.340 --> 05:09:53.308
DREW THE MAPS, BECAUSE I WANT

05:09:53.374 --> 05:09:55.944
TO KNOW WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE.

05:09:56.010 --> 05:09:58.179
IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT, THERE

05:09:58.246 --> 05:10:00.248
IS THE CITIZENS INITIATIVE THAT

05:10:00.315 --> 05:10:02.617
WAS FILED EARLIER THIS WEEK,

05:10:02.684 --> 05:10:04.819
THE POISON PILL TO HOLD

05:10:04.886 --> 05:10:07.422
POLITICIANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

05:10:07.488 --> 05:10:08.756
TRYING TO SUBVERT THE WILL OF

05:10:08.823 --> 05:10:10.224
THE VOTERS, TO OVERTURN THE

05:10:10.291 --> 05:10:11.225
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

05:10:11.292 --> 05:10:13.428
COMMISSION. THAT INITIATIVE

05:10:13.494 --> 05:10:16.097
WOULD BAR ANYONE WHO VOTED FOR

THANK YOU. MR. SPEAKER. WOULD

05:10:27.375 --> 05:10:29.243
ASK THE SPEAKER AT THE TIME TO

05:10:29.310 --> 05:10:30.745
DIRECT HIS COMMENTS TO THE BILL

05:10:30.812 --> 05:10:31.946
AND NOT ANYTHING EXTERNAL TO

05:10:32.013 --> 05:10:33.948
OUR PROCESS TODAY. THANK YOU.

05:10:34.015 --> 05:10:35.350
THANK YOU, MR. SCHULTZ. YOUR

05:10:35.416 --> 05:10:37.652

05:10:38.252 --> 05:10:39.487
MERITS OF THE LEGISLATION. WELL,

05:10:39.554 --> 05:10:40.922
I'M TRYING TO GET THE WHO

05:10:40.989 --> 05:10:42.123
BECAUSE IN THE ABSENCE OF

05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:43.458
KNOWING WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE

05:10:43.524 --> 05:10:45.994
FOR THIS GERRYMANDERED MAP, WE

05:10:46.060 --> 05:10:50.064
MUST HOLD EVERYONE INVOLVED IN

05:10:50.131 --> 05:10:53.201
THE CALL IT A CONSPIRACY, A

05:10:53.267 --> 05:10:54.969
COLLUSION, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

05:10:55.036 --> 05:10:57.538
CALL IT, THE EFFORT TO SUBVERT

05:10:57.605 --> 05:11:01.309
DEMOCRACY. THIS MAP IS PARTIZAN.

05:11:01.376 --> 05:11:03.277
YOU ADMIT IT'S PARTIZAN. YOU

05:11:03.344 --> 05:11:05.279
WANT TO SEIZE CONGRESSIONAL

05:11:05.346 --> 05:11:07.248
DISTRICTS FOR YOUR PARTY. THIS

05:11:07.315 --> 05:11:09.150
MAP IS SELF-SERVING. A NUMBER

05:11:09.217 --> 05:11:11.352
OF LEGISLATORS ALLEGEDLY ARE

05:11:11.419 --> 05:11:12.220
GOING TO GET CONGRESSIONAL

05:11:12.286 --> 05:11:15.089
DISTRICTS DRAWN FOR THEMSELVES.

05:11:15.156 --> 05:11:17.291
THIS MAP SILENCES THE VOICES OF

05:11:17.358 --> 05:11:19.127
COMMUNITIES, CITIES AND

05:11:19.193 --> 05:11:20.895
COUNTIES BY SPLITTING THEM UP.

05:11:20.962 --> 05:11:23.197
AND I HAVE A COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

05:11:23.264 --> 05:11:25.566
BERNARDINO WHO LIKES TO ALWAYS

05:11:25.633 --> 05:11:28.136
TELL US HOW HE FIGHTS FOR THE

05:11:28.202 --> 05:11:30.238
TRIBES. BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT

05:11:30.304 --> 05:11:32.106
THIS MAP SPLITS TRIBAL

05:11:32.173 --> 05:11:34.342
RESERVATIONS? DID YOU KNOW THAT?

05:11:34.409 --> 05:11:35.176
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW THAT.

05:11:35.243 --> 05:11:36.277
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BOTHERED TO

05:11:36.344 --> 05:11:38.713
LOOK AT THE MAP. MOST OF YOU,

05:11:38.780 --> 05:11:40.081
AGUA CALIENTE IS SPLIT. SANTA

05:11:40.148 --> 05:11:43.918

MESA GRANDE SPLIT. SEQUOIA

05:11:49.524 --> 05:11:51.592

MORONGO TRIBE. SPLIT. ROUND.

05:11:57.365 --> 05:12:00.868
VALLEY TRIBE. SPLIT. DID YOU

05:12:00.935 --> 05:12:03.004
BOTHER TO CONSULT THE NATIVE

05:12:03.071 --> 05:12:04.105
AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS WITH

05:12:04.172 --> 05:12:06.574
SOVEREIGNTY? NO. I CHECKED WITH

05:12:06.641 --> 05:12:08.042
SEVERAL OF THEIR

05:12:08.109 --> 05:12:09.677
REPRESENTATIVES. NOT A SINGLE

05:12:09.744 --> 05:12:12.647
CALL. BUT YOU SPLIT THOSE

05:12:12.713 --> 05:12:14.515
TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS, SCATTERING

05:12:14.582 --> 05:12:16.651
THEM ACROSS DIFFERENT

05:12:16.717 --> 05:12:17.218
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. SO

05:12:17.285 --> 05:12:20.655
MUCH FOR MINORITY RIGHTS. SO

05:12:20.721 --> 05:12:21.823
MUCH FOR THE VOICE OF THE

05:12:21.889 --> 05:12:24.225
PEOPLE. 30S. WE WANT TO KNOW

05:12:24.292 --> 05:12:26.094
WHO DREW THE MAPS, BUT IN THE

05:12:26.160 --> 05:12:27.962
ABSENCE OF THAT, I WILL TELL

05:12:28.029 --> 05:12:30.131
EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN IN THE

05:12:30.198 --> 05:12:32.700
NEXT SEVEN WEEKS AS WE EDUCATE

05:12:32.767 --> 05:12:34.602
THEM AS TO WHAT REALLY THIS

05:12:34.669 --> 05:12:36.437
INITIATIVE DOES. YOU WANT TO

05:12:36.504 --> 05:12:37.472
HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE, HOLD

05:12:37.538 --> 05:12:40.174
THE MAJORITY PARTY ACCOUNTABLE

05:12:40.241 --> 05:12:43.010
FOR EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR THIS,

05:12:43.077 --> 05:12:44.579
WHO WASTED OUR MONEY. AND BY

05:12:44.645 --> 05:12:46.080
THE WAY, MR. NEWSOM, WHEN YOUR

05:12:46.147 --> 05:12:48.883
CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT ENDS,

05:12:48.950 --> 05:12:51.085
KINDLY TRANSFER YOUR CAMPAIGN

05:12:51.152 --> 05:12:52.186
TREASURY OVER TO THE STATE OF

05:12:52.253 --> 05:12:54.455
CALIFORNIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

05:12:54.522 --> 05:12:55.756
DEMAIO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

05:12:55.823 --> 05:12:56.257
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMAYO,

05:12:56.324 --> 05:12:58.726
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, YOU ARE

05:12:58.793 --> 05:13:00.928
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

05:13:00.995 --> 05:13:04.532
SPEAKER. SO THIS IS HOW LIBERTY

05:13:04.599 --> 05:13:06.868
DIES WITH THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.

05:13:06.934 --> 05:13:08.970
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN. THAT'S

05:13:09.036 --> 05:13:11.139
THE ACTIONS WE'VE HAD TODAY. I

05:13:11.205 --> 05:13:13.975
GREW UP ALWAYS IN A TOXIC

05:13:14.041 --> 05:13:16.144
RELATIONSHIP AND AN ABUSIVE

05:13:16.210 --> 05:13:16.978
RELATIONSHIP. YOU COULD SEE IT

05:13:17.044 --> 05:13:19.413
FROM 100 MILES AWAY. WHEN YOU

05:13:19.480 --> 05:13:21.115
HIDE BEHIND PLATITUDES AND

05:13:21.182 --> 05:13:24.318
PERCENTAGES. WHEN WE'RE SAYING

05:13:24.385 --> 05:13:26.087
THAT 76% OF THIS MAP REMAINS

05:13:26.154 --> 05:13:29.157
THE SAME, THAT MEANS 24%. BUT

05:13:29.223 --> 05:13:31.058
IN RAW NUMBERS, THAT MEANS 10

05:13:31.125 --> 05:13:34.228
MILLION CALIFORNIANS. 24% OF

05:13:34.295 --> 05:13:38.933
THIS MAP IS ONLY OF HUGE

05:13:39.000 --> 05:13:40.935
MAJORITY OF THIS STATE.

05:13:41.002 --> 05:13:43.204
REPUBLICANS ONLY REPRESENT 18%.

05:13:43.271 --> 05:13:45.973
SO THAT MEANS 100% OF THE

05:13:46.040 --> 05:13:47.441
REPUBLICAN REPRESENTED.

05:13:47.508 --> 05:13:48.543
REPRESENTATION IN THIS STATE

05:13:48.609 --> 05:13:53.281
HAS CHANGED. WE CAN SEE IT. WE

05:13:53.347 --> 05:13:57.185
SEE THE TOXIC RELATIONSHIP, THE

05:13:57.251 --> 05:13:58.352
GASLIGHTING COMING OUT OF THIS

05:13:58.419 --> 05:14:00.388
LEGISLATIVE BODY, AND WE'RE

05:14:00.454 --> 05:14:02.123
LOSING TRANSPARENCY THAT WAS

05:14:02.190 --> 05:14:03.491
BUILT UNDER THE CITIZENS

05:14:03.558 --> 05:14:05.159
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION ON HOW

05:14:05.226 --> 05:14:06.928
MAPS ARE ALLOCATED. PEOPLE LOVE

05:14:06.994 --> 05:14:10.498
THE PEOPLE, MAY NOT HAVE ALWAYS

05:14:10.565 --> 05:14:11.399
LOVED EVERY OUTCOME, BUT THEY

05:14:11.465 --> 05:14:14.669
KNEW THE PROCESS WAS OPEN AND

05:14:14.735 --> 05:14:15.536
THEY KNEW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE.

05:14:15.603 --> 05:14:17.038
BUT WITH THE MAPS BEFORE US

05:14:17.104 --> 05:14:18.206
TODAY, WE CAN'T SAY THE SAME

05:14:18.272 --> 05:14:20.374
THING. IN FACT, WE CAN'T ANSWER

05:14:20.441 --> 05:14:23.477
THE MOST BASIC QUESTION WHO

05:14:23.544 --> 05:14:26.347
DREW THE MAPS? WHICH WHO

05:14:26.414 --> 05:14:27.315
DECIDED WHICH CITIES SHOULD BE

05:14:27.381 --> 05:14:29.383
KEPT WHOLE AND WHICH SHOULD BE

05:14:29.450 --> 05:14:31.285
DIVIDED? WHO MADE THE JUDGMENT

05:14:31.352 --> 05:14:33.221
CALL ABOUT WHERE COMMUNITIES OF

05:14:33.287 --> 05:14:34.055
INTEREST BEGIN AND END? I ASKED

05:14:34.121 --> 05:14:36.023
NINE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND

05:14:36.090 --> 05:14:38.125
GOT NINE DIFFERENT ANSWERS. WAS

05:14:38.192 --> 05:14:40.061
IT THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL

05:14:40.127 --> 05:14:41.062
CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE AS REPORTED

05:14:41.128 --> 05:14:42.330
BY THE MEDIA? WAS IT PAUL

05:14:42.396 --> 05:14:44.632
MITCHELL AND SPECIAL INTERESTS?

05:14:44.699 --> 05:14:46.234
AS STATED IN A PODCAST? WAS IT

05:14:46.300 --> 05:14:47.368
DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP AS STATED

05:14:47.435 --> 05:14:49.003
BY MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

05:14:49.070 --> 05:14:50.571
ELECTION COMMITTEE, OR IS IT

05:14:50.638 --> 05:14:51.906
THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE

05:14:51.973 --> 05:14:54.075
ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AS WRITTEN

05:14:54.141 --> 05:14:56.911
IN THE BILL? YOU COULDN'T EVEN

05:14:56.978 --> 05:14:58.145
SAY THAT. AND IT'S IN THE

05:14:58.212 --> 05:14:59.880
LEGISLATION THAT SOMEHOW IT WAS

05:14:59.947 --> 05:15:02.516
PREPARED BY ME ON THE ELECTIONS

05:15:02.583 --> 05:15:03.251
COMMITTEE COULDN'T EVEN GET

05:15:03.317 --> 05:15:07.121
THAT PART RIGHT. THE LACK OF

05:15:07.188 --> 05:15:08.155
AUTHORSHIP AND THE LACK OF

05:15:08.222 --> 05:15:09.457
TRANSPARENCY SHOULD TROUBLE

05:15:09.523 --> 05:15:11.125
EVERY CALIFORNIAN. REGARDLESS

05:15:11.192 --> 05:15:13.628
OF YOUR POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES.

05:15:13.694 --> 05:15:15.096
NORMALLY, WHEN THE COMMISSION

05:15:15.162 --> 05:15:17.064
DOES ITS WORK, THERE ARE DOZENS

05:15:17.131 --> 05:15:18.633
AND DOZENS OF POLITICAL

05:15:18.699 --> 05:15:19.467
HEARINGS. THERE ARE TRANSCRIPTS,

05:15:19.533 --> 05:15:21.435
THERE ARE RECORDED VOTES. THERE

05:15:21.502 --> 05:15:22.136
ARE EXPLANATIONS OF CRITERIA,

05:15:22.203 --> 05:15:24.438
DETAILS ABOUT COMPETING

05:15:24.505 --> 05:15:26.340
PRIORITIES. HERE. THERE IS

05:15:26.407 --> 05:15:28.943
NOTHING. THESE MAPS SIMPLY

05:15:29.010 --> 05:15:31.512
APPEARED HANDED TO US IN THE

05:15:31.579 --> 05:15:33.080
11TH, IN THE 11TH HOUR, EVEN AS

05:15:33.147 --> 05:15:35.116
WE AS IF WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE

05:15:35.182 --> 05:15:36.484
THEM ON FAITH. BUT DEMOCRACY

05:15:36.550 --> 05:15:38.452
DOESN'T RUN ON FAITH. IT RUNS

05:15:38.519 --> 05:15:40.121
ON ACCOUNTABILITY. IF WE CANNOT

05:15:40.187 --> 05:15:41.422
POINT TO THE PEOPLE WHO DREW

05:15:41.489 --> 05:15:43.157
THE LINES, HOW CAN THE VOTERS

05:15:43.224 --> 05:15:44.358
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEM? AND

05:15:44.425 --> 05:15:45.993
LET US LOOK AT THESE MAPS.

05:15:46.060 --> 05:15:47.228
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THESE MAPS

05:15:47.295 --> 05:15:49.196
DO. IN CITY AFTER CITY,

05:15:49.263 --> 05:15:50.398
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE CARVED UP

05:15:50.464 --> 05:15:51.098
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE FOUGHT

05:15:51.165 --> 05:15:52.233
FOR DECADES TO HAVE THEIR

05:15:52.300 --> 05:15:54.335
VOICES HEARD, SPLIT ALL INTO

05:15:54.402 --> 05:15:55.936
PIECES. AND LET ME ASK THIS

05:15:56.003 --> 05:15:57.271
PLAINLY HOW DOES IT BENEFIT A

05:15:57.338 --> 05:15:59.307
CITY TO BE BROKEN INTO SMALL

05:15:59.373 --> 05:16:00.474
FRAGMENTS ACROSS MULTIPLE

05:16:00.541 --> 05:16:02.176
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS? DOES

05:16:02.243 --> 05:16:03.477
FRESNO GAIN STRENGTH BY BEING

05:16:03.544 --> 05:16:05.012
CUT INTO FOUR DIFFERENT SEATS,

05:16:05.079 --> 05:16:07.748
OR DOES IT SIMPLY DILUTE THE

05:16:07.815 --> 05:16:10.051
VOICES OF ITS RESIDENTS? WE ARE

05:16:10.117 --> 05:16:12.553
TOLD THAT THESE MAPS PROTECT

05:16:12.620 --> 05:16:12.987
CALIFORNIANS AGAINST

05:16:13.054 --> 05:16:14.021
GERRYMANDERING IN OTHER STATES.

05:16:14.088 --> 05:16:16.557
YOU REMOVE THAT LANGUAGE THIS

05:16:16.624 --> 05:16:17.391
MORNING AND DIDN'T EVEN TELL

05:16:17.458 --> 05:16:21.929
ANYBODY. BUT SECRECY IS IN ITS

05:16:21.996 --> 05:16:23.164
OWN FORM OF GERRYMANDERING.

05:16:23.230 --> 05:16:25.066
WHEN LINES ARE DRAWN BEHIND

05:16:25.132 --> 05:16:26.067
CLOSED DOORS, WITHOUT

05:16:26.133 --> 05:16:27.101
EXPLANATION, WITHOUT

05:16:27.168 --> 05:16:28.469
PARTICIPATION, AND WITHOUT

05:16:28.536 --> 05:16:30.137
ACCOUNTABILITY, WE INVITE THE

05:16:30.204 --> 05:16:32.006
VERY ABUSE OUR COMMISSION, THE

05:16:32.073 --> 05:16:35.843
GOLD STANDARD, WAS SET OUT TO

05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:39.213
PREVENT. SO I ASK THIS AGAIN

05:16:39.280 --> 05:16:41.082
WHO DREW THE MAPS? WHY WON'T

05:16:41.148 --> 05:16:43.217
ANYBODY SAY IT? IF THIS IS

05:16:43.284 --> 05:16:45.086
TRULY ABOUT FAIRNESS, WHY NOT

05:16:45.152 --> 05:16:46.187
ALLOW THE CITIZENS

05:16:46.253 --> 05:16:47.388
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION, WHICH

05:16:47.455 --> 05:16:49.490
VOTERS CREATED PRECISELY FOR

05:16:49.557 --> 05:16:51.125
THIS PERSON TO DO ITS JOB? WHY

05:16:51.192 --> 05:16:54.295
RUSH? WHY THE SECRECY? AT THE

05:16:54.362 --> 05:16:55.296
END OF THE DAY, CALIFORNIANS

05:16:55.363 --> 05:16:57.164
DESERVE TO KNOW WHO IS DRAWING

05:16:57.231 --> 05:16:58.999
THE LINES THAT WILL SHAPE THEIR

05:16:59.066 --> 05:17:00.368
COMMUNITIES FOR THE NEXT DECADE.

05:17:00.434 --> 05:17:02.536
THEY DESERVE TO SEE THE PROCESS

05:17:02.603 --> 05:17:03.804
THAT THE PROCESS AND TRUST THAT

05:17:03.871 --> 05:17:06.073
IS FAIR. ANYTHING LESS

05:17:06.140 --> 05:17:08.142
UNDERMINES THE VERY FOUNDATION

05:17:08.209 --> 05:17:10.611
OF A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT.

05:17:10.678 --> 05:17:13.013
OUR VOTES CREATED THE CITIZENS

05:17:13.080 --> 05:17:13.514
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION

05:17:13.581 --> 05:17:15.149
BECAUSE THEY WANTED FAIR MAPS,

05:17:15.216 --> 05:17:16.350
NOT POLITICAL MAPS. THEY WANTED

05:17:16.417 --> 05:17:18.352
A PROCESS THAT BELONGS TO THEM,

05:17:18.419 --> 05:17:20.154
NOT POLITICIANS, NOT INSIDERS,

05:17:20.221 --> 05:17:21.956
AND CERTAINLY NOT PARTIZAN.

05:17:22.022 --> 05:17:23.224
ANONYMOUS MAPMAKERS WORKING IN

05:17:23.290 --> 05:17:25.192
THE SHADOWS CALIFORNIA SHOULD

05:17:25.259 --> 05:17:27.228
REMAIN A MODEL FOR DEMOCRACY,

05:17:27.294 --> 05:17:29.397
NOT A CAUTIONARY TALE. 30S. IF

05:17:29.463 --> 05:17:31.198
WE ACCEPT MAPS WITH NO KNOWN

05:17:31.265 --> 05:17:32.166
AUTHORS AND NO KNOWN

05:17:32.233 --> 05:17:33.334
ACCOUNTABILITY, IT DOESN'T

05:17:33.401 --> 05:17:35.269
MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SAY

05:17:35.336 --> 05:17:37.238
THE WORD TRANSPARENCY, THERE IS

05:17:37.304 --> 05:17:42.209
NONE. THE SAYING GOES, AS

05:17:42.276 --> 05:17:44.078
CALIFORNIA GOES, SO GOES THE

05:17:44.145 --> 05:17:46.213
NATION. BUT PASSING THIS BILL,

05:17:46.280 --> 05:17:49.083
IT WILL NOW BE AS TEXAS GOES,

05:17:49.150 --> 05:17:51.318
SO GOES CALIFORNIA. AND FOR

05:17:51.385 --> 05:17:52.553
THOSE REASONS, I RESPECTFULLY

05:17:52.620 --> 05:17:55.156
ASK YOU TO LEAD THIS NATION BY

05:17:55.222 --> 05:17:56.924
EXAMPLE AND VOTE NO ON THESE

05:17:56.991 --> 05:17:59.693
MAPS BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN

05:17:59.760 --> 05:18:01.962
KNOW WHO DID THEM.

05:18:02.029 --> 05:18:03.531
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. MOSQUITO,

05:18:03.597 --> 05:18:05.900
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

05:18:05.966 --> 05:18:09.537
MADAM CHAIR. I'M NOT SURE HOW

05:18:09.603 --> 05:18:10.271
MANY OF YOU WATCHED THE

05:18:10.337 --> 05:18:11.005
ELECTIONS COMMITTEE THIS WEEK,

05:18:11.071 --> 05:18:13.107
SO I WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH A

05:18:13.174 --> 05:18:14.275
FEW VERY KEY THINGS THAT

05:18:14.341 --> 05:18:16.043
HAPPENED. FIRST, THERE WAS AN

05:18:16.110 --> 05:18:18.646
ATTORNEY THERE TO BE A WITNESS.

05:18:18.712 --> 05:18:22.049
I ASKED HIM, WHO ARE YOU HERE

05:18:22.116 --> 05:18:23.918
ON BEHALF OF? HE INFORMED ME

05:18:23.984 --> 05:18:25.219
THAT WAS PROTECTED BY ATTORNEY

05:18:25.286 --> 05:18:28.222
CLIENT PRIVILEGE. I ASKED HIM,

05:18:28.289 --> 05:18:30.090
WHO IS PAYING YOU TO BE HERE?

05:18:30.157 --> 05:18:32.293
ONCE AGAIN? HE WOULDN'T ANSWER

05:18:32.359 --> 05:18:35.463
THAT QUESTION. SO THEN I ASKED,

05:18:35.529 --> 05:18:38.299
ARE YOU BEING PAID TO BE HERE?

05:18:38.365 --> 05:18:39.633
ONCE AGAIN, HE DIDN'T ANSWER

05:18:39.700 --> 05:18:42.303
THAT QUESTION. SO THEN, AS MY

05:18:42.369 --> 05:18:44.205
COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED, I ASKED

05:18:44.271 --> 05:18:45.706
THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL AND

05:18:45.773 --> 05:18:49.210
SIMPLEST OF QUESTIONS WHO DREW

05:18:49.276 --> 05:18:51.512
THE MAPS? SO LET ME SHARE THE

05:18:51.579 --> 05:18:54.715
ANSWERS I WAS SHARED WITH.

05:18:54.782 --> 05:18:57.618
FIRST IT WAS ASSEMBLY. HERE WE

05:18:57.685 --> 05:18:59.353
ARE. PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

05:18:59.420 --> 05:19:01.055
IF YOU DREW THE MAPS, DIDN'T

05:19:01.121 --> 05:19:04.658
SEE ONE GO IN THE AIR. SO THEN

05:19:04.725 --> 05:19:05.793
I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE

05:19:05.860 --> 05:19:08.229
LEGISLATURE. ONCE AGAIN. HERE

05:19:08.295 --> 05:19:09.997
WE ARE. I'M PART OF THE

05:19:10.064 --> 05:19:11.365
LEGISLATURE. I DIDN'T DRAW

05:19:11.432 --> 05:19:14.535
THESE MAPS. SO THEN I WAS

05:19:14.602 --> 05:19:17.037
MOCKED FOR NOT BEING A PART OF

05:19:17.104 --> 05:19:19.006
LEADERSHIP. THAT LEADERSHIP AND

05:19:19.073 --> 05:19:20.307
THE LEADERSHIP TEAM DREW THESE

05:19:20.374 --> 05:19:24.445
MAPS. THE LEADERSHIP TEAMS HERE,

05:19:24.512 --> 05:19:27.314
ANYBODY WANT TO OWN UP TO IT?

05:19:27.381 --> 05:19:29.083
OUR MAJORITY LEADER ADMITTED

05:19:29.149 --> 05:19:31.318
SHE DID NOT DIRECTLY DRAW THESE

05:19:31.385 --> 05:19:37.625
MAPS. AND SHE IS LEADERSHIP. IS

05:19:37.691 --> 05:19:38.225
THIS THE TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY

05:19:38.292 --> 05:19:40.427
YOU'RE PROMISING VOTERS THAT I

05:19:40.494 --> 05:19:43.764
WAS MOCKED FOR ASKING THAT

05:19:43.831 --> 05:19:45.900
QUESTION? YOU'RE NOT MOCKING ME.

05:19:45.966 --> 05:19:48.402
YOU'RE MOCKING VOTERS BY NOT

05:19:48.469 --> 05:19:53.207
ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. THESE

05:19:53.274 --> 05:19:55.209
MAPS IN THE LANGUAGE IT SAYS,

05:19:55.276 --> 05:19:56.443
THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS

05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:58.679
COMMITTEE WROTE IT. THAT IS,

05:19:58.746 --> 05:20:02.116
SEVEN PEOPLE, SEVEN ME AND MY

05:20:02.182 --> 05:20:03.984
COLLEAGUE CAN SAY WE DID NOT

05:20:04.051 --> 05:20:05.819
PARTICIPATE IN THE DRAWING OF

05:20:05.886 --> 05:20:08.455
THESE MAPS. SO I AM ASKING THAT

05:20:08.522 --> 05:20:10.424
THIS IS FACTUALLY INCORRECT IN

05:20:10.491 --> 05:20:11.992
THE BILL, AND I AM ASKING THE

05:20:12.059 --> 05:20:14.161
AUTHOR TO REMOVE THE WORDS THE

05:20:14.228 --> 05:20:15.729
ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE

05:20:15.796 --> 05:20:17.097
AND INCLUDE THE DEMOCRAT

05:20:17.164 --> 05:20:18.899
COLLEAGUES ON THAT COMMITTEE

05:20:18.966 --> 05:20:20.100
THAT ARE WILLING TO PUT THEIR

05:20:20.167 --> 05:20:22.303
NAMES ON PAPER, THAT THEY DREW

05:20:22.369 --> 05:20:24.204
THESE MAPS BECAUSE I WILL NOT

05:20:24.271 --> 05:20:25.940
BE INCLUDED IN THE DEBAUCHERY

05:20:26.006 --> 05:20:27.908
THAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE

05:20:27.975 --> 05:20:44.725
DRAWING OF THESE MAPS. QUESTION.

05:20:44.792 --> 05:20:47.261
ARE YOU REQUESTING TO ASK A

05:20:47.328 --> 05:20:48.996
QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR? I'M

05:20:49.063 --> 05:20:50.197
REQUESTING THAT THE AUTHOR

05:20:50.264 --> 05:20:51.298
TAKES THE AMENDMENT THAT WE

05:20:51.365 --> 05:20:52.700
REMOVE THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS

05:20:52.766 --> 05:20:54.234
COMMITTEE LANGUAGE. BECAUSE I

05:20:54.301 --> 05:20:56.403
DO NOT WANT. I'M ONE OF SEVEN

05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:58.005
PEOPLE. THAT IS A SMALL GROUP

05:20:58.072 --> 05:20:59.673
OF PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE LUMPED

05:20:59.740 --> 05:21:01.008
ME IN WITH WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN

05:21:01.075 --> 05:21:03.210
KNOW MY MEMBER PORTAL DID NOT

05:21:03.277 --> 05:21:05.245
EVEN SAY THAT I HAD AN

05:21:05.312 --> 05:21:06.080
ELECTIONS COMMITTEE HEARING

05:21:06.146 --> 05:21:08.248
UNTIL 20, LESS THAN 24 HOURS

05:21:08.315 --> 05:21:09.950
BEFORE THE HEARING.

05:21:10.017 --> 05:21:11.185
CONCURRENCES CANNOT BE AMENDED.

05:21:11.251 --> 05:21:13.220
THEN I AM ASKING A QUESTION OF

05:21:13.287 --> 05:21:15.055
THE AUTHOR. I WILL ADDRESS.

05:21:15.122 --> 05:21:16.190
WITHOUT OBJECTION. I WILL

05:21:16.256 --> 05:21:18.826
ADDRESS THIS IN MY CLOSING.

05:21:18.892 --> 05:21:20.661
THANK YOU. THIS IS NOT

05:21:20.728 --> 05:21:22.830
TRANSPARENCY AND YOU KNOW IT'S

05:21:22.896 --> 05:21:25.065
NOT. YOU CAN STAND HERE AND

05:21:25.132 --> 05:21:27.434
ADMONISH US ALL DAY LONG. BUT

05:21:27.501 --> 05:21:29.203
THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO YOUR

05:21:29.269 --> 05:21:31.405
ENTIRE LECTURE TODAY THAT THIS

05:21:31.472 --> 05:21:33.641
IS THE MOST TRANSPARENT PROCESS.

05:21:33.707 --> 05:21:35.576
THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE

05:21:35.643 --> 05:21:37.077
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE MAPS

05:21:37.144 --> 05:21:40.180
HAD BEEN AMENDED. AND YOU WANT

05:21:40.247 --> 05:21:42.850
TO SAY THAT THE ELECTIONS

05:21:42.916 --> 05:21:45.519
COMMITTEE DRAFTED THESE MAPS?

05:21:45.586 --> 05:21:48.155
THIS IS WRONG. THIS IS DECEIT.

05:21:48.222 --> 05:21:50.691
AND I WILL MAKE SURE THE VOTERS

05:21:50.758 --> 05:21:52.126
KNOW THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER, FOR

05:21:52.192 --> 05:21:54.928
YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

05:21:54.995 --> 05:21:56.397
MADAM SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES,

05:21:56.463 --> 05:21:58.198
THERE'S BEEN A LOT SAID TODAY

05:21:58.265 --> 05:21:59.533
AND I'LL KEEP MY REMARKS VERY

05:21:59.600 --> 05:22:02.536
SHORT. THERE'S A LOT OF

05:22:02.603 --> 05:22:06.473
EMOTIONS TODAY ON BOTH SIDES.

05:22:06.540 --> 05:22:07.441
CLEARLY, THERE'S A LOT OF

05:22:07.508 --> 05:22:08.442
EMOTIONS WITH THE FEDERAL

05:22:08.509 --> 05:22:10.077
GOVERNMENT ON HOW PEOPLE FEEL

05:22:10.144 --> 05:22:12.813
ABOUT THAT. NOT A SINGLE ONE OF

05:22:12.880 --> 05:22:14.081
US HAVE SAID WHAT TEXAS IS

05:22:14.148 --> 05:22:16.383
DOING IS GOOD. WHAT CALIFORNIA

05:22:16.450 --> 05:22:18.752
IS ABOUT TO DO IS GOOD, BUT

05:22:18.819 --> 05:22:22.256
IT'S BECAUSE OF EMOTIONS AND

05:22:22.322 --> 05:22:24.124
BECAUSE OF THAT EMOTION. WE

05:22:24.191 --> 05:22:27.027
HAVE POLICY. AND IF YOU DO

05:22:27.094 --> 05:22:28.128
POLICY THAT IS EMOTIONAL, IT

05:22:28.195 --> 05:22:30.230
USUALLY TURNS OUT BAD AND ONE

05:22:30.297 --> 05:22:33.434
WAY OR THE OTHER. SO I RISE ON

05:22:33.500 --> 05:22:36.704
BEHALF OF A COMMUNITY 33 MILES

05:22:36.770 --> 05:22:39.406
SOUTH OF HERE, COMMUNITY OF

05:22:39.473 --> 05:22:41.075
JUST UNDER 69,000 PEOPLE CALLED

05:22:41.141 --> 05:22:47.114
LODI. LODI IS SPLIT INTO THREE

05:22:47.181 --> 05:22:48.348
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. ALMOST

05:22:48.415 --> 05:22:51.051
IN THE CENTER OF TOWN, A

05:22:51.118 --> 05:22:53.587
COMMUNITY THAT IS BY AND LARGE

05:22:53.654 --> 05:22:55.022
FAMILY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR

05:22:55.089 --> 05:22:57.624
GENERATIONS. A FARMING

05:22:57.691 --> 05:22:59.593
COMMUNITY, WE HAVE NOW SPLIT

05:22:59.660 --> 05:23:02.629
THAT. PARENTS VOTING

05:23:02.696 --> 05:23:05.466
DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR KIDS,

05:23:05.532 --> 05:23:06.500
THAN THEIR GRANDPARENTS

05:23:06.567 --> 05:23:08.435
COLLEAGUES. WHEN WE DO THINGS

05:23:08.502 --> 05:23:10.204
THAT ARE EMOTIONAL, WE GET BAD

05:23:10.270 --> 05:23:12.072
POLICY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

05:23:12.139 --> 05:23:13.507
KEEPING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER,

05:23:13.574 --> 05:23:16.276
SPLITTING THE COMMUNITY OF

05:23:16.343 --> 05:23:18.145
68,000 PEOPLE IS SIMPLY WRONG.

05:23:18.212 --> 05:23:20.280
AND MY HEART TRULY GOES OUT TO

05:23:20.347 --> 05:23:21.281
LODI. AND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER

05:23:21.348 --> 05:23:23.484
EXAMPLES THAT HAVE BEEN STATED,

05:23:23.550 --> 05:23:25.285
BUT THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED. IT

05:23:25.352 --> 05:23:27.387
TRULY, TRULY DOES. WE NEED TO

05:23:27.454 --> 05:23:28.388
TAKE THE EMOTION OUT OF POLICY

05:23:28.455 --> 05:23:30.758
SO WE CAN CREATE GOOD POLICY

05:23:30.824 --> 05:23:32.025
AND WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU.

05:23:32.092 --> 05:23:34.495
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO

05:23:34.561 --> 05:23:37.064
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

05:23:37.131 --> 05:23:38.132
MEMBER FLORES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:23:38.198 --> 05:23:42.803
PATTERSON, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

05:23:42.870 --> 05:23:46.039
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I

05:23:46.106 --> 05:23:48.008
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY

05:23:48.075 --> 05:23:52.846
TODAY. YOU KNOW, THESE THESE

05:23:52.913 --> 05:23:54.148
MAPS. I'M GOING TO ANSWER A

05:23:54.214 --> 05:23:56.250
QUESTION FOR ONE OF MY

05:23:56.316 --> 05:23:57.117
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

05:23:57.184 --> 05:23:59.486
THE AISLE. THE WORST KEPT

05:23:59.553 --> 05:24:01.355
SECRET IN SACRAMENTO HISTORY.

05:24:01.421 --> 05:24:02.322
THERE AREN'T VERY MANY SECRETS

05:24:02.389 --> 05:24:04.892
IN THIS PLACE. THIS IS

05:24:04.958 --> 05:24:08.061
DEFINITELY NOT ONE. I WAS

05:24:08.128 --> 05:24:10.364
LOOKING AT AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN

05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:13.433
TWO MEMBERS OF OUR PRESS CORPS,

05:24:13.500 --> 05:24:17.838
WHERE ONE MEMBER KEPT ASKING.

05:24:17.905 --> 05:24:21.208
ELECTED OFFICIALS BECAUSE, YOU

05:24:21.275 --> 05:24:23.210
KNOW, MAYBE ELECTED OFFICIALS

05:24:23.277 --> 05:24:24.144
ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, LIKE,

05:24:24.211 --> 05:24:27.181
WHO DREW THESE MAPS? WHO? AND,

05:24:27.247 --> 05:24:28.949
YOU KNOW, THAT QUESTION WAS

05:24:29.016 --> 05:24:30.284
KIND OF ASKED A LOT BECAUSE,

05:24:30.350 --> 05:24:32.119
YOU KNOW, IT'S AN IMPORTANT

05:24:32.186 --> 05:24:33.987
QUESTION. AND ANOTHER MEMBER OF

05:24:34.054 --> 05:24:36.190
THE PRESS CORPS SAID, OH, COME

05:24:36.256 --> 05:24:39.626
ON, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DREW

05:24:39.693 --> 05:24:41.461
THE MAPS. ACTUALLY, THEY WERE

05:24:41.528 --> 05:24:43.163
JUST ON A PODCAST SAYING THEY

05:24:43.230 --> 05:24:46.066
DREW THE MAPS. SO THE WORST

05:24:46.133 --> 05:24:51.138
KEPT SECRET IN AMERICA IS THAT

05:24:51.205 --> 05:24:54.241
DEMOCRATIC CONSULTANT PAUL

05:24:54.308 --> 05:24:57.544
MITCHELL DREW THESE MAPS AND

05:24:57.611 --> 05:25:01.415
TOLD YOU ALL TO ADOPT IT. AND

05:25:01.481 --> 05:25:03.550
SO THERE'S NO SECRET WE ALL

05:25:03.617 --> 05:25:05.919
KNEW THAT. WE ALL KNOW THAT.

05:25:05.986 --> 05:25:09.122
BUT BUT I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S

05:25:09.189 --> 05:25:12.192
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT

05:25:12.259 --> 05:25:15.362

05:25:15.429 --> 05:25:16.463
IS THAT ONE OF THE PRESENTERS

05:25:16.530 --> 05:25:21.568

05:25:26.373 --> 05:25:28.809

MENTIONED IN COMMITTEE SAID

05:25:33.146 --> 05:25:35.616
SPECIFICALLY, THESE ARE

05:25:35.682 --> 05:25:40.254
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERED MAPS.

05:25:40.320 --> 05:25:42.122
THAT IS WHAT WAS SAID IN

05:25:42.189 --> 05:25:43.891
COMMITTEE BY OUR CO PRESENTER.

05:25:43.957 --> 05:25:46.126
AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW

05:25:46.193 --> 05:25:48.028
IF THAT'S YOUR FEELING AS WELL

05:25:48.095 --> 05:25:50.230
WITH THAT. ALSO, I RESPECTFULLY

05:25:50.297 --> 05:25:52.232
ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU.

05:25:52.299 --> 05:25:54.034
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON,

KNOW, I DON'T NEED THE

05:26:05.913 --> 05:26:06.380
GOVERNOR'S PRESS OFFICE TO

05:26:06.446 --> 05:26:09.383
WRITE MY SPEECHES LIKE THE

05:26:09.449 --> 05:26:12.386
SPEAKER DOES. AND JUST A MOMENT,

05:26:12.452 --> 05:26:15.522
MR. GALLAGHER, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:26:15.589 --> 05:26:24.965
BERMAN, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. I

05:26:25.032 --> 05:26:31.138
WANT TO ASK. IN HIS OWN WORDS.

05:26:31.204 --> 05:26:33.807
DEFINITELY NOT THE GENTLEMAN,

05:26:33.874 --> 05:26:35.375
NOT THE GENTLEMAN. THE PERSON

05:26:35.442 --> 05:26:38.378
FROM NICHOLAS. NOT TO INSULT

05:26:38.445 --> 05:26:42.549
PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR AND TO KEEP

05:26:42.616 --> 05:26:44.584
HIS COMMENTS TO THE BILL THAT

05:26:44.651 --> 05:26:45.919
WE'RE DEBATING. THANK YOU.

05:26:45.986 --> 05:26:47.387
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN, YOUR

05:26:47.454 --> 05:26:48.155
POINT IS WELL TAKEN. LEADER

05:26:48.221 --> 05:26:50.223
GALLAGHER, PLEASE DO NOT IMPUGN

05:26:50.290 --> 05:26:51.959
PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL, BE

05:26:52.025 --> 05:26:54.328
DECOROUS, FOLLOW THE RULES OF

05:26:54.394 --> 05:26:56.330
DEBATE. AS ALWAYS, I ONLY SPEAK

05:26:56.396 --> 05:27:00.968
THE TRUTH AND I CAN DO NO OTHER.

05:27:01.034 --> 05:27:03.203
MR. SPEAKER. AND YOU KNOW, AND

05:27:03.270 --> 05:27:04.871
APPARENTLY, THE MAJORITY

05:27:04.938 --> 05:27:06.073
LEADER'S SPEECH WAS WRITTEN

05:27:06.139 --> 05:27:09.309
YESTERDAY BECAUSE SHE READ

05:27:09.376 --> 05:27:10.577
THOSE REMARKS AND YOU WERE OUT

05:27:10.644 --> 05:27:12.145
OF ORDER. MR. GALLAGHER, THIS

05:27:12.212 --> 05:27:13.981
IS THE LAST WARNING. IF YOU

05:27:14.047 --> 05:27:16.083
DON'T ABIDE BY THE RULES OF

05:27:16.149 --> 05:27:17.284
THIS HOUSE, WE WILL MOVE ON. IN

05:27:17.351 --> 05:27:19.519
HER REMARKS, SHE SAYS THAT THIS

05:27:19.586 --> 05:27:21.054
IS ONLY IF TEXAS MOVES FORWARD.

05:27:21.121 --> 05:27:22.289
AND WE ALL KNOW FROM THE

05:27:22.356 --> 05:27:23.457
AMENDMENT THIS MORNING THAT

05:27:23.523 --> 05:27:25.158
TEXAS IS NOT A CONDITION OF

05:27:25.225 --> 05:27:26.326
MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS

05:27:26.393 --> 05:27:28.829
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDER. BUT LET'S

05:27:28.895 --> 05:27:31.298
JUST TALK ACTUALLY ABOUT YOU

05:27:31.365 --> 05:27:33.033
GUYS SAYING FIGHTING FIRE WITH

05:27:33.100 --> 05:27:35.469
FIRE, LIKE WHAT IS ACTUALLY

05:27:35.535 --> 05:27:37.270
HAPPENING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,

05:27:37.337 --> 05:27:39.206
ACTUALLY TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA

05:27:39.272 --> 05:27:41.375
ARE VERY SIMILAR. THE MINORITY

05:27:41.441 --> 05:27:43.210
PARTY IN BOTH STATES GETS ABOUT

05:27:43.276 --> 05:27:45.712
40% OF THE VOTE. DEMOCRATS GET

05:27:45.779 --> 05:27:48.148
ABOUT 40% IN TEXAS. HERE IN

05:27:48.215 --> 05:27:50.484
CALIFORNIA, WE GET AROUND 40%

05:27:50.550 --> 05:27:52.252
HERE. YOU KNOW, ON STATEWIDE

05:27:52.319 --> 05:27:56.723
VOTES. BUT RIGHT NOW, TEXAS IS

05:27:56.790 --> 05:27:57.591
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION IS

05:27:57.657 --> 05:28:01.028
MADE UP OF 30% DEMOCRATS. RIGHT.

05:28:01.094 --> 05:28:03.296
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS HERE IN

05:28:03.363 --> 05:28:08.969
CALIFORNIA? 17%. SO ALREADY

05:28:09.036 --> 05:28:12.272
DISPARITY. AND EVEN IF TEXAS

05:28:12.339 --> 05:28:15.075
DOES MOVE FORWARD, THEY WOULD

05:28:15.142 --> 05:28:17.544
BE IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL IN

05:28:17.611 --> 05:28:18.145
GETTING FIVE SEATS IN TEXAS,

05:28:18.211 --> 05:28:20.414
THEY'D ACTUALLY STILL BE BETTER

05:28:20.480 --> 05:28:22.049
THAN US IN REPRESENTATION

05:28:22.115 --> 05:28:24.051
BECAUSE 18% OF THE DELEGATION

05:28:24.117 --> 05:28:25.519
WOULD BE DEMOCRATS. AND

05:28:25.585 --> 05:28:26.920
MEANWHILE, HERE AT 17, AND WHAT

05:28:26.987 --> 05:28:29.089
YOU GUYS ARE DOING WITH THESE

05:28:29.156 --> 05:28:32.592
MAPS IS TAKING US DOWN TO 7%.

05:28:32.659 --> 05:28:34.094
THAT'S FAIR. THAT'S

05:28:34.161 --> 05:28:37.030
REPRESENTATION. THAT'S FIRE

05:28:37.097 --> 05:28:39.800
WITH FIRE. SEEMS LIKE A

05:28:39.866 --> 05:28:42.035
SLEDGEHAMMER. AND MORE

05:28:42.102 --> 05:28:43.103
IMPORTANTLY, IT'S NOT ABOUT

05:28:43.170 --> 05:28:45.505
PARTY. IT'S ABOUT TAKING AWAY

05:28:45.572 --> 05:28:46.073
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS OF

05:28:46.139 --> 05:28:49.176
REPRESENTATION. PLACES. PLACES

05:28:49.242 --> 05:28:50.977
THAT HAVE MEANING, THAT HAVE

05:28:51.044 --> 05:28:53.447
VALUES, THAT HAVE CERTAIN VIEWS

05:28:53.513 --> 05:28:55.048
ON THEY SHARE INDUSTRIES. AND

05:28:55.115 --> 05:28:59.686
YOU CAN'T SIT HERE AND TELL ME

05:28:59.753 --> 05:29:02.923
THAT A MAP FOR ALL OF US TO SEE,

05:29:02.989 --> 05:29:06.760
FROM MODOC TO MARIN COUNTY IS

05:29:06.827 --> 05:29:10.130
FAIR REPRESENTATION, THAT THAT

05:29:10.197 --> 05:29:12.866
MEETS THE CONSTITUTIONAL

05:29:12.933 --> 05:29:14.334
PRINCIPLES OF COMPACTNESS THAT

05:29:14.401 --> 05:29:18.105
ARE IN OUR ARTICLE 21 OF THE

05:29:18.171 --> 05:29:20.874
CONSTITUTION. THIS SPECIFICALLY

05:29:20.941 --> 05:29:22.275
SAYS DISTRICTS SHALL NOT BE

05:29:22.342 --> 05:29:24.177
DRAWN TO ENCOURAGE GEOGRAPHIC,

05:29:24.244 --> 05:29:25.946
THAT THEY SHALL BE DRAWN TO

05:29:26.012 --> 05:29:27.614
ENCOURAGE GEOGRAPHICAL

05:29:27.681 --> 05:29:28.882
COMPACTNESS, SUCH THAT NEARBY

05:29:28.949 --> 05:29:31.051
AREAS OF POPULATION ARE NOT

05:29:31.118 --> 05:29:33.153
BYPASSED FOR MORE DISTANT

05:29:33.220 --> 05:29:34.087
POPULATION. AND THAT'S EXACTLY

05:29:34.154 --> 05:29:36.189
WHAT THAT MAP DOES. AND YOU

05:29:36.256 --> 05:29:39.526
KNOW IT. AND THE MAJORITY

05:29:39.593 --> 05:29:41.695
LEADER KNOWS THIS BECAUSE WE

05:29:41.761 --> 05:29:43.163
BOTH REPRESENT DISTRICTS. AND I

05:29:43.230 --> 05:29:45.132
THINK WE DO IT PRETTY WELL. WE

05:29:45.198 --> 05:29:47.267
STAND UP FOR OUR PEOPLE. WE

05:29:47.334 --> 05:29:49.336
FIGHT FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE

05:29:49.402 --> 05:29:51.138
IN THEIR INTERESTS. WE

05:29:51.204 --> 05:29:52.372
REPRESENT THEM WELL. AND IN

05:29:52.439 --> 05:29:54.141
CONGRESS. I HAVE A

05:29:54.207 --> 05:29:55.342
REPRESENTATIVE, DOUG LAMALFA,

05:29:55.408 --> 05:29:57.944
WHO DOES THAT. AND YOU HAVE ONE,

05:29:58.011 --> 05:30:00.447
MR. MIKE THOMPSON, WHO DOES THE

05:30:00.514 --> 05:30:01.915
SAME THING. AND THOSE

05:30:01.982 --> 05:30:03.116
CONGRESSMEN ACTUALLY WORK

05:30:03.183 --> 05:30:06.319
TOGETHER ON A LOT OF ISSUES, ON

05:30:06.386 --> 05:30:07.521
WATER ISSUES. AND THAT

05:30:07.587 --> 05:30:10.023
BIPARTISAN FASHION ACTUALLY IS

05:30:10.090 --> 05:30:11.258
VERY HELPFUL WHEN

05:30:11.324 --> 05:30:13.293
ADMINISTRATIONS CHANGE. BUT

05:30:13.360 --> 05:30:15.195
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IS

05:30:15.262 --> 05:30:19.199
BLOW THAT ALL UP. AND CREATE A

05:30:19.266 --> 05:30:22.169
ONE PARTY SYSTEM. AND HERE'S

05:30:22.235 --> 05:30:24.137
THE OTHER THING. WHO GETS TO

05:30:24.204 --> 05:30:25.238
DECIDE WHO GETS REPRESENTED?

05:30:25.305 --> 05:30:27.941
NOT THE PEOPLE, THE PARTIES AND

05:30:28.008 --> 05:30:30.243
THE PARTY INSIDERS AND THE

05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:31.044
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE FAVORED

05:30:31.111 --> 05:30:34.281
INSIDE TRACK. AND I'M ONLY

05:30:34.347 --> 05:30:36.016
SAYING WHAT'S BEEN REPORTED IS

05:30:36.082 --> 05:30:38.318
THAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

05:30:38.385 --> 05:30:40.253
POLITICIANS IN THIS LEGISLATURE,

05:30:40.320 --> 05:30:42.455
THE PRO TEM IS REPORTED TO HAVE

05:30:42.522 --> 05:30:44.191
BEEN INVOLVED IN DRAWING A

05:30:44.257 --> 05:30:46.092
DISTRICT THAT FAVORS HIM THAT

05:30:46.159 --> 05:30:49.129
HE PLANS TO RUN IN. I DON'T

05:30:49.196 --> 05:30:51.431
KNOW IF THAT'S A FACT, BUT IT

05:30:51.498 --> 05:30:54.601
HAS BEEN REPORTED, AND I THINK

05:30:54.668 --> 05:30:56.469
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM, THAT THE

05:30:56.536 --> 05:30:58.438
PEOPLE DON'T GET TO CHOOSE WHO

05:30:58.505 --> 05:30:59.539
THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS. BUT

05:30:59.606 --> 05:31:02.442
THE PARTY INSIDERS DO. AND THAT

05:31:02.509 --> 05:31:05.579
IS THE REAL ISSUE HERE. AND

05:31:05.645 --> 05:31:06.179
GUYS, I'M JUST GOING TO END ON

05:31:06.246 --> 05:31:08.515
THIS BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT

05:31:08.582 --> 05:31:10.450
YOU DON'T STAND UP TO THIS

05:31:10.517 --> 05:31:12.252
GOVERNOR. YOU NEVER HAVE. AND

05:31:12.319 --> 05:31:14.154
HE IS DOING WRONG THINGS AND HE

05:31:14.221 --> 05:31:16.156
IS PUSHING YOU AND HE INSULTS

05:31:16.223 --> 05:31:18.124
YOU ALL THE TIME AND SAYS HE

05:31:18.191 --> 05:31:19.159
JAMS YOU AND THIS IS WHAT HE'S

05:31:19.226 --> 05:31:21.561
GOT TO DO, AND HE'S GOING TO

05:31:21.628 --> 05:31:22.929
PUSH IT THROUGH. AND FOR ALL

05:31:22.996 --> 05:31:24.564
THIS TALK, MAN, THAT I'VE HEARD

05:31:24.631 --> 05:31:26.099
ON THIS FLOOR TODAY, I JUST

05:31:26.166 --> 05:31:27.400
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THANK YOU,

05:31:27.467 --> 05:31:28.034
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER. WELL,

05:31:28.101 --> 05:31:29.970

MEMBER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU,

05:31:35.575 --> 05:31:38.311
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER,

05:31:38.378 --> 05:31:40.413
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELLIS, YOU ARE

05:31:40.480 --> 05:31:42.916
RECOGNIZED. I'D LIKE TO KNOW

05:31:42.983 --> 05:31:48.755
WHO DREW THE MAPS. I DO TO

05:31:48.822 --> 05:31:51.992
STAND. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

05:31:52.058 --> 05:31:57.063
MEMBER ELLIS. SOMEBODY. MEMBER

05:31:57.130 --> 05:31:59.299
DAVIS, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON

05:31:59.366 --> 05:32:02.302
BEHALF OF 500,000 CALIFORNIANS.

05:32:02.369 --> 05:32:04.137
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO DO THE

05:32:04.204 --> 05:32:07.240
MAPS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

05:32:07.307 --> 05:32:09.075

05:32:09.142 --> 05:32:12.312
DIXON. I TOO, ON ASSEMBLY, ON

05:32:12.379 --> 05:32:15.682
BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 72,

05:32:15.749 --> 05:32:17.550
500,000 CALIFORNIANS WHO DREW

05:32:17.617 --> 05:32:20.287
THE MAPS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

05:32:20.353 --> 05:32:23.123
MEMBER DIXON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:32:23.189 --> 05:32:25.058
MARK GONZALEZ, YOU ARE

05:32:25.125 --> 05:32:26.926
RECOGNIZED. LET'S BE CLEAR,

05:32:26.993 --> 05:32:28.662
MEMBERS, I WRITE MY OWN TALKING

05:32:28.728 --> 05:32:30.230
POINTS. SO LET'S START WITH

05:32:30.297 --> 05:32:32.065
THAT. AND LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR

05:32:32.132 --> 05:32:34.567
THAT THE MAPS DIDN'T JUST COME

05:32:34.634 --> 05:32:35.435
OUT OF THIN AIR. THEY WERE

05:32:35.502 --> 05:32:36.736
DRAWN THROUGH CALIFORNIA'S

05:32:36.803 --> 05:32:38.204
PROCESS WITH EXPERTS AND

05:32:38.271 --> 05:32:40.940
COMMUNITY INPUT YEARS AGO.

05:32:41.007 --> 05:32:42.475
DON'T ACT BRAND NEW. WHAT

05:32:42.542 --> 05:32:44.177
FRUSTRATES ME IS THAT PEOPLE

05:32:44.244 --> 05:32:46.079
KEEP OBSESSING OVER WHO HELD

05:32:46.146 --> 05:32:48.281
THE PEN, INSTEAD OF WHY THESE

05:32:48.348 --> 05:32:49.149
MAPS EVEN MATTER IN THE FIRST

05:32:49.215 --> 05:32:52.152
PLACE. THIS ISN'T A SCOOBY DOO

05:32:52.218 --> 05:32:53.386
MYSTERY. THERE'S NO MAPS TO RIP

05:32:53.453 --> 05:32:55.121
OFF, NO HIDDEN VILLAIN. THE

05:32:55.188 --> 05:32:57.357
PROCESS WAS OPEN, TRANSPARENT,

05:32:57.424 --> 05:33:00.126
AND ACCOUNTABLE FROM DAY ONE.

05:33:00.193 --> 05:33:01.361
AND LET'S BE HONEST, THE

05:33:01.428 --> 05:33:03.096
HYPOCRISY IS GLARING. REPORTERS

05:33:03.163 --> 05:33:05.198
AREN'T GRILLING REPUBLICANS IN

05:33:05.265 --> 05:33:06.900
TEXAS ABOUT WHO'S DRAWING THEIR

05:33:06.966 --> 05:33:08.368
MAPS, EVEN THOUGH THOSE MAPS

05:33:08.435 --> 05:33:09.836
ARE BLATANT GERRYMANDERING

05:33:09.903 --> 05:33:11.104
DESIGNED TO SILENCE VOTERS AND

05:33:11.171 --> 05:33:13.206
LOCK IN POWER. I DON'T HEAR

05:33:13.273 --> 05:33:15.208
ANYBODY ON THE RIGHT SIDE

05:33:15.275 --> 05:33:16.209
SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW

05:33:16.276 --> 05:33:19.179
THAT THEY'RE WRONG. BUT HERE IN

05:33:19.245 --> 05:33:20.313
CALIFORNIA, WE FOLLOW THE RULES

05:33:20.380 --> 05:33:23.149
AND DID IT RIGHT. SUDDENLY IT'S

05:33:23.216 --> 05:33:25.285
TREATED LIKE A SCANDAL.

05:33:25.352 --> 05:33:27.187
MEANWHILE, REPUBLICANS IN TEXAS,

05:33:27.253 --> 05:33:29.222
FLORIDA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY

05:33:29.289 --> 05:33:30.056
ARE ACTIVELY RIGGING DISTRICTS

05:33:30.123 --> 05:33:33.626
TO SILENCE VOTERS AND PROTECT

05:33:33.693 --> 05:33:35.662
DONALD TRUMP. YOUR HERO,

05:33:35.729 --> 05:33:37.330
CALIFORNIA IS NOT GOING TO SIT

05:33:37.397 --> 05:33:39.232
BACK AND LET THEM CHEAT THEIR

05:33:39.299 --> 05:33:41.301
WAY INTO POWER. THESE MAPS ARE

05:33:41.368 --> 05:33:43.036
ABOUT PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY

05:33:43.103 --> 05:33:45.705
AND MAKING SURE EVERY COMMUNITY

05:33:45.772 --> 05:33:51.277
HERE HAS A FAIR VOICE. PERIOD.

05:33:51.344 --> 05:33:53.279
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

05:33:53.346 --> 05:33:56.249

OF ORDER. THIS, MR. SPEAKER, IS

05:34:01.554 --> 05:34:03.022
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THINGS

05:34:03.089 --> 05:34:05.191
THAT MISSTATE THE FACTS IN THE

05:34:05.258 --> 05:34:06.426
RECORD THROUGH OUR COMMITTEE

05:34:06.493 --> 05:34:08.261
PROCESS AND AND WHAT WE KNOW

TODAY ON THE FLOOR. ONE IS THAT

05:34:10.130 --> 05:34:12.065
THE ELECTION? EXCUSE ME, MR.

05:34:12.132 --> 05:34:13.633
GALLAGHER, WHAT IS THE RULE

05:34:13.700 --> 05:34:15.001
THAT HAS BEEN VIOLATED? STATE

05:34:15.068 --> 05:34:16.536
YOUR POINT OF ORDER, MISSTATES

05:34:16.603 --> 05:34:18.171
THE TESTIMONY AND THE RECORD.

05:34:18.238 --> 05:34:20.273
YOUR POINT IS NOT WELL TAKEN.

05:34:20.340 --> 05:34:22.175
OKAY. MEMBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:34:22.242 --> 05:34:24.210

THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND I'M

05:34:26.179 --> 05:34:27.914
SITTING HERE AND HEARING THE

05:34:27.981 --> 05:34:30.083
DIFFERENT DEBATES GOING ON FROM

05:34:30.150 --> 05:34:31.317
COLLEAGUES FROM BOTH SIDES OF

05:34:31.384 --> 05:34:33.420
THE AISLE. BUT I HAVE TO RAISE

05:34:33.486 --> 05:34:36.122
MY MIC AND BE ABLE TO TALK

05:34:36.189 --> 05:34:38.057
ABOUT WHEN A COLLEAGUE FROM THE

05:34:38.124 --> 05:34:40.226
OTHER SIDE IS TALKING ABOUT

05:34:40.293 --> 05:34:42.295
HISTORY, TALKING ABOUT

05:34:42.362 --> 05:34:44.464
CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE, AND

05:34:44.531 --> 05:34:46.166
DRAWING THEM INTO THIS

05:34:46.232 --> 05:34:48.535
CONVERSATION. WHERE WAS THAT

05:34:48.601 --> 05:34:50.937
VOICE? WHERE WAS THAT VOICE

05:34:51.004 --> 05:34:53.139
WHEN THIS STATE WAS TAKEN FROM

05:34:53.206 --> 05:34:55.942
THEM? WHERE WAS THAT VOICE WHEN

05:34:56.009 --> 05:34:57.110
THEIR REPRESENTATION ISN'T

05:34:57.177 --> 05:34:59.279
THERE? WHERE WAS THAT VOICE

05:34:59.345 --> 05:35:00.914
WHEN THEY WERE BEING MURDERED

05:35:00.980 --> 05:35:03.817
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? AND

05:35:03.883 --> 05:35:05.652
NOW YOU WANT TO BRING THEM INTO

05:35:05.718 --> 05:35:06.820
THIS DEBATE BECAUSE IT BENEFITS

05:35:06.886 --> 05:35:08.988
YOU. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE

05:35:09.055 --> 05:35:11.157
HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND LOOK

05:35:11.224 --> 05:35:13.293
AT. BUT WHEN YOU START TO

05:35:13.359 --> 05:35:14.227
EXPLOIT THE HISTORY IN THE

05:35:14.294 --> 05:35:16.496
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR

05:35:16.563 --> 05:35:18.832
YOUR OWN GAIN IS THE SAME

05:35:18.898 --> 05:35:20.266
TACTICS THAT WERE USED WHEN

05:35:20.333 --> 05:35:22.302
THIS LAND WAS STOLEN AND

05:35:22.368 --> 05:35:25.705
MURDERED PEOPLE OF OUR CULTURE

05:35:25.772 --> 05:35:27.407
TO GET IT. I WOULD RATHER YOU

05:35:27.474 --> 05:35:29.242
STAND UP FOR ALL OF THOSE

05:35:29.309 --> 05:35:31.177
THINGS, ALL THOSE BAD THINGS,

05:35:31.244 --> 05:35:33.346
THAN TO BRING THEM IN TO

05:35:33.413 --> 05:35:35.381
JUSTIFY YOUR YOUR SEEING WHAT'S

05:35:35.448 --> 05:35:38.084
GOING ON HERE. YOU SHOULD NOT

05:35:38.151 --> 05:35:40.920
AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF

05:35:40.987 --> 05:35:43.122
YOURSELF TO BRING IN THE

05:35:43.189 --> 05:35:45.758
HISTORY, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW IN

05:35:45.825 --> 05:35:47.627
THESE CHAMBERS THE ATROCITY,

05:35:47.694 --> 05:35:49.028
THE GENOCIDE, THE BLOODS THAT

05:35:49.095 --> 05:35:51.464
SHED AND THE BONES THAT ARE

05:35:51.531 --> 05:35:53.066
STILL IN THE ARCHIVES OF MANY

05:35:53.132 --> 05:35:55.101
INSTITUTIONS IN THIS STATE, WHO

05:35:55.168 --> 05:35:57.937
STILL CALL OUR REMAINS OF OUR

05:35:58.004 --> 05:36:00.206
ANCESTORS TROPHIES IN THEIR

05:36:00.273 --> 05:36:01.241
BACKYARD. IT'S TIME THAT WE

05:36:01.307 --> 05:36:03.009
COME TOGETHER. AND IF YOU WANT

05:36:03.076 --> 05:36:04.210
TO BRING THINGS FORWARD FOR

05:36:04.277 --> 05:36:06.246
YOUR OWN GAIN, THIS BODY WILL

05:36:06.312 --> 05:36:08.481
NOT STAND FOR IT. IT'S TIME

05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:10.216
THAT WE STAND FOR THE VOICES OF

05:36:10.283 --> 05:36:13.052
ALL CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE,

05:36:13.119 --> 05:36:14.254
AND STAND UP WHEN THEY ARE

05:36:14.320 --> 05:36:15.855
BROUGHT INTO THESE THESE

05:36:15.922 --> 05:36:18.191
DEBATES FOR YOUR OWN GAIN.

05:36:18.258 --> 05:36:21.027
THAT'S THE SAME TACTIC THAT WAS

05:36:21.094 --> 05:36:23.029
USED IN COLONIZATION. AND MR.

SPEAKER, I CALLED THE MEMBER

05:36:25.164 --> 05:36:27.300
OUT. I CALLED THE MEMBER OUT

05:36:27.367 --> 05:36:29.969
FOR USING OUR PEOPLE FOR SELF

05:36:30.036 --> 05:36:32.338
GAIN. THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT DOWN

05:36:32.405 --> 05:36:35.041
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S

05:36:35.108 --> 05:36:37.176
WHAT THE HISTORY IS, WHAT WE'RE

05:36:37.243 --> 05:36:39.078
STILL FIGHTING FOR IN THE STATE

05:36:39.145 --> 05:36:40.213

05:36:40.280 --> 05:36:42.682
BRINGS UP LINES AND LAND THAT

05:36:42.749 --> 05:36:45.018
HAS BEEN DRAWN, DRAWN ON STOLEN

05:36:45.084 --> 05:36:47.153
LAND, COME ON, HE SHOULD BE

05:36:47.220 --> 05:36:49.022
REPRIMANDED FOR EVEN BRINGING

THOSE THINGS FORWARD TO THIS

05:36:50.290 --> 05:36:53.092
FLOOR. IT'S TIME THAT WE STAND

05:36:53.159 --> 05:36:55.261
IN ONE UNIFIED VOICE. AND WHEN

05:36:55.328 --> 05:36:56.996
WE TALK ABOUT DEBATE, LET'S

05:36:57.063 --> 05:36:59.465
HAVE IT. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO

05:36:59.532 --> 05:37:01.935
BACK INTO HISTORY AND START TO

05:37:02.001 --> 05:37:04.137
LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND

ORDER. MR. GALLAGHER. THE POINT

05:40:18.264 --> 05:40:20.967
OF ORDER IS THAT THE BILL SAYS

05:40:21.033 --> 05:40:23.436
THAT THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE

05:40:23.503 --> 05:40:26.072
DREW THE MAPS, AND THAT IS

05:40:26.139 --> 05:40:27.140
FACTUALLY INCORRECT BASED ON

LESSON ON WHAT A POINT OF ORDER

05:40:37.250 --> 05:40:38.951
IS. WHEN YOU RAISE YOUR

05:40:39.018 --> 05:40:40.253
MICROPHONE FOR A POINT OF ORDER,

05:40:40.319 --> 05:40:42.555
YOU NEED TO STATE THE RULE

05:40:42.622 --> 05:40:43.089
THAT'S BEING VIOLATED. AND

WE'RE SPEAKING OF THE HOUSE

05:40:45.091 --> 05:40:46.959
RULES. THAT IS THE POINT OF

05:40:47.026 --> 05:40:49.729
ORDER THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE.

05:40:49.796 --> 05:40:50.630
MR. GALLAGHER. I'M GOING TO

RECOGNIZE YOU AGAIN. THE POINT

05:40:55.067 --> 05:40:57.637
OF ORDER IS THAT FACTUALLY

TRANSPARENT THAN ANY OTHER

REPUBLICAN CHALLENGES IN 2011.

05:44:49.235 --> 05:44:52.505
THOSE CHALLENGES DID NOT GIVE

05:44:52.571 --> 05:44:55.007
VOTERS A CHANCE TO DECIDE. AND

05:44:55.074 --> 05:44:57.977

REPUBLICANS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE

05:45:10.689 --> 05:45:12.024
SO AFRAID TO LET THE VOTERS

05:45:12.091 --> 05:45:14.960
HAVE A SAY. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE

05:45:15.027 --> 05:45:17.663
THEY KNOW WHY THIS PRESIDENT IN
