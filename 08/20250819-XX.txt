GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. I

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:46.749

00:59:46.816 --> 00:59:49.118
CRAZY WEEK. WILL BE SO FOR THE

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.021
APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE HERE.

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:53.156
WELCOME TO THE MEMBERS WHO WILL

JOIN US TODAY. MY CO-CHAIR HERE.

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:56.926
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:58.428
IMPORTANT. WHILE WE DO RECOGNIZE

00:59:58.494 --> 01:00:00.563
THERE ARE 500 SYMBOLIC FIRES

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.898
THAT WE HAVE TO BE PUTTING OUT

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.967
DURING THIS WEEK, WE NEED TO

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:05.501
REMEMBER AND CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:06.936
CONVERSATION ON THE ONGOING

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.705
IMPACTS TO OUR HEALTH CARE

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.506
SYSTEM. THE CONSUMERS,

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.375
CONSUMERS, AND CALIFORNIANS THAT

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.177
DEPEND ON THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:16.713
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.815
HEALTH CARE TO PROVIDERS, THAT

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.316
EVERYTHING IS EQUITABLE. SO IT

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:22.018
WAS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CAME

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.586
TOGETHER AND HEARD DIRECTLY FROM

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:26.022
THE EXPERTS ON WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:27.623
OR WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN FROM

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:30.360
THE H.R. ONE IMPACTS TO

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:32.462
CALIFORNIA. WHAT IS THE

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.597
INTERSECTION AND CORRELATION

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:37.200
BETWEEN THE RATES IN CALIFORNIA

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:39.102
AND HOW IT CORRELATES TO PUBLIC

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:41.070
HEALTH? BECAUSE IT IS A PUBLIC

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.638
HEALTH MATTER, AND WHAT

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.374
PROVIDERS ARE SEEING AS A RESULT

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.810
OF BOTH H.R. ONE AND THE RATES.

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:48.611
SO EXCITED TO BE HOSTING HERE

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.914

BUDGET COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:07.030

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.440
JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT H.R.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.008
ONE WILL HAVE PROFOUND IMPACTS

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:20.877
ON CALIFORNIA'S NET SAFETY

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.545
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS, MOST

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:24.747
SIGNIFICANTLY ON MEDI-CAL.

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.282
COLLECTIVELY, THE CUTS AND

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.984
POLICY CHANGES IN H.R. ONE IS

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.119
PROJECTED TO RESULT IN TENS OF

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.021
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT'S A B

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.556
IN REDUCED FEDERAL FUNDING OVER

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:34.690
THE NEXT DECADE, AND

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.059
SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED THE NUMBER

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.693
OF CALIFORNIANS WITH HEALTH

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.095
INSURANCE. THIS UNPRECEDENTED

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.297
FEDERAL DISINVESTMENT REPRESENTS

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.266
A STARK REVERSAL OF THE PROGRESS

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:45.234
WE HAVE MADE HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:48.404
INDEED, THIS BILL IS LEADING US

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.072
DOWN A VERY DARK PATH FOR MORE

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.673
CALIFORNIANS BEING SICKER, MORE

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.741
CALIFORNIANS WITH CRUSHING

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.476
MEDICAL DEBT, LESS FINANCIAL AND

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.878
HEALTH SECURITY, LESS CONNECTION

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:58.247
TO SCREENINGS AND PRIMARY CARE,

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.315
MORE EXPENSIVE EMERGENCY

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.818
DEPARTMENT VISITS, MORE MORAL

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.253
INJURY AND BURNOUT OF OUR

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.888
WORKFORCE, AND AN OVERALL

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.156
DIMINISHMENT OF OUR HEALTH

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:08.357
INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IS ALL

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:09.692
HAPPENING AT A TIME WHERE

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:10.893
CALIFORNIANS ARE DEMANDING

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.562
GREATER ACCESS TO BETTER CARE.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.730
THIS IS SIMPLY NO WAY TO PAPER

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.132
OVER OR CORRECT FOR THIS LEVEL

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.266
OF DISINVESTMENT IN OUR HEALTH

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.802
CARE SYSTEM AND THE EFFECTS OF

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.003
OUR ON OUR HOSPITALS, HEALTH

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.505
CARE FACILITIES AND HEALTHCARE

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.440
PROVIDERS WILL BE FELT FOR EVERY

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:26.476
SINGLE CALIFORNIAN, REGARDLESS

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.511
OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ON

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:29.512
MEDI-CAL. AT THE SAME TIME, IT

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.947
IS CLEAR THAT THIS

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:32.315
ADMINISTRATION, THIS FEDERAL

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.749
ADMINISTRATION, HAS CREATED A

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:36.285
CULTURE OF FEAR FOR IMMIGRANT

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:38.154
FAMILIES LOOKING TO MAKE HOME A

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:40.089
HOME OUT OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:41.791
CLEAR THAT NOT EVEN A DOCTOR'S

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.793
OFFICE CAN BE ASSUMED TO BE A

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.027
SAFE SPACE, AND FEDERAL ACTIONS

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:45.761
HAVE DISCOURAGED IMMIGRANT

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.130
COMMUNITIES FROM SEEKING NEEDED

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.898
CARE. WE KNOW THAT LOSING

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:50.299
COVERAGE DOESN'T MEAN PEOPLE

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:51.501
STOP GETTING SICK OR NEEDING

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.002
HEALTH CARE. IT WILL JUST

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.303
FURTHER STRESS OUR HEALTH CARE

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.272
SAFETY NET. I HAVEN'T EVEN

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:57.540
MENTIONED THE PENNY WISE POUND

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.575
FOOLISH INVESTMENT IN OUR HEALTH

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:02.011
RESEARCH AND SCIENCE, THE WAR ON

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.312
VACCINES AND EVIDENCE BASED

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:06.883
MEDICINE, THE DISSEMINATION OR

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:09.051
THE DECREASE OF DECIMATION OF

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.053
FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT SAFEGUARD

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.989
OUR HEALTH AND MORE. THE

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.690
RAMIFICATIONS ARE PROFOUND. AND

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:16.459
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE FULL

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:17.960
INFORMATION ABOUT THESE IMPACTS,

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:19.629

ABLE TO RESPOND, I'M VERY GLAD

BOTH OF OUR HOUSES, SO THAT WE

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:30.606
CAN STAND UNITED IN THE STATE OF

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.141
CALIFORNIA AND IN THIS

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.076
LEGISLATURE, IN OUR ADVOCACY FOR

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.712
CALIFORNIANS. WITH THAT, I WANT

THREE PANELS ARE DONE, WE WILL

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:02.038

PUBLIC COMMENTS THEY'D LIKE TO

ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION. SO IF

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:08.844
WE CAN GET THE PANELISTS ON H.R.

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.046

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:28.598

MEDI-CAL PROGRAM. AND IF I COULD

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:44.180
ASK FOR THE SLIDES TO BE CUED,

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:45.181
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. PERFECT.

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:46.682
THANK YOU. SO MEDI-CAL SERVES

ROUGHLY 35% OF THE STATE. THIS

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:54.223
INCLUDES OVER 5 MILLION CHILDREN

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.492
AND TEENS. IT SUPPORTS ADULTS

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.194
AND INDIVIDUALS WITH

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.295
DISABILITIES. IT'S MORE THAN

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.730
JUST HEALTH CARE. IT'S A

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:02.498
LIFELINE FOR CALIFORNIANS. IT

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.333
SERVES. H.R. ONE, AS NOTED

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.701
EARLIER, MAKES SWEEPING CHANGES

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.570
TO THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM AND WILL

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.805
CAUSE WIDESPREAD HARM BY MAKING

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:11.907
MASSIVE REDUCTIONS IN FEDERAL

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.242

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.314
CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON. THESE

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:19.815
CHANGES PUT TENS OF BILLIONS OF

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:21.450
DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDING AT

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:23.252
RISK, AND COULD RESULT IN THE

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:25.187
LOSS OF COVERAGE FOR MILLIONS OF

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:28.124
CALIFORNIANS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

COMPONENT IS THE DATE OF

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:27.803
ENACTMENT OF H.R. ONE. UNLESS

HOSPITALS CAN RECEIVE THROUGH

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:22.224
CERTAIN TYPES OF PAYMENTS. THIS

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.293
MEANS LESS FUNDING FOR BOTH

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.794

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.276
THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:15.677
ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL HEALTHCARE

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:17.112
SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. FOR

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.747
PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THE IMPACTS

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:21.049
OF H.R. ONE WERE IMMEDIATE AND

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:22.551
DEVASTATING. AS THE DIRECTOR

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.352
MENTIONED, THIS LAW FEDERALLY

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:26.221
DEFUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:28.356
OVERNIGHT. CONGRESS DID THIS BY

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:29.724
CUTTING OFF FEDERAL FUNDING TO

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:31.893
PAY FOR ANY SERVICES IN MEDICAID

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.728
PROVIDED BY A PROHIBITED ENTITY,

01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:36.231
WHICH WAS DEFINED AS A NONPROFIT

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:37.132
ORGANIZATION THAT PRIMARILY

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.800
ENGAGES IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.835
CARE, PROVIDES ABORTION, AND

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:43.939
RECEIVED MORE THAN $800,000 IN

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.207
STATE AND FEDERAL MEDICAID

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:48.043
FUNDING IN 2023. THIS NEARLY

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:49.578
EXCLUSIVELY APPLIES TO PLANNED

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:52.080
PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTERS IN

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:53.048
CALIFORNIA. THE SEVEN PLANNED

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:55.016
PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES SERVE ONE

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.685
THIRD OF ALL PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:58.887
PATIENTS NATIONWIDE. THEY ARE

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:00.388
COLLECTIVELY THE LARGEST

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:02.090
PROVIDER IN THE FAMILY PACT

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:03.758
PROGRAM AND THE LARGEST PROVIDER

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:06.127
OF ABORTION AND MEDI-CAL. IT'S

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:09.264
ABOUT 25,000 PATIENTS PER WEEK,

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:12.200
AS THE DIRECTOR SAID, OVER 80%

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:14.135
OF OUR 1 MILLION PATIENT VISITS

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:15.704
THAT THEY PROVIDE ANNUALLY ARE

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.239
REIMBURSED BY THE MEDI-CAL

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:20.508
PROGRAM. IN FACT, 1 IN 4

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:21.576
CALIFORNIANS HAS RECEIVED CARE

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.278
AT A PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.379
EVERYONE HAS A PLANNED

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.681
PARENTHOOD STORY. THIS IS WHY

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:28.316
DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:29.417
DEVASTATING. THE REST OF THE

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:30.819
STATE'S MEDI-CAL PROVIDER

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:32.654
NETWORK CANNOT MEET THE DEMAND

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:33.622
FOR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:35.290
HEALTH CARE IN THE STATE WITHOUT

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:38.426
PLANNED PARENTHOOD. H.R. ONE IS

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:39.227
CATASTROPHIC TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:41.329
ABILITY TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:43.765
AS IT STANDS TODAY, THERE IS A

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.233
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION BLOCKING

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.935
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:48.203
DEFUND. HOWEVER, THIS HAS

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.671
ALREADY BEEN APPEALED. THE

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:50.939
CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:52.807
HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:53.942
ELIMINATING PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:56.211
AND THEREFORE ACCESS TO ABORTION

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:57.912
AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS

01:21:57.979 --> 01:21:59.481
A PRIORITY THAT THEY WILL NOT

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:01.883
WALK AWAY FROM. WE KNOW THAT

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.452
RELYING ON LITIGATION IS

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:06.888
PRECARIOUS AND UNSTABLE. IT IS

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.723
LIKELY THAT THE US SUPREME COURT

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.558
COULD BE ASKED BY THE CURRENT

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.227
ADMINISTRATION TO OVERTURN THE

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.129
INJUNCTION IN A MATTER OF WEEKS.

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:16.231
THIS MEANS THAT WITHOUT STATE

01:22:16.298 --> 01:22:17.232
INTERVENTION, PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.067
HEALTH CENTERS WILL STOP GETTING

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:20.969
PAID FOR SERVING MEDI-CAL

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:22.270
PATIENTS. IF THAT HAPPENS, A

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:24.205
FULL PLANNED PARENTHOOD DEFUND

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.607
THE SEVEN CALIFORNIA PLANNED

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:26.841
PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES ANTICIPATE

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.510
THAT THEY WILL NEED TO CLOSE

01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:30.679
HEALTH CENTERS, DRASTICALLY CUT

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.814
THEIR HOURS AND DAYS OF

01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:34.215
OPERATION, REDUCE THEIR

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:36.318
WORKFORCE, AND OR SCALE BACK THE

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:38.186
SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE.

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:39.621
PATIENTS WHO RELY ON PLANNED

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:40.622
PARENTHOOD WILL HAVE MORE

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:42.857
DIFFICULTY ACCESSING SERVICES,

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:44.259
INCLUDING FAMILY PLANNING,

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:46.461
SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR STIS

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:48.863
AND CANCER SCREENINGS. IN TERMS

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.732
OF DOLLARS, THE STATE RECEIVES

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.268
ABOUT 305 MILLION IN FEDERAL

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:55.136
MATCHING FUNDS ANNUALLY TO

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:56.104
REIMBURSE PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.439
THE FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.441
THEY PROVIDE, AND THIS IS A GOOD

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:01.242
TIME FOR A REMINDER THAT NO

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:03.878
FEDERAL FUNDS CAN BE USED TO

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:06.614
REIMBURSE ABORTION SERVICES. IF

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.350
THE DEFUND PROVISION IS

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:09.884
REINSTATED, THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:11.619
WILL FACE A SHORTFALL AS A

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:13.421
RESULT OF LOST FEDERAL FUNDING,

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.657
AND THE MEDI-CAL SYSTEM RISKS

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.225
LOSING THE STATE'S KEY PROVIDER

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:18.393
OF SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.062
HEALTH CARE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:22.597
CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.232
LEGISLATURE AND STATE LEADERSHIP

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:25.734
TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS CONTINUE

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.668
TO HAVE ACCESS TO PLANNED

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.203
PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTERS AND

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:30.372
PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S

01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:31.439
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:34.476
REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. THANK YOU

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:38.313
SO MUCH. HI, ADAM DORSEY,

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:39.881
CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION

01:23:39.948 --> 01:23:41.583
WE REPRESENT ABOUT 400 HOSPITALS

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:45.553
ACROSS THE STATE. SO H.R. ONE

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:48.423
REALLY CUTS AT THE HEART OF

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.592
FINANCING FOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS

01:23:50.658 --> 01:23:51.226
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.428
ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:56.264
IT ATTACKS THE WAY TO RAISE

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:59.200
REVENUE TO PAY FOR PROVIDERS. IT

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:01.002
GOES AFTER THE PAYMENTS

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.804
THEMSELVES, AND IT GOES AFTER

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.272
ELIGIBILITY AND COVERAGE FOR

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:07.041
BENEFICIARIES STATES. UNLIKE THE

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:08.543
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, STATES HAVE

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.044
TO BALANCE A BUDGET EVERY YEAR,

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.946
AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:14.382
PAY FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS. YOU

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:16.851
GOT TO PAY FOR SCHOOLS, YOU GOT

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:17.519
TO PAY FOR ROADS, YOU GOT TO PAY

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.020
FOR PARKS. AND IN CALIFORNIA,

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:20.221
THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM IS ONE OF

01:24:20.288 --> 01:24:21.689
THE LARGEST HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:25.493
IN THE COUNTRY. AND SO THIS

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.595
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BACK IN THE

01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:30.899
1990S, CREATED A REGULATORY

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:31.966
FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH CARE

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:34.102
RELATED TAXES TO HELP FINANCE

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:35.603
MEDICAID PROGRAMS ACROSS THE

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:38.106
COUNTRY. BECAUSE FOR MANY, MANY

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.541
DECADES, MEDICAID PROGRAMS

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:41.009
EVERYWHERE HAVE NOT BEEN KNOWN

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:43.545
AS REALLY GOOD PAYERS FOR

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.847
PROVIDERS. AND IN ORDER TO

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.549
MAINTAIN ADEQUATE ACCESS TO

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:50.819
SERVICES. 19 SECTION 1903 THE

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:52.887
SOCIAL SECURITY ACT WAS AMENDED

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:54.722
TO ALLOW FOR THESE KINDS OF

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:57.926
FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, AND THE

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.160
STATE STARTED IMPLEMENTING THESE

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:01.529
IN THE EARLY 2000 FOLLOWING

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:04.732
THE.COM BUST, AND IN 2009

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.100
IMPLEMENTED THE HOSPITAL QUALITY

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:07.569
ASSURANCE FEE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:09.070
FOLLOWING THE GREAT FINANCIAL

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:11.840
CRISIS AND IN THE 1213 FISCAL

01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:13.374
YEAR, WE ELIMINATED THE

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.876
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSISTANCE

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:16.644
COMMISSION, WHICH SET PER DIEM

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.112
RATES AND USED GENERAL FUND TO

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:20.248
PAY RATE INCREASES FOR

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:21.983
HOSPITALS. AND SO THESE

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.818
FRAMEWORKS, WHAT THEY'VE ALLOWED

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:26.054
PROVIDERS TO DO IS TO

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.490
SELF-FINANCE THE RATE INCREASES

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:31.159
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THAT ACCESS

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:33.928
TO CARE. AND SO WHAT H.R. ONE

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:36.898
DOES IS IT RATCHETS DOWN THE

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.399
ABILITY FOR PROVIDERS TO

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:39.501
CONTINUE TO SELF-FINANCE THOSE

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:40.835
THOSE RATE INCREASES AND PUT UP

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:43.771
THE NONFEDERAL SHARE. SO AS

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.907
DIRECTOR BOSS LAID OUT, YOU'VE

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:47.675
GOT THE REDUCTIONS ON THE TAX

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:48.977
SIDE. THEY'RE GOING TO START

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:50.845
RATCHETING DOWN THE AMOUNT OF

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:52.413
TAX THAT CAN BE RAISED STARTING

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.850
IN 2028 BY HALF A PERCENT A

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:58.987
YEAR. AND IT REDUCES THE TOTAL

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:01.623
SIZE OF THESE PROGRAMS FROM 6%

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:03.458
OF TOTAL NET PATIENT REVENUE,

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:06.528
DOWN TO 3.5%. SO THAT'S ON THE

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:08.096
REVENUE GENERATION SIDE. ON THE

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:10.598
PROVIDER PAYMENT SIDE, IT

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:11.766
RATCHETS DOWN PAYMENTS UNTIL

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:14.636
THEY HIT MEDICARE LEVELS. SO

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:17.205
CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA,

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:19.274
HOSPITALS RECEIVE ABOUT $0.80 OF

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.075
EVERY DOLLAR THAT IT COSTS TO

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:23.177
CALIFORNIA TO CARE FOR MEDI-CAL

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:26.147
BENEFICIARY. AND CERTAINLY THAT

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:27.582
NUMBER WILL KIND OF CREEP BACK

01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:29.984
DOWN AS YOU GET TO MEDICARE

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.486
LEVELS. THERE ARE SOME SERVICES,

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:32.921
DEPENDING ON THE HOSPITAL TYPE

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:35.123
AND THE SERVICE DELIVERED. SOME

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:37.025
SERVICES ARE PAID OVER MEDICARE

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.726
RATES. SOME SERVICES ARE PAID

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:40.461
UNDER. BUT WHEN YOU RATCHET THAT

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.130
DOWN AND MAKE IT A CEILING FOR

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:45.400
ALL SERVICES, THEN YOU REALLY

01:26:45.466 --> 01:26:47.001
ARE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:49.103
GOING TO PROVIDERS AND REDUCING

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:52.140
ACCESS. WE ESTIMATE THAT H.R.

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:57.145
ONE WILL RESULT IN BETWEEN 66

01:26:57.211 --> 01:26:58.813
BILLION AND $128 BILLION LOSS IN

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.081
REVENUE TO HOSPITALS OVER A TEN

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:02.717
YEAR PERIOD. THAT'S BETWEEN 14

01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:04.285
AND 30% OF TOTAL HOSPITAL

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:08.256
MEDI-CAL REVENUE. SO THAT'S A

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:11.292
TREMENDOUS, YOU KNOW, RISK FOR

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:13.328
THE SYSTEM AND FOR ACCESS IN THE

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:15.163
MEDI-CAL PROGRAM. THE OTHER, OF

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:16.598
COURSE, HUGE PROBLEM THAT

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:17.899
DIRECTOR BOSS, YOU KNOW, WENT

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:20.401
THROUGH AS WELL IS THE DIRECT

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:22.270
ACCESS TO COVERAGE IN THE

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:24.405
PROGRAM WITH REDETERMINATIONS,

01:27:24.472 --> 01:27:25.907
WITH COST SHARING AND SOME OF

01:27:25.974 --> 01:27:28.710
THE OTHER PROVISIONS. THESE ARE

01:27:28.776 --> 01:27:31.012
REALLY, REALLY DAMAGING TO

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:32.580
BENEFICIARIES THAT HOSPITALS

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:33.982
CARE FOR AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:36.250
SHOW UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM,

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.418
AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:38.519
JEOPARDIZE THE ABILITY OF

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:39.921
HOSPITALS TO KEEP THEIR DOORS

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:40.955
OPEN, BECAUSE THESE

01:27:41.022 --> 01:27:42.557
BENEFICIARIES WILL CONTINUE TO

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:47.228
SHOW UP AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:48.062
EVEN AFTER THEY HAVE LOST

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:50.331
COVERAGE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE

01:27:50.398 --> 01:27:51.432
OTHER SORT OF ELEPHANT IN THE

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:53.735
ROOM IS THAT THE STATE BUDGET IS

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:56.004
YOUR VEHICLE FOR ADDRESSING A

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:57.939
LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS. WE KNOW

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.807
THAT THERE IS A STRUCTURAL

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:01.876
DEFICIT IN THE STATE, AND WE

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:04.012
STAND BY TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:05.780
WITH YOU ALL TO TRY AND

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:08.116
DETERMINE HOW WE CAN HELP COME

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:10.118
UP WITH IDEAS THAT STABILIZE THE

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:11.986
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, STABILIZE

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:13.788
ACCESS FOR MEDI-CAL

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.890
BENEFICIARIES, WHILE

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.558
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ALL HAVE

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:18.926
OTHER PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE THAT

01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:22.463
YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AS WELL,

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:23.598
AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:26.401
ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ADAM,

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:28.936
LINDA CLOSES OUT. THANK YOU.

01:28:29.003 --> 01:28:30.238
GOOD AFTERNOON, LINDA HèA WITH

01:28:30.304 --> 01:28:31.439
WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:32.840
POVERTY. THANKS FOR THE

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:34.709
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND HOSTING

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:37.178
THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THE

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:38.246
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:40.148
SPECIFICALLY THE EXPANSION OF

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:41.482
MEDI-CAL COVERAGE TO ADULTS

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:43.284
WITHOUT DEPENDENT CHILDREN,

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:44.652
EXPANDED COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.821
COVERAGE FOR OVER 5 MILLION

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.289
CALIFORNIANS, COUPLED WITH OTHER

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:49.691
REFORMS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:52.260
COVERED CALIFORNIA, THE STATE

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:53.695
SLASHED THE UNINSURED IN

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:56.164
CALIFORNIA FROM NEARLY 18% IN

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:58.933
2013 TO ABOUT 6 TO 7% FOLLOWING

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.102
THE ACT. ALTHOUGH H.R. ONE DOES

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.404
NOT REPEAL THE ACA, IT THREATENS

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:05.106
TO ROLL BACK THESE COVERAGE

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.641
GAINS FOR LOW INCOME

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:07.842
CALIFORNIANS, THREATENING TO

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:09.911
RETURN CALIFORNIA TO DOUBLE

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:11.713
DIGIT UNINSURED RATES,

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:13.081
SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL DEBT, AND

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:15.283
WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. STUDIES

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:17.485
SHOW THAT MEDI-CAL EXPANSION

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:19.520
RESULTED IN REDUCED DISPARITIES

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:22.457
ACROSS RACE, ETHNICITY, INCOME,

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:24.292
AND EDUCATION LEVELS, AND

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:26.194
DECREASED MORTALITY OVERALL AND

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.196
FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS. IN OTHER

01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:30.465
WORDS, MEDI-CAL COVERAGE IS LIFE

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:33.101
CHANGING AND LIFE SAVING. H.R.

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:34.168
ONE TARGETS THOSE WHO GAIN THE

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:36.037
MOST UNDER MEDI-CAL EXPANSION.

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:38.272
THE WORKING POOR AND ADULTS

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:40.775
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS PRIOR

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.643
TO MEDI-CAL EXPANSION, ONLY

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:43.778
SENIORS, PEOPLE WITH

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:45.813
DISABILITIES, VERY LOW INCOME

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.081
CHILDREN, AND THEIR PARENTS OR

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:48.916
GUARDIANS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.618
MEDI-CAL. HEARKENING BACK TO THE

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:52.186
IDEA THAT ONLY PEOPLE WHO COULD

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:53.988
NOT BE BLAMED FOR THEIR POVERTY

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.890
WERE DESERVING OF HEALTH CARE.

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:59.227
MEDI-CAL EXPANSION RECOGNIZED

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:01.028
THAT HEALTHY PEOPLE MEANS

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:02.530
HEALTHY COMMUNITIES, AND THAT

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:04.031
LOW INCOME PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.800
FORCED TO MAKE DECISIONS ON

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:06.901
WHETHER TO GET MEDICALLY

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:08.269
NECESSARY TREATMENT, INCUR

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:09.604
MEDICAL DEBT, OR GO WITHOUT

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:12.740
CARE. IN FACT, STUDIES SHOW THAT

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.275
MEDI-CAL EXPANSION IS LINKED TO

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:15.710
REDUCTIONS IN POVERTY RATES,

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:17.812
FOOD INSECURITY, AND EVICTIONS

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:19.213
BASED ON OTHER STATES

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.748
EXPERIENCE, WE KNOW THAT WORK

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.183
REQUIREMENTS DO NOT RESULT IN

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.951
MORE PEOPLE WORKING, BUT RATHER

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.353
SIGNIFICANT COVERAGE LOSSES.

01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:27.722
OVER 60% OF ADULTS ON MEDI-CAL

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:29.724
ARE WORKING, AND AN ADDITIONAL

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.859
20% ARE UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:33.327
ILLNESS, DISABILITY, OR

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.129
CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:36.964
PEOPLE ON MEDI-CAL ALREADY HAVE

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:39.467
A DUTY TO REPORT ANY CHANGE IN

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:40.501
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MIGHT IMPACT

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:42.336
THEIR ELIGIBILITY, SUCH AS

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:44.305
CHANGE IN INCOME, FAMILY SIZE,

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:46.874
OR ADDRESS WITHIN TEN DAYS. MORE

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:48.476
FREQUENT REDETERMINATION AND

01:30:48.543 --> 01:30:50.912
WORK REQUIREMENTS CREATE

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:51.846
ADMINISTRATIVE RED TAPE THAT

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:53.781
COULD RESULT IN MILLIONS LOSING

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:55.950
THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE AND

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:57.385
INCREASING CHURN, WHICH REFERS

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:59.187
TO PEOPLE CYCLING ON AND OFF

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.055
MEDI-CAL WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD,

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.157
THE ACA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:04.992
CHURN BY SIMPLIFYING THE

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:07.461
ELIGIBILITY PROCESS, WHILE H.R.

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:09.330
ONE ADDS ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK.

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:11.132
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.500
WILL BE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:13.734
IMPACTED FROM THESE

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:15.002
ADMINISTRATIVE HURDLES NOT

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:16.537
BECAUSE THEY ARE INELIGIBLE, BUT

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:18.105
BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.407
COMPLY WITH MORE ONEROUS

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:21.175
PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS OR

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.210
CHALLENGES. MAINTAINING

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.978
EMPLOYMENT WHILE LACKING STABLE

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:26.214
HOUSING. AT LEAST 75% OF THE

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.549
TOTAL POPULATION EXPERIENCING

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:29.784
HOMELESSNESS IS COVERED BY

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.319
MEDI-CAL. WE EXPECT THIS NUMBER

01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:32.720
TO DROP AND CREATE GREATER

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:34.055
STRAINS ON HOSPITALS AND

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.624
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. HOWEVER,

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.893
CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD TAKE

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.294
INNOVATIVE AND BOLD APPROACHES

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:41.696
TO PROTECT RESIDENTS FROM THESE

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:43.831
FEDERAL CUTBACKS. A RENEWED

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:44.999
COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING SYSTEMS

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:47.401
LIKE DURING THE ORIGINAL ACA

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:49.270
IMPLEMENTATION AND CALAIM

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:51.205
IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE NEEDED TO

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:52.907
MAXIMIZE AUTOMATION THAT KEEPS

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:54.709
MEDI-CAL ACTIVE WHILE BEING

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:56.811
MINDFUL OF AI PITFALLS. BRINGING

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:59.013
MEMBER CENTRIC EFFICIENCIES IN

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.381
TODAY'S CURRENTLY BURDENSOME

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:02.617
MANUAL PROCESSES, AND CENTERING

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:04.185
MEMBERS IN IMPLEMENTATION SO

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:06.153
THAT THERE IS FULL THERE'S

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.456
EFFECTIVE, FULLY TRANSLATED,

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:09.824
UNDERSTANDABLE COMMUNICATION AND

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.592
OUTREACH. WE APPRECIATE THE

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:13.261
LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:14.362
ARE ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:17.398
ON H.R. IMPLEMENTATION, WHICH

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:18.766
UNFORTUNATELY WILL RESULT IN

01:32:18.833 --> 01:32:20.568
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE LOSS. THIS

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:21.903
HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO EXPLORE

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.337
ALL OPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:25.273
THAT I MENTIONED, AS WELL AS NEW

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:27.108
NON REGRESSIVE REVENUE

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:30.244
SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:32.413
TO THE FOUR OF YOU. I'D LIKE TO

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.248
KICK IT OVER TO MY COMMITTEE

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.383
MEMBERS TO START. ANY QUESTIONS.

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:37.585
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU,

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:40.755
MADAM CHAIR, FOR DIRECT DOCTOR

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:43.291
BASS, YOU HAD A SLIDE THAT SAID

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:45.293
THAT THERE WOULD BE RESTRICTIONS

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:46.827
ON LAWFUL IMMIGRANT ELIGIBILITY

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:48.362
FOR MEDI-CAL. I ASSUME THOSE ARE

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:50.231
GOING TO BE FOR THOSE THAT HAVE

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:52.266
A WORK PERMIT OR ARE EVEN

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.001
PERMANENT RESIDENTS. AND ARE

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.903
THOSE RESTRICTIONS ANTICIPATED

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:58.139
TO BE FOR CHRONIC DISEASES, OR

01:32:58.205 --> 01:32:59.807
WHAT TYPE OF RESTRICTIONS DO YOU

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:02.677
THINK ARE GOING TO BE EXISTING?

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:04.078
SO THE RESTRICTIONS THAT I

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.947
MENTIONED ARE RESTRICTIONS IN

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:08.115
CHANGES FOR HOW MUCH THE FEDERAL

01:33:08.182 --> 01:33:09.650
GOVERNMENT COVERS FOR

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:11.852
INDIVIDUALS. SO TODAY, FOR

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:13.921
EXAMPLE, REFUGEES, WE GET FULL

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:15.623
SCOPE COVERAGE FROM THE FEDERAL

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:16.390
GOVERNMENT, MEANING THAT THEY

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:19.660
PAY 5050 WITH US. THE CHANGE

01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:21.696
UNDER H.R. ONE IS SHIFTING THOSE

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:23.998
INDIVIDUALS TO REALLY

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:24.699
UNSATISFACTORY IMMIGRATION

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:26.167
STATUS, WHERE THE STATE NEEDS TO

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:29.036
PICK UP THE FULL COST OF THOSE

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:30.771
NON-EMERGENCY SERVICES. SO THOSE

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.340
CHANGES REALLY RESULT IN A KIND

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:34.208
OF A STATE GENERAL FUND PRESSURE

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:36.210
AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN A

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:37.945
LOSS OF FEDERAL DOLLARS. SO THE

01:33:38.012 --> 01:33:39.180
RESTRICTIONS, THE RESTRICTIONS

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:42.683
ARE ON MONETARY, ON CORRECT, NOT

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.819
NECESSARILY ON THE CARE THAT

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:46.854
THEY NEED. IF IT'S A CHRONIC

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.622
DISEASE, CHANGE IN THE FEDERAL

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:50.391
FUNDING ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.259
IN TERMS OF COVERING FULL SCOPE

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:53.928
VERSUS JUST EMERGENCY SERVICES.

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:55.162
THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT.

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:56.931
THANK YOU. BUT BECAUSE IT'S

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:57.932
MONETARY RESTRICTION, THERE'S A

01:33:57.999 --> 01:34:00.201
POTENTIAL THAT IT COULD LEAD TO

01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:00.801
SERVICE RESTRICTIONS. ALL OF

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:02.670
THESE CHANGES ARE THERE'S JUST

01:34:02.737 --> 01:34:03.270
DEFINITELY STATE BUDGET

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:05.206
PRESSURES REGARDING THE LOSS IN

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:07.041
TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND

01:34:07.108 --> 01:34:09.010
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT ACTIONS

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:13.914
WE WILL NEED TO TAKE. SO NO

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:15.282
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES.

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:17.785
I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS,

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:20.321
SENATOR. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:22.223
CHAIRS. NICE TO SEE ALL OF YOU.

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:24.091
IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET A COPY OF

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:26.060
THE PRESENTATIONS OF ALL THE

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.261
PRESENTERS? WE HAVE THE ONE FROM

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:29.196
THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, BUT

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:30.631
GIVEN THE STATISTICS, THEY'RE

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:32.833
VERY IMPORTANT IN INFORMATION WE

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.202
CAN USE WHEN WE'RE OUT AND ABOUT

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:37.371
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE OF WHAT'S

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:41.809
HAPPENING. THANK YOU. I

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:46.881
REMEMBER. WELL, THIS IS

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:52.720
CONCERNING. SO. I APPRECIATE ALL

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.188
OF THE INFORMATION TODAY. YOU

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:56.290
KNOW, WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:59.360
COMING BEING BOTH ON ASSEMBLY

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:00.928
HEALTH AND ON THE HEALTH BUDGET,

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:03.164
WITH OUR CHAIR SITTING NEXT TO

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:11.105
ME. AND, YOU KNOW, THE IT'S

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:12.873
DIFFICULT TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.775
IMPACT THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:29.423
HAVE. HONESTLY. Þ. AND SO. YOU

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:32.159
KNOW, THE BUT I WANTED TO GO

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:36.597
BACK TO THE TESTIMONY OF MR.

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:38.432
DORSEY JUST TO MAKE SURE I HAD

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.601
THE NUMBERS CORRECT THAT YOU

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:45.306
SAID, AND YOU SAID THAT WITH THE

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:48.175
CHANGE TO THE TAX, IT WOULD MEAN

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:49.944
HOW MUCH IT POSSIBLE LOST

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:54.982
REVENUE. WE THINK IT COULD BE

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:56.784
BETWEEN 66 AND $128 BILLION OVER

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:57.952
A TEN YEAR PERIOD. THE RANGE IS

01:35:58.018 --> 01:36:00.020
REALLY DEPENDENT ON HOW THE

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:01.989
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTERPRETS

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:04.125
THE FEDERAL LAW AS PASSED BY

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:05.025
CONGRESS AND SIGNED BY THE

01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:07.495
PRESIDENT, AND THERE'S A CERTAIN

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:09.396
AMOUNT OF ADMINISTRATIVE

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:10.931
FLEXIBILITY INVOLVED IN ALL OF

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:12.299
THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:13.434
APPROVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:14.969
CURRENTLY PENDING AND THAT SORT

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:17.404
OF THING. AND SO IT'S A WIDE

01:36:17.471 --> 01:36:19.473
RANGE, BUT IT'S REALLY SERIOUS

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:20.541
REGARDLESS WHETHER YOU'RE

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.610
TALKING ABOUT THE LOW END OR THE

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:27.381
HIGH END. RIGHT? SO I WAS

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:31.785
VISITED TODAY BY A HOSPITAL, NOT

01:36:31.852 --> 01:36:33.554
IN MY DISTRICT, BUT THAT I'VE

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:36.991
BEEN WORKING WITH RIDGECREST

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:39.994
HOSPITAL BECAUSE I CHAIR

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.896
MILITARY AND VETERAN AFFAIRS

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:47.701
AND. RIDGECREST IS NEXT TO A

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:50.738
CHINA LAKE NAVY FACILITY. AND

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:52.173
IT'S THIS UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:54.108
IT'S REALLY OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:55.276
THE MOJAVE DESERT. THERE'S NOT

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:58.045
ANOTHER HOSPITAL FOR A HUNDRED

01:36:58.112 --> 01:37:02.716
MILES. THEY ARE REALLY ESSENTIAL

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:04.785
TO THE FUNCTION OF THAT NAVAL

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:06.954
BASE, WHICH DOES REALLY

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:08.756
SPECIALIZED NATIONAL SECURITY

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:12.126
WORK. THEY HAVE INCREDIBLY

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:14.695
BRILLIANT SCIENTISTS WHO CREATE

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:19.934
ROCKET FUELS THEMSELVES. AND,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.502
YOU KNOW, AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:24.305
THINGS. AND THEY HAVE BEEN

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:26.473
FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING,

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:27.341
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, THE

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:29.243
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HELPED

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:30.611
THEM OUT HERE AND THERE, BUT

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:33.948
THEY'RE NOT RIGHT NOW TALKING

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:36.817
ABOUT HELPING THEM OUT. AND THEY

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:39.720
HAD TO CLOSE THEIR LABOR AND

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:41.922
DELIVERY UNIT. THEY WERE ABLE TO

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:44.525
GET ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO REOPEN

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:46.193
THAT. AND NOW THEY'RE FACING

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:49.129
POSSIBLE CLOSURE OF THAT. AGAIN,

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:51.632
WE KNOW THAT ESPECIALLY IN OUR

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:54.902
RURAL COMMUNITIES, THAT THAT,

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:56.937
YOU KNOW, THIS FUNDING IS SO

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:59.240
CRITICAL TO SUSTAIN HOSPITALS,

01:37:59.306 --> 01:38:01.475
WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY AND IN

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:02.776
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:07.114
REALLY RELY ON. ON THESE

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:13.187
MEDI-CAL DOLLARS. AND SO, YOU

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:15.889
KNOW, IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:17.758
RHETORIC GOING AROUND ABOUT WHY

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:19.360
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO FIGHT BACK

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:23.564
RIGHT NOW. AND JUST THAT ONE

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:26.533
REASON WE HAD PRESENTATIONS FROM

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.602
FOUR PEOPLE ABOUT MANY, MANY

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:30.437
THINGS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:33.407
H.R. ONE THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:38:33.474 --> 01:38:36.210
REMOVING, LIMITING, TAKING AWAY

01:38:36.277 --> 01:38:38.679
HEALTHCARE FROM MILLIONS OF

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:43.550
CALIFORNIANS. AND JUST THAT ONE

01:38:43.617 --> 01:38:44.785
REASON WILL LEAD TO HOSPITAL

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:53.861
CLOSURES. AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:55.429
CERTAINLY SOBERING TO HEAR THE

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:57.131
REAL IMPACT OF WHAT THIS IS

01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:58.966
GOING TO BE. WE KNEW IT WAS

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:00.934
GOING TO BE REALLY BAD. IT'S

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:02.936
HORRIFIC. AND I THINK IT'S GOING

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:06.840
TO BE CRITICAL THAT WE GET VERY

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:10.511
CREATIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:39:10.577 --> 01:39:12.379
OUR CONTINUE TO BE AS

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:15.182
RESOURCEFUL AS WE CAN AND

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:17.084
CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN EVERY WAY

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:20.054
THAT WE CAN TO KEEP ALL OF THE

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:20.587
DOLLARS THAT CALIFORNIA

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:22.256
DESERVES, THOSE $80 BILLION THAT

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:24.191
WE PAY IN TAXES, THAT SHOULD BE

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:27.861
COMING BACK TO CALIFORNIA. THAT

01:39:27.928 --> 01:39:30.631
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.499
EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:33.467
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:34.568
PROTECTING CALIFORNIA IN EVERY

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:37.104
WAY WE CAN. SO THANK YOU FOR ALL

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:38.405
THAT YOU DO. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:40.240
PRESENTATION AND THE INFORMATION

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:42.009
TODAY, AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:45.546
WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU. THANK

01:39:45.612 --> 01:39:47.848
YOU, MADAM CHAIR, AND THANK YOU

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:49.416
TO EACH OF OUR PRESENTERS. I

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:50.517
KNOW HOW HARD YOU'VE BEEN

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:52.920
WORKING ON THIS. WE HELD IN THE

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.355
HEALTH BUDGET SUB. I THINK WE

01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:56.190
HAD AT LEAST FIVE HEARINGS IN

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:57.958
THE FULL BUDGET, 11 HEARINGS,

01:39:58.025 --> 01:39:59.760
AND ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:02.329
THESE. WE TALKED ABOUT CUTS TO

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:04.231
THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM, CUTS TO

01:40:04.298 --> 01:40:06.667
THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, THE

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:08.736
DETRIMENTAL NATURE OF H.R. ONE.

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:10.471
AND YOU MAY HAVE COVERED THIS AT

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.406
THE TOP OF YOUR TESTIMONY. SO

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:14.074
PLEASE EXCUSE ME IF I'M ASKING

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:16.944
YOU TO REPEAT, BUT A LOT OF OUR

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:18.746
FOCUS, A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:21.382
HAS BEEN ABOUT HOW THE CUTS WILL

01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:24.551
AFFECT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.520
INSURANCE NOW OR WHO HAVE HEALTH

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:28.922
COVERAGE NOW, THE 94, WE HAVE

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:31.125
94% OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:33.227
COVERED NOW. WE EXPECT A HUGE

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:34.762
DECREASE, 15 MILLION

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:36.930
CALIFORNIANS. WE EXPECT AT LEAST

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:38.165
2 MILLION, IF NOT MORE, TO LOSE

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:39.633
THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. BUT

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:43.737
COULD YOU JUST PUT SOME SOME

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.773
COLOR, SOME CONTOUR OF WHAT THAT

01:40:45.839 --> 01:40:47.608
MEANS FOR THE REST OF

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:48.776
CALIFORNIA? WHEN YOU HAVE 2

01:40:48.842 --> 01:40:50.844
MILLION PEOPLE THAT LOSE HEALTH

01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:52.246
COVERAGE, WHAT KIND OF PRESSURES

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:54.782
DOES THAT PUT ON THE REST OF THE

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:57.351
SYSTEM THAT THAT OTHER PEOPLE

01:40:57.418 --> 01:40:59.653
ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.622
FEEL, SOME OF WHOM REALLY

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:03.457
BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE JUST

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:05.793
DON'T DESERVE HEALTH CARE, BUT

01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:08.929
OTHERS OF WHOM BELIEVE THAT A

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:10.764
COST SAVING MEASURE AT ANY COST,

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:12.433
IS A GOOD COST SAVING MEASURE

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:15.035
AND DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:17.204
ADJUNCTIVE EFFECTS OF CUTTING

01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:19.039
CARE AND HOW THAT WILL AFFECT

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.474
THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. AND IF

01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:22.709
YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO THAT

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:25.045
BRIEFLY, WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:26.914
WHOEVER AND MAYBE EACH OF YOU

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:27.981
HAVE DIFFERENT LANES ON THIS,

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:29.783
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.285
EACH OF YOU. I'M HAPPY TO START

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:33.487
JUST WELL, I KIND OF TALK ABOUT

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:34.855
THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM. I THINK

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.857
THESE CUTS AND THESE CHANGES ARE

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:38.559
BROADER THAN JUST MEDI-CAL. IF

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:40.160
YOU THINK ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:42.162
INDUSTRY LOSING TENS OF BILLIONS

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:43.797
OF DOLLARS, JUST THE HEALTH CARE

01:41:43.864 --> 01:41:45.165
INDUSTRY IN GENERAL, THAT MEANS

01:41:45.232 --> 01:41:47.134
CLOSURES. THAT MEANS CHANGES TO

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:48.702
WHERE PEOPLE GET THEIR CARE AND

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:49.970
NOT JUST PEOPLE ON MEDI-CAL. IT

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:51.772
IS INDIVIDUALS WANTING TO GO TO

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:53.240
AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THAT IS

01:41:53.307 --> 01:41:54.575
NO LONGER THERE BECAUSE, YOU

01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:56.176
KNOW, IT MAY NOT HAVE THE

01:41:56.243 --> 01:41:57.010
FUNDING TO DO SO. AND ANOTHER

01:41:57.077 --> 01:41:58.479
TOPIC THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY

01:41:58.545 --> 01:42:00.614
TALKED ABOUT IS WORKFORCE. ALL

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:02.049
OF THE JOBS THAT WILL BE LOST AS

01:42:02.115 --> 01:42:04.384
A RESULT OF THE CLOSURES OR THE

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:06.420
REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES AS A, AS

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:07.554
A POTENTIAL. I MEAN, THESE ARE

01:42:07.621 --> 01:42:09.690
POTENTIALS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE

01:42:09.756 --> 01:42:11.425
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUNDING

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:13.494
BEING SWEPT OUT OF OUR HEALTH

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.695
CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM, IT IS

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:16.296
BROADER THAN THE MEDI-CAL

01:42:16.363 --> 01:42:17.164
PROGRAM. IT'S BROADER THAN

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:20.133
COVERED CALIFORNIA. IT IS. IT IS

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.870
A SECTOR WIDE ISSUE. I COULDN'T

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:25.205
AGREE MORE. I WAS REMINDED BY A

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:26.974
HOSPITAL IN A RURAL AREA TODAY.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.775
THEY ARE BY FAR THE BIGGEST

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:31.378
EMPLOYER IN THEIR TOWN. SOME OF

01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:33.080
THESE HOSPITALS ARE ALREADY

01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:35.983
REALLY ON THE BRINK. AND OUR

01:42:36.049 --> 01:42:38.485
BOSS VERY HELPFULLY REMINDS US

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:40.254
THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT A

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.622
DOOR WHEN YOU WALK IN THE

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:43.123
EMERGENCY ROOM FOR MEDI-CAL

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:44.658
BENEFICIARY AND A COMMERCIAL

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:46.693
COVERAGE BENEFICIARY. IF THE

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.161
HOSPITAL CLOSES, THE HOSPITAL

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:51.098
CLOSES FOR EVERYBODY. SO YEAH, I

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:52.866
JUST COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT

01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:55.502
THAT THE IMPACTS OF THIS ARE

01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:57.271
UNFORTUNATELY GOING TO BE

01:42:57.337 --> 01:42:59.773
WIDESPREAD. MAYBE JUST TO FOLLOW

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.642
UP, NOT TO PUT PLANNED

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:03.010
PARENTHOOD ON THE SPOT, BUT WE

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:05.045
ALREADY HAD ONE CLOSURE, MAYBE

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.914
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN SANTA

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.116
CRUZ COUNTY. THEY SAID THAT DUE

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:10.851
TO CUTS, THEY WERE LOSING $7

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:11.985
MILLION A MONTH. AND SO THE

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:14.054
CLINIC IS CLOSED. IT'S NOT GOING

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:15.322
TO REOPEN. WHAT KIND OF IMPACT

01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:17.157
DOES THAT HAVE ON THE REST OF

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:18.859
THE SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:20.193
FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.262
CARE? YEAH, THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:43:22.329 --> 01:43:24.364
QUESTION. SO ONE OF THE PLANNED

01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:25.299
PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES DID HAVE

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:26.867
TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT DECISION

01:43:26.934 --> 01:43:28.502
TO CLOSE FIVE HEALTH CENTERS

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:31.004
ALREADY SINCE THE JULY 4TH

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:34.141
SIGNING OF THIS BILL. SO THAT

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:36.577
IS, YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID IN MY

01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:37.844
TESTIMONY, THE MEDI-CAL SYSTEM

01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:40.147
CANNOT FULLY ABSORB THE

01:43:40.213 --> 01:43:40.881
REPRODUCTIVE AND ABORTION

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:42.683
HEALTHCARE NEEDS THAT PLANNED

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:43.617
PARENTHOOD PROVIDES. IF PLANNED

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:45.152
PARENTHOOD WERE TO NO LONGER

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:47.754
EXIST IN THE STATE BUT THE

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:48.689
NEIGHBORING HEALTH CENTERS,

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:49.790
DEPENDING ON WHERE THOSE

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:52.125
LOCATIONS ARE, DO HAVE TO OPEN

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:54.661
UP THEIR DOORS TO TAKE ON THESE

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.396
PATIENTS. LIKE I SAID, 25,000

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:59.166
PER WEEK IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:01.001
IT'S ABOUT 22,000, I BELIEVE, OF

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:03.770
THOSE FIVE. SO THEY WILL NEED TO

01:44:03.837 --> 01:44:05.005
BE ABSORBED BY OTHER HEALTH

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:07.107
CENTERS. AND I DO WANT TO AGREE

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:08.141
WITH MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE AS

01:44:08.208 --> 01:44:10.243
WELL THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:11.345
JOBS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:44:11.411 --> 01:44:12.746
PATIENTS. AND FOR OUR HEALTH

01:44:12.813 --> 01:44:14.548
CENTERS, ONCE THOSE ARE CLOSED,

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:20.120
THEY ARE NOT REOPENING. SO

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:22.489
REMEMBER AND THEN WE'LL TURN TO

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:24.024
THE CENTER. THANK YOU FOR

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:25.826
PROVIDING ALL OF YOUR TESTIMONY

01:44:25.892 --> 01:44:28.195
AND DETAILED INFORMATION. I HAVE

01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:31.231
A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION ON THE

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:32.599
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.968

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:36.937
ELIGIBILITY FOR PEOPLE. FROM MY

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:41.008
HUGE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON

01:44:41.074 --> 01:44:42.576
THE SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:44:42.643 --> 01:44:44.244
DO WE HAVE COST ESTIMATES OF

01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:46.346
WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE? WE

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:47.681
DON'T YET. THAT IS SOMETHING

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:48.782
THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH RIGHT

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:51.018
NOW. OKAY. THANK YOU. I WOULD

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:51.985
LOVE TO GET FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:54.221
WHEN YOU HAVE IT, JUST BECAUSE

01:44:54.287 --> 01:44:55.322
WE'RE TRYING TO SEE WHERE THAT

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:57.257
COST SHIFT IS GOING TO GO,

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:58.759
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IN SOME

01:44:58.825 --> 01:45:00.093
WAY, WE ARE CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.728
GOING TO BEAR THE COST OF MAKING

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:04.297
SURE THAT PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:45:04.364 --> 01:45:05.832

INITIAL KIND OF OUTLAY OF, OF

01:45:28.822 --> 01:45:30.957
THE LANDSCAPE. JUST HAVE A

01:45:31.024 --> 01:45:33.660
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. I'LL START,

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:35.962
I GUESS, BY PIGGYBACKING ON THE

01:45:36.029 --> 01:45:37.798
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS QUESTION AROUND

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:42.035
ELIGIBILITY. SO. HAVE YOU ALL

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:45.372
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW PATIENTS WILL

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:47.040
BE NOTIFIED IF THEY ARE NO

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.309
LONGER ELIGIBLE, AND HOW YOU ARE

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:52.946
ALSO GOING TO BE NOTIFYING

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:55.482
PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS? YOU

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:57.117
KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.352
VERY CHALLENGING FOR PROVIDERS

01:45:59.419 --> 01:46:02.222
AND HOSPITALS AND ALSO PATIENTS

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:03.724
IS THINKING THAT THEY HAVE

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:05.726
INSURANCE AND THEN SHOWING UP TO

01:46:05.792 --> 01:46:08.829
CLINIC OR, YOU KNOW, THE DAY OF

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:11.298
A PROCEDURE AND REALIZING THAT

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:14.101
SOMETHING HAS LAPSED. SO DO YOU

01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:17.037
HAVE SOME KIND OF PROCESS

01:46:17.104 --> 01:46:18.438
CURRENTLY, WHICH I KNOW IS A

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:20.941
LITTLE FLAWED FROM WHAT PEOPLE

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:23.009
HAVE TOLD ME, BUT ALSO JUST FROM

01:46:23.076 --> 01:46:24.678
MY OWN EXPERIENCE? OR HAVE YOU

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:26.012
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:29.416
TO DO THIS? SO THAT IS SOMETHING

01:46:29.483 --> 01:46:30.650
THAT WE'RE THINKING THROUGH

01:46:30.717 --> 01:46:32.486
RIGHT NOW. SO FOR THESE

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:33.153
ELIGIBILITY CHANGES, THEY MOSTLY

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.388
GO INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1ST,

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:37.524
2027. SO AS PART OF OUR PLANNING

01:46:37.591 --> 01:46:38.425
FOR GETTING READY, WHETHER IT'S

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.160
THE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS,

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:41.862
THE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKER

01:46:41.928 --> 01:46:43.764
TRAINING, PROVIDER ENGAGEMENT,

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:44.765
THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:46.133
PLANNING FOR RIGHT NOW TO KIND

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:48.401
OF SET UP A PROCESS BY WHICH WE

01:46:48.468 --> 01:46:50.504
CAN BE HAVE A GOOD, ROBUST

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:52.572
COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL AND TOOLS

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:54.474
TO HELP US MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:56.810
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CHANGES ARE,

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.111
WHERE, WHERE THEY'RE GOING. I

01:46:58.178 --> 01:47:00.046
WILL SAY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME,

01:47:00.113 --> 01:47:01.782
GIVEN SOME OF THE STATE BUDGET

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:02.415
CHANGES, WE ACTUALLY CAME OUT

01:47:02.482 --> 01:47:03.850
WITH COMMUNICATIONS REALLY

01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:05.285
FOCUSED ON OUR MEMBERS AND

01:47:05.352 --> 01:47:06.820
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.688
THAT WORK WITH OUR MEMBERS,

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:09.689
OUTLINING OUR BUDGET, OUR STATE

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:11.825
BUDGET CHANGES THAT WE JUST

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:13.426
ADOPTED, REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:15.061
OUR OUR COMMS AND OUR OUTREACH

01:47:15.128 --> 01:47:17.664
REALLY STRATEGICALLY TO TOUCH

01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:18.298
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THERE, WHO

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:20.100
CAN SUPPORT OUR MEMBERS. I WILL

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.501
ALSO HIGHLIGHT WE HAVE OUR

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:23.703
COVERAGE AMBASSADORS, WHICH WAS

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.071
AN INITIATIVE WE LAUNCHED AS

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:26.406
PART OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:27.741
EMERGENCY UNWINDING. WE HAVE

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:29.476
OVER 8000 INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:31.545
SIGNED UP AS OUR AMBASSADORS.

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:33.380
AND WE ARE WE ARE DEVELOPING

01:47:33.446 --> 01:47:34.581
TOOLKITS. WE'RE DEVELOPING

01:47:34.648 --> 01:47:36.416
MESSAGING USING THOSE TRUSTED

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:37.784
COMMUNITY PARTNERS AS A WAY TO

01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:39.119
DO THIS OUTREACH TO OUR MEMBERS.

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:40.687
BUT WE'RE AT THE VERY BEGINNING

01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:42.189
STAGES TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:44.524
THESE STEPS. OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:49.529
AND WITH THE ONE YEAR BAN ON

01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:50.897
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS

01:47:50.964 --> 01:47:53.900
LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD, WHAT IS

01:47:53.967 --> 01:47:57.904
THE FIRST OF ALL IS THAT FROM

01:47:57.971 --> 01:48:01.675
JANUARY 4TH, I GUESS, 2025 TO

01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:03.977
JANUARY 4TH, 2026, IS THAT THE

01:48:04.044 --> 01:48:07.247
THOUGHT PROCESS? YEAH, THAT'S

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:08.381
HOW WE'RE TREATING IT. IT WAS

01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:10.750
WENT INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SO

01:48:10.817 --> 01:48:12.552
THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, JULY 4TH

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:14.788
SIGNED AND THEN INTO JULY OF

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:16.656
NEXT YEAR. SO PRETTY MUCH ON THE

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:18.925
FISCAL YEAR. OKAY. AND WITH

01:48:18.992 --> 01:48:20.093
THESE INJUNCTIONS IT WOULDN'T

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.596
PUSH ANYTHING BACK. RIGHT. NO.

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:25.532
OKAY. AND IS HAS THERE BEEN ANY

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:27.400
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:31.338
AFTER JANUARY 4TH, 2026? I

01:48:31.404 --> 01:48:34.241
THINK, YOU KNOW, WE CANNOT SAY

01:48:34.307 --> 01:48:36.376
WHETHER THAT POLICY WILL OR WILL

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:37.777
NOT BE EXTENDED. AND I DON'T

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.479
THINK WE'RE TAKING FOR GRANTED

01:48:39.546 --> 01:48:41.381
THAT IT WILL GO EITHER

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:43.650
DIRECTION. WE ARE AT THIS TIME

01:48:43.717 --> 01:48:45.785
TRYING TO PLAN TO CONTINUE

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:47.153
OPERATIONS, YOU KNOW, EVEN ON A

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.656
DAY TO DAY BASIS, WITH THE

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:51.524
VOLATILITY OF THE LITIGATION AND

01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:52.893
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY

01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:54.628
AND HOW QUICKLY THE LIGHTS CAN

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:57.564
AND CANNOT GO OFF. SO WE ARE NOT

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:59.833
PLANNING ON IT BEING EXTENDED OR

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.534
NOT BEING EXTENDED. EITHER WAY.

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:03.403
I THINK THAT THAT REALLY CAN BE

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:04.905
UP IN THE AIR. BUT YOU HAVEN'T

01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:06.106
HEARD ANYTHING FROM LIKE YOUR

01:49:06.172 --> 01:49:07.674
FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS OR THE

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:09.609
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DC ABOUT

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:10.877
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN ANY

01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:12.345
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:17.083
TO HAPPEN AFTER JULY 4TH, 2026.

01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:19.819
WE ARE, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE,

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:22.088
TRACKING IT. I THINK THAT THE

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:23.857
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:25.292
CURRENT CONGRESS HAS MADE IT

01:49:25.358 --> 01:49:27.794
VERY CLEAR THAT DEFUNDING

01:49:27.861 --> 01:49:30.330
PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS A PRIORITY

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.565
OF THEIRS, AND THAT SHOULD THEY

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:35.669
BE ABLE TO, THEY WOULD. THE BILL

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:37.904
AS INTRODUCED WAS A TEN YEAR

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:40.040
PLANNED PARENTHOOD DEFUNDING,

01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:42.542
AND IT WAS AMENDED TO ONE YEAR

01:49:42.609 --> 01:49:45.578
IN THE SECOND HOUSE, IN THE

01:49:45.645 --> 01:49:48.048
SENATE. SO MOVING FROM THE

01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:50.083
SENATE. SO THAT WAS PART OF THE

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:54.421
YOU KNOW. CHANGES TO MOVE THAT

01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:56.957
POLICY THROUGH THE CONGRESS AND

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:59.125
PASS IT. SO GIVEN THAT IT WAS

01:49:59.192 --> 01:50:00.327
INITIALLY TEN YEARS, I DON'T

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:02.395
HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WOULD

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:04.597
NOT EXTEND IT IF ABLE TO. THANK

01:50:04.664 --> 01:50:08.401
YOU FOR THAT. REALLY CONCERNED

01:50:08.468 --> 01:50:12.505
ABOUT THE PROHIBITION AROUND THE

01:50:12.572 --> 01:50:16.676
MCO TAX. WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:17.844
CONVERSATIONS FOR MANY, MANY,

01:50:17.911 --> 01:50:20.013
MANY YEARS ABOUT MEDICAID

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.983
REIMBURSEMENT RATES, THE NEED TO

01:50:23.049 --> 01:50:24.317
INCREASE OUR MEDICAID

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:25.785
REIMBURSEMENT RATES, AND

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:27.687
UTILIZATION OF THE MCO TAX FOR

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:32.225
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO HAVE YOU

01:50:32.292 --> 01:50:35.462
ALL STARTED THINKING ABOUT HOW.

01:50:35.528 --> 01:50:36.930
WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:50:36.997 --> 01:50:38.465
INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO EVEN

01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:41.901
SEE MEDI-CAL PATIENTS,

01:50:41.968 --> 01:50:44.804
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:46.206
FINANCIALLY THEY HAVE SAID IT'S

01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:50.510
JUST OFTENTIMES NOT FISCALLY

01:50:50.577 --> 01:50:51.845
POSSIBLE OR FINANCIALLY

01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:55.882
POSSIBLE. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:57.450
GOING THROUGH H.R. ONE AND THE

01:50:57.517 --> 01:50:58.852
MCO PROVISIONS, OR THE PROVIDER

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:01.054
TAX PROVISIONS AND THE POTENTIAL

01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:02.956
FEDERAL RULE RELATED TO PROVIDER

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:04.457
TAXES AND TRYING TO ASSESS, YOU

01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:06.059
KNOW, THE MODELING FOR THIS,

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:07.927
WHAT WHAT THE KIND OF THE NEW

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:08.995
FRAMEWORK COULD LOOK LIKE. BUT

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:10.864
WE HAVE NOT KIND OF THOUGHT

01:51:10.930 --> 01:51:12.399
ABOUT HOW ELSE TO INCENTIVIZE

01:51:12.465 --> 01:51:13.767
OUR PROVIDERS TO PARTICIPATE IN

01:51:13.833 --> 01:51:15.468
THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM.

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:18.038
INTERESTING. OKAY. AND MY LAST

01:51:18.104 --> 01:51:20.507
QUESTION. SO WITH THESE

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:22.208
POTENTIAL NEW COST SHARING

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:23.743
REQUIREMENTS, HOW EXACTLY IS

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:25.545
THAT GOING TO HAVE YOU THOUGHT

01:51:25.612 --> 01:51:27.247
ABOUT HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK?

01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:29.516
LIKE HOW WOULD SOMEONE WHO'S

01:51:29.582 --> 01:51:31.284
COMING UP, WHO'S ON MEDI-CAL

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.420
KNOW THAT THEY'VE GOT TO PAY $35

01:51:33.486 --> 01:51:36.589
BASED ON WHAT THEY MADE THIS

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:38.158
YEAR AND NEXT YEAR? MAYBE THEY

01:51:38.224 --> 01:51:39.492
PAY 25. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

01:51:39.559 --> 01:51:41.661
HOW THAT IS GOING TO WORK? THAT

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:42.796
PROVISION DOES NOT GO INTO

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:45.031
EFFECT UNTIL OCTOBER 1ST, 2028.

01:51:45.098 --> 01:51:46.800
SO RIGHT NOW IN THE ELIGIBILITY

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:48.468
SPACE, WE ARE DEFINITELY MORE

01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:49.903
FOCUSED ON THE WORK REQUIREMENTS

01:51:49.969 --> 01:51:51.738
IN THE SEMIANNUAL

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:52.839
REDETERMINATIONS, WHICH GO INTO

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:54.207
EFFECT ALMOST TWO YEARS EARLIER.

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:55.842
AND SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:57.410
WILL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH AS WE

01:51:57.477 --> 01:51:59.212
PLAN FOR COST SHARING. THANK

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:05.085
YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'LL

01:52:05.151 --> 01:52:05.685
START WITH QUESTIONS WITH YOU,

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:06.920
DIRECTOR ON THE WORKER

01:52:06.986 --> 01:52:08.588
REQUIREMENT. WHAT OPTIONS DO WE

01:52:08.655 --> 01:52:10.090
HAVE OR WHAT OPTIONS ARE

01:52:10.156 --> 01:52:11.591
AVAILABLE FOR US TO DELAY THE

01:52:11.658 --> 01:52:13.359
START OF THE IMPLEMENTATION? SO

01:52:13.426 --> 01:52:15.395
THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY, AND WE

01:52:15.462 --> 01:52:16.129
DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS ON THIS

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:17.997
PROCESS FOR STATES TO REQUEST A

01:52:18.064 --> 01:52:19.766
DELAY FOR UP TO TWO YEARS. SO

01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:21.901
THROUGH DECEMBER 31ST, 2028,

01:52:21.968 --> 01:52:24.838
INSTEAD OF HAVING AN EFFECTIVE

01:52:24.904 --> 01:52:25.905
JANUARY 1ST, 2027, AS LONG AS

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:27.340
THE STATE IS MAKING A GOOD FAITH

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:29.476
EFFORT. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:30.376
MORE DETAILS ON THAT PROCESS.

01:52:30.443 --> 01:52:32.011
BUT THAT IS PART OF H.R. ONE

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.847
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE KIND OF

01:52:33.913 --> 01:52:35.281
PLANNING TO IMPLEMENT, BUT WE'LL

01:52:35.348 --> 01:52:37.817
BE ALSO EXPLORING THAT OPTION.

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:39.586
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE H.R.

01:52:39.652 --> 01:52:41.387
ONE, REQUIRES THE ACTUAL

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:42.856
GUIDANCE FROM CMS TO BE

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:46.392
AVAILABLE JUNE 2026. SO WE STILL

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:48.027
HAVE MONTHS AWAY FROM WHEN WE

01:52:48.094 --> 01:52:49.429
WOULD EXPECT FEDERAL GUIDANCE ON

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:51.397
HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS. SO LOTS

01:52:51.464 --> 01:52:53.933
OF JUST, YOU KNOW, LOTS OF

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:54.501
UNCERTAINTY, I WOULD GUESS I

01:52:54.567 --> 01:52:56.169
WOULD SAY, DO WE EXPECT ALL

01:52:56.236 --> 01:52:57.370
FEDERAL REGULATION GUIDANCE TO

01:52:57.437 --> 01:52:59.439
COME DOWN ON THAT DATE? THAT IS

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:01.007
ONE OF THE THERE'S ONLY A FEW

01:53:01.074 --> 01:53:01.941
PROVISIONS WHERE THERE'S A

01:53:02.008 --> 01:53:03.176
SPECIFIC DATE THAT H.R. ONE

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:04.177
PROVIDES, AND THAT IS ONE OF

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:05.912
THEM FOR THE WORK REQUIREMENTS.

01:53:05.979 --> 01:53:07.413
AS WE'RE LOOKING AT COLLECTING

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.781
THIS WORKER REQUIREMENT DATA,

01:53:08.848 --> 01:53:10.917
ARE WE LOOKING TO DO THIS AT A

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:13.520
COUNTY LEVEL, OR ARE WE GOING TO

01:53:13.586 --> 01:53:14.287
DO STATEWIDE PLATFORM TO COLLECT

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:17.023
OR. SO CURRENTLY THIS IS DONE AT

01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:18.691
THE KIND OF THE COUNTY

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:19.325
ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS. AND ALSO,

01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:20.160
YOU KNOW, WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY

01:53:20.226 --> 01:53:22.395
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

01:53:22.462 --> 01:53:23.530
SERVICES AS THEY THINK ABOUT

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:25.665
THEIR CALFRESH REQUIREMENTS AND

01:53:25.732 --> 01:53:26.666
CALWORKS REQUIREMENTS IN THIS

01:53:26.733 --> 01:53:28.234
SPACE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW

01:53:28.301 --> 01:53:30.370
DO WE AUTOMATE AS MUCH AS

01:53:30.436 --> 01:53:31.738
POSSIBLE, HOW DO WE TAKE

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.240
ADVANTAGE OF WHEN THE CLIENT IS

01:53:34.307 --> 01:53:36.075
BEFORE THE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.243
WORKER. AND SO REALLY TRYING TO

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:39.345
PLAN FOR AN INTEGRATED,

01:53:39.412 --> 01:53:41.114
SEAMLESS, REALLY AUTOMATED

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:42.916
PROCESS IN THIS SPACE, ARE WE

01:53:42.982 --> 01:53:44.384
THINKING ABOUT POSSIBLY TAKING

01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:45.485
ADVANTAGE OF THE ABILITY TO

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:46.819
COLLECT THIS EXTRA DATA, TO LOOK

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:50.089
AT IT STATEWIDE, JUST TO HAVE

01:53:50.156 --> 01:53:51.257
MORE? YOU KNOW, AS WE'RE HAVING

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:53.293
WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS WE

01:53:53.359 --> 01:53:54.294
ALWAYS TURN TO LIKE, WE DON'T

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.062
HAVE THIS DATA AT THE STATE

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:57.230
LEVEL. IT'S AT THE COUNTY LEVEL.

01:53:57.297 --> 01:53:59.232
AND IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US TO

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:00.200
COLLECT THIS, ALL THIS

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:01.134
INFORMATION. ARE THERE

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:02.001
CONVERSATIONS OR THOUGHTS AROUND

01:54:02.068 --> 01:54:04.604
MAKING THIS MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:06.072
STATEWIDE POLICY DOWN THE LINE?

01:54:06.139 --> 01:54:08.508
TO BE ABLE TO TURN TO THIS DATA?

01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:10.743
IN TERMS OF THE COLLECTION OF SO

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.812
SOME OF THIS INFORMATION WE RELY

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:15.181
ON OTHER EDD OR WE COULD RELY ON

01:54:15.248 --> 01:54:16.816
SOME OF THE OTHER ENTITIES.

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:17.917
WE'RE ALSO EXPLORING

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:19.118
PARTNERSHIPS WITH èC AND HIGHER

01:54:19.185 --> 01:54:21.187
ED ON IF WE CAN. THEY CAN MEET

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:22.188
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

01:54:22.255 --> 01:54:23.756
REQUIREMENTS BY ACCESSING THAT

01:54:23.823 --> 01:54:25.225
DATA AND SEEING IF THAT'S

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:26.259
AVAILABLE. SO WE'RE THINKING

01:54:26.326 --> 01:54:27.961
THROUGH ALL DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO

01:54:28.027 --> 01:54:29.229
THIS. BUT I WILL SAY THAT KIND

01:54:29.295 --> 01:54:30.997
OF THAT COUNTY ELIGIBILITY AND

01:54:31.064 --> 01:54:32.232
THE CAL HERS AND CAL SAU SYSTEMS

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:34.834
ARE COUNTY RUN COUNTY KIND OF

01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:38.071
BASED RULES ENGINES. OKAY. I'D

01:54:38.137 --> 01:54:39.038
LIKE TO CONTINUE. I THINK WE'D

01:54:39.105 --> 01:54:41.474
BE INTERESTED IN THAT STATEWIDE

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:43.076
JUST TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THOSE

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:44.377
PARTNERS YOU JUST MENTIONED,

01:54:44.444 --> 01:54:46.813
LIKE ED, ON THE REDETERMINATION,

01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:48.514
YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE

01:54:48.581 --> 01:54:49.882
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT. IS THE IDD

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:52.151
POPULATION EXEMPTED FROM THE

01:54:52.218 --> 01:54:54.254
BIANNUAL. NOW, REDETERMINATION,

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.656
CAN YOU SAY FOR THE

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:57.423
REDETERMINATION NOW EVERY SIX

01:54:57.490 --> 01:54:59.259
MONTHS? CORRECT. IT'S THE IDD

01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:01.160
POPULATION EXEMPTED FROM THAT,

01:55:01.227 --> 01:55:02.895
OR IF THEY ARE PART OF THE

01:55:02.962 --> 01:55:04.264
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MEDICAID

01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:05.732
EXPANSION POPULATION, THEY ARE

01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:07.267
NOT EXEMPT. AND SO IT DEPENDS ON

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:08.968
THE CATEGORY, THEIR AID CODE

01:55:09.035 --> 01:55:10.703
CATEGORY. AND SO I CAN'T ANSWER

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:13.006
THAT EXPLICITLY, BUT IT REALLY

01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:14.807
DOES DEPEND ON AID CODE. OKAY.

01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:16.943
AND THEN GOING BACK TO THE MCO

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:19.846
CONVERSATION, THE NEW POLICIES

01:55:19.912 --> 01:55:21.247
OR GUIDANCE. DOES THAT IMPACT

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:23.383
OUR CURRENT MCO TAX OR THE

01:55:23.449 --> 01:55:24.951
FUTURE ONES. SO THIS IS WHERE

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:26.919
THERE'S A BIT OF I WOULDN'T SAY

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:29.122
UNCERTAINTY, BUT OUR CURRENT MCO

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:31.391
TAX FRAMEWORK IS DOES NOT MEET

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:32.692
THE REQUIREMENTS OF H.R. ONE,

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:34.260
BUT IT DOES PROVIDE H.R. ONE

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:35.895
DOES PROVIDE FOR A THREE YEAR

01:55:35.962 --> 01:55:37.030
TRANSITION PERIOD APPROVED BY

01:55:37.096 --> 01:55:39.365
THE FEDERAL HHS SECRETARY. SO WE

01:55:39.432 --> 01:55:40.967
WILL APPLY FOR THAT TRANSITION

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:42.835
PERIOD. WE CHECK REGULARLY WITH

01:55:42.902 --> 01:55:44.671
CMS ON WHAT'S THE CRITERIA, WHAT

01:55:44.737 --> 01:55:46.439
WILL THE PROCESS BE FOR THAT?

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:47.840
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS OR

01:55:47.907 --> 01:55:50.143
PROCESS TO KIND OF RELAY TO US

01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:52.478
ON THAT. BUT SO THERE IS A BIT

01:55:52.545 --> 01:55:54.414
OF UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF OUR

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.815
CURRENT MCO TAX AND WHETHER OR

01:55:55.882 --> 01:55:58.351
NOT IT WILL BE GO THROUGH THE

01:55:58.418 --> 01:56:01.487
END OF 2026 AS APPROVED TODAY.

01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:03.656
GOT IT. AND AS IT CORRELATES TO

01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:05.491
OUR STATE BUDGET IN JANUARY,

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:07.360
AROUND THE CORNER WITH OUR NEW

01:56:07.427 --> 01:56:09.696
THE GOVERNOR PUTTING OUT HIS

01:56:09.762 --> 01:56:10.330
BUDGET PROPOSAL, IT'S JUST GOING

01:56:10.396 --> 01:56:12.398
TO BE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THEN

01:56:12.465 --> 01:56:14.100
BECAUSE WE. YES. SO WE'LL GO

01:56:14.167 --> 01:56:15.535
THROUGH ANOTHER CRAZY MAY

01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:17.770
REVISION NEXT NEXT YEAR. I MEAN

01:56:17.837 --> 01:56:19.572
IDEALLY WE WILL KNOW ABOUT THE

01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:21.074
TRANSITION PERIOD PRIOR TO

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:22.241
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE WILL

01:56:22.308 --> 01:56:24.243
HAVE REQUESTED IT. AND YOU KNOW,

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:26.045
KNOCK ON WOOD. AND SO BUT THAT

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:28.247
OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE THE

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:29.916
EXISTING MCO THROUGH THE

01:56:29.982 --> 01:56:31.784
APPROVED PERIOD. OKAY. AND THEN

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.186
ON THE RURAL HEALTH

01:56:33.252 --> 01:56:33.920
TRANSFORMATION FUND, I KNOW

01:56:33.986 --> 01:56:35.555
WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING YOUR

01:56:35.621 --> 01:56:36.956
SLIDE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:56:37.023 --> 01:56:37.557
SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR

01:56:37.623 --> 01:56:39.992
THOSE FUNDS. IT'S $50 BILLION

01:56:40.059 --> 01:56:41.994
TOTAL. HOW MUCH ARE WE GOING TO

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:44.063
BE ASKING FOR. WE DO NOT KNOW.

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:46.666
AT THIS POINT. THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:48.101
HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:49.502
INFORMATION, OR HCCI WILL BE

01:56:49.569 --> 01:56:50.903
ADMINISTERING THIS FUND. AND I

01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:52.238
KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:56:52.305 --> 01:56:53.473
CONVERSATIONS WITH CMS THAT ARE

01:56:53.539 --> 01:56:54.841
PLANNED IN THE COMING WEEKS TO

01:56:54.907 --> 01:56:56.209
GET MORE DETAILS ON THIS. DO WE

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:58.277
KNOW OF. BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE

01:56:58.344 --> 01:57:00.046
PAST WE'VE HAD SOME FUNDS LIKE

01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:01.147
THIS SIMILAR. DO WE KNOW IF THIS

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:02.749
IS GOING TO SUPPLEMENT OR

01:57:02.815 --> 01:57:04.317
SUPPLANT THE CURRENT FUNDING WE

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:06.853
HAVE FOR RURAL HOSPITALS? OR

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:08.221
MAYBE IT'S AN HCCI QUESTION.

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:10.056
YEAH. THE DISTRESS HOSPITAL LOAN

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.424
WITH STATE DOLLARS. THESE ARE

01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:12.759
NEW FEDERAL DOLLARS. I DON'T

01:57:12.825 --> 01:57:14.127
BELIEVE THERE ARE EXISTING

01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:15.995
FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR THIS

01:57:16.062 --> 01:57:17.964
PARTICULAR PURPOSE TODAY. BUT

01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:19.599
YEAH, I WOULD DEFINITELY DEFER

01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:21.534
TO MY COLLEAGUES AT HCCI AND

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:22.935
THEN, DIRECTOR, LAST QUESTION

01:57:23.002 --> 01:57:24.337
FOR YOU. WHAT PLATFORM EXIST OR

01:57:24.404 --> 01:57:25.872
ARE WE WORKING ON PLATFORM TO

01:57:25.938 --> 01:57:27.607
COLLECT CO-PAYMENTS, SINCE

01:57:27.673 --> 01:57:29.008
THAT'S GOING TO START IN A

01:57:29.075 --> 01:57:30.710
COUPLE YEARS? WE DON'T HAVE A

01:57:30.777 --> 01:57:31.577
PLATFORM TODAY. THAT IS

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:33.679
SOMETHING. AGAIN, IT STARTS

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:34.847
OCTOBER 2028 AND SO WE WILL BE

01:57:34.914 --> 01:57:36.416
WORKING TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING

01:57:36.482 --> 01:57:38.484
THAT IN THE COMING MONTHS. BUT

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:40.286
AGAIN, WORK REQUIREMENTS IN THE

01:57:40.353 --> 01:57:42.355
SEMIANNUAL REDETERMINATIONS ARE

01:57:42.422 --> 01:57:44.257
EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2027. SO JUST

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:46.058
A BIT SOONER. AND SO THAT'S KIND

01:57:46.125 --> 01:57:48.161
OF THE FOCUS RIGHT NOW FOR

01:57:48.227 --> 01:57:49.462
PLANNING OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:57:49.529 --> 01:57:51.063
ANGELA. YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW

01:57:51.130 --> 01:57:52.398
STATE INTERVENTION IS NEEDED.

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:55.435
YOU GAVE OUT A NUMBER OF A $305

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.904
MILLION IN FEDERAL FUND. WHAT

01:57:57.970 --> 01:57:58.805
DOES STATE INTERVENTION LOOK

01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:02.108
LIKE? I MEAN, I THINK IT IS IN

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:04.544
THE FORM OF FUNDING. CURRENTLY

01:58:04.610 --> 01:58:06.179
WE HAVE THE INJUNCTION. IF THE

01:58:06.245 --> 01:58:07.146
INJUNCTION IS OVERTURNED AND

01:58:07.213 --> 01:58:08.948
PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS DEFUNDED,

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:10.817
IT REALLY TURNS TO WORKING WITH

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:13.019
THE DEPARTMENT FOR HOW THOSE

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:14.454
CLAIMS CAN BE SUBMITTED, IF

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:15.788
THOSE CLAIMS CAN BE SUBMITTED,

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:18.024
AND HOW THOSE CLAIMS CAN BE

01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:20.660
REIMBURSED. I THINK MANY OF YOU

01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:22.161
ARE AWARE THAT A LOT OF THE

01:58:22.228 --> 01:58:23.296
PLANNED PARENTHOOD SERVICES, THE

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:25.198
FAMILY PLANNING AND STI SERVICE

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:26.966
TESTING SERVICES ARE AN ENHANCED

01:58:27.033 --> 01:58:29.135
FEDERAL MATCH, WHICH IS A 90%

01:58:29.202 --> 01:58:31.604
FEDERAL AND A 10% STATE FUNDING

01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:33.172
MATCH. SO WHEN PLANNED

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:34.106
PARENTHOOD IS FEDERALLY

01:58:34.173 --> 01:58:35.241
DEFUNDED, PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:39.545
NOT RECEIVING A 10% CLAIM

01:58:39.612 --> 01:58:41.447
REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES THAT

01:58:41.514 --> 01:58:42.515
HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. PLANNED

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:44.217
PARENTHOOD IS NOT RECEIVING

01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:46.486
REIMBURSEMENT AT ALL WITHOUT

01:58:46.552 --> 01:58:49.121
THOSE FMAP DOLLARS, SO IT'S

01:58:49.188 --> 01:58:50.356
GOING TO LOOK LIKE WORKING WITH

01:58:50.423 --> 01:58:52.258
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:58:52.325 --> 01:58:53.993
ADMINISTRATION TO IDENTIFY A

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:55.828
MEANS FOR THOSE DOLLARS TO BE

01:58:55.895 --> 01:58:58.297
PAID OUT FOR THE CLAIMS, AND IT

01:58:58.364 --> 01:59:00.266
WILL HAVE TO LOOK LIKE STATE

01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:03.002
ONLY DOLLARS. I MEAN, IS THERE A

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:04.937
SCENARIO WHERE WE CREATE I MEAN,

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:06.906
ARE WE LOOKING AT IT? I KNOW

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:08.541
IT'S ALL DEPENDENT ON THE

01:59:08.608 --> 01:59:09.909
DOLLARS, RIGHT? A STATE PROGRAM

01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:12.745
TO FUND THESE KIND OF

01:59:12.812 --> 01:59:14.280
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, GENDER

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:16.883
AFFIRMING CARE, HEALTH INSURANCE

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:19.018
FOR THE UAS POPULATION? I MEAN,

01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:21.387
I THINK THESE ARE ALL OPTIONS

01:59:21.454 --> 01:59:22.021
THAT ARE PART OF THE DISCUSSION.

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:23.589
WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:25.057
WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD, JUST

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:26.526
THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE LAST

01:59:26.592 --> 01:59:27.793
FEW WEEKS OF ITS DEFUNDED. WE

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:29.028
HAVE AN INJUNCTION. AND SO

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:30.396
REALLY TRYING TO THINK THROUGH

01:59:30.463 --> 01:59:31.464
OPTIONS TO ENSURE SERVICES ARE

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:33.933
STILL AVAILABLE. THANK YOU. AND

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.368
ADAM, YOU GAVE US SOME NUMBERS.

01:59:35.434 --> 01:59:36.802
SO WHAT DOES THAT REVENUE LOSS

01:59:36.869 --> 01:59:39.472
TRANSLATE TO IN YOUR HOSPITALS.

01:59:39.539 --> 01:59:42.308
WE THINK IT'S A IT'S ABOUT 14 TO

01:59:42.375 --> 01:59:44.510
30% OF TOTAL MEDI-CAL. LET ME

01:59:44.577 --> 01:59:45.912
REPHRASE MY QUESTION I GOT THOSE

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:49.715
NUMBERS. WHAT DOES FOR SERVICE.

01:59:49.782 --> 01:59:50.216
WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY

01:59:50.283 --> 01:59:51.684
TRANSLATE TO. WHAT DOES THAT

01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:53.986
LOOK LIKE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR

01:59:54.053 --> 01:59:57.156
SOME HOSPITALS IT'S PROBABLY TOO

01:59:57.223 --> 01:59:58.424
LARGE OF A GAP FOR SOME

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:00.459
HOSPITALS TO REMAIN OPEN. SHOULD

02:00:00.526 --> 02:00:03.462
ALL OF THESE CUTS BE EFFECTUATED

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:05.398
THE WAY THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY

02:00:05.464 --> 02:00:07.466
ANTICIPATED? WITHOUT RADICAL

02:00:07.533 --> 02:00:09.936
CHANGES IN SOME OTHER FACTORS

02:00:10.002 --> 02:00:11.504
THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL

02:00:11.571 --> 02:00:12.505
STILL GOING TO HAVE TO

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:14.273
COLLECTIVELY THINK THROUGH. AND

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.641
I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION,

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:17.476
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS A

02:00:17.543 --> 02:00:18.978
STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND

02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:20.646
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:00:20.713 --> 02:00:22.281
PROCEED FORWARD IN A WORLD WHERE

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:24.050
THERE'S LESS DOLLARS, AND IN A

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:25.084
WORLD WHERE THERE'S LESS

02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:27.587
DOLLARS, LESS DOLLARS, HOW DO WE

02:00:27.653 --> 02:00:29.956
GET THE ALLOTTED DOLLARS TO

02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:32.391
C.H.A? OR, I MEAN, NOT TO THE

02:00:32.458 --> 02:00:33.192
HOSPITALS, TO YOUR MEMBERS? HOW

02:00:33.259 --> 02:00:35.595
DO WE STREAMLINE OR MAKE IT

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:38.130
EASIER FOR YOU TO GET THE

02:00:38.197 --> 02:00:39.231
DOLLARS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO GET

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:41.667
DURING THIS TIME, OR IS THINKING

02:00:41.734 --> 02:00:43.803
ABOUT REGULATIONS, ANYTHING THAT

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:45.871
WE CAN STREAMLINE TO PROTECT THE

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:47.573
DOLLARS THAT WE DO HAVE? YEAH,

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:50.242
YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.

02:00:50.309 --> 02:00:51.877
I THINK THAT. SO SELF FINANCING

02:00:51.944 --> 02:00:52.912
HAS BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT

02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:55.781
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A WAY TO

02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:58.250
BENEFIT THE ACCESS TO THE

02:00:58.317 --> 02:01:00.786
SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED WITHOUT

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:02.088
PUTTING UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE

02:01:02.154 --> 02:01:05.358
STATE GENERAL FUND. AND, YOU

02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:07.259
KNOW, AND IT ALLOWS FOR A MORE

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:09.362
SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM. SO WE NEED

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:11.130
TO LOOK AT WAYS IN WHICH THAT

02:01:11.197 --> 02:01:12.965
SYSTEM CAN BE IMPROVED TO FIT

02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:14.734
WITHIN THE CURRENT FEDERAL

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.235
REGULATORY STRUCTURE. THE OTHER

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:18.104
THING THAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE

02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:20.172
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HEALTHCARE

02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:21.140
DELIVERY, AND ARE THERE WAYS

02:01:21.207 --> 02:01:23.009
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT OPERATIONS

02:01:23.075 --> 02:01:25.011
TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS HUMANLY

02:01:25.077 --> 02:01:26.145
POSSIBLE? AND THEN THE OTHER

02:01:26.212 --> 02:01:27.346
THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:29.982
TO LOOK AT, AND THIS IS KIND OF

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:30.950
A LARGER COLLECTIVE CONVERSATION

02:01:31.017 --> 02:01:32.284
THAT'S GOING TO BE A MULTIYEAR

02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:34.654
CONVERSATION IS AROUND ARE THERE

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:37.189
RULES IN THE STATE THAT ARE GOOD

02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:38.858
IDEAS AND SOLVE CERTAIN

02:01:38.924 --> 02:01:40.526
PROBLEMS? BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD

02:01:40.593 --> 02:01:42.862
RIGHT NOW IF WE WANT TO HAVE

02:01:42.928 --> 02:01:44.964
HOSPITALS REMAIN OPEN? ARE THERE

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:46.766
IS THERE REGULATORY RELIEF? ARE

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:49.301
THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ON

02:01:49.368 --> 02:01:50.403
THAT FRONT THAT ALLOW HOSPITALS

02:01:50.469 --> 02:01:52.004
TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN WHILE

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:53.072
WE'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:54.874
DIFFICULT PERIOD? THANK YOU.

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.409
AND, LINDA, MY LAST QUESTION TO

02:01:56.475 --> 02:01:58.744
YOU, AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY

02:01:58.811 --> 02:02:00.012
CO-CHAIR HERE. HOW DO WE MAKE

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:01.614
SURE THAT OUR CONSUMERS DON'T

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:03.816
LOSE MEDI-CAL OR ACCESS TO

02:02:03.883 --> 02:02:04.950
HEALTH HEALTH INSURANCE OR

02:02:05.017 --> 02:02:07.486
ACCESS TO HEALTH? GREAT

02:02:07.553 --> 02:02:08.788
QUESTION. THESE ARE MASSIVE

02:02:08.854 --> 02:02:12.058
CHANGES. I LIKEN IT TO ACA

02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:13.359
IMPLEMENTATION WHERE THAT TOOK

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:15.227
YEARS OF PLANNING. AND SO DO

02:02:15.294 --> 02:02:16.328
APPRECIATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:02:16.395 --> 02:02:18.964
IS ENGAGING US EARLY. WE KNOW

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:20.900
THAT DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE AS

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:23.502
WE SPEAK FOR, BECAUSE THESE

02:02:23.569 --> 02:02:26.372
SYSTEM CHANGES WILL TAKE TIME.

02:02:26.439 --> 02:02:28.841
BUT WE ALSO KNOW FROM PAST

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:30.009
EXPERIENCE LESSONS LEARNED FROM

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:33.279
FROM UNWINDING THAT THERE THAT

02:02:33.345 --> 02:02:35.114
THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES THAT

02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:41.487
THAT COUNTIES HAD DIFFICULTIES.

02:02:41.554 --> 02:02:44.056
GOING THROUGH UNWINDING FOR. AND

02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:46.726
SO TO HAVE TO DO TWICE THE

02:02:46.792 --> 02:02:49.495
NUMBER OF REDETERMINATIONS CHECK

02:02:49.562 --> 02:02:51.230
ON WORK REQUIREMENTS. THESE ARE

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:52.998
MASSIVE UNDERTAKINGS. AND SO

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:54.767
MAKING SURE THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE

02:02:54.834 --> 02:02:56.702
READY, BUT ALSO THAT THE

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:57.737
COMMUNICATION HAPPENS, THE

02:02:57.803 --> 02:03:00.272
OUTREACH HAPPENS TO THE

02:03:00.339 --> 02:03:01.974
COMMUNITY, BUT THAT THAT

02:03:02.041 --> 02:03:03.142
COMMUNITIES CAN SPEAK TO THE

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:04.910
COUNTIES FROM SOME OF THE

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:06.345
LESSONS LEARNED THAT THERE. I

02:03:06.412 --> 02:03:09.582
THINK TO YOUR QUESTION OF THE

02:03:09.648 --> 02:03:12.518
SYSTEMS IN PLACE, WE KNOW THAT

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:14.220
PEOPLE TRIED TO REACH OUT

02:03:14.286 --> 02:03:15.020
THROUGH CAL. HERE'S BENEFITS

02:03:15.087 --> 02:03:18.958
CAL. THESE ARE STATEWIDE SYSTEMS

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:21.360
THAT THAT HAD CHALLENGES THERE.

02:03:21.427 --> 02:03:23.229
AND SO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE AS

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:26.098
PREPARED AS POSSIBLE. BUT DO

02:03:26.165 --> 02:03:28.667
EXPECT THAT REGARDLESS OF THE

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:31.470
PREPARATION, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:33.706
THAT THERE WILL BE COVERAGE

02:03:33.773 --> 02:03:37.109
LOSSES AND NO NEED FOR AN ANSWER

02:03:37.176 --> 02:03:38.244
HERE, JUST TO LEAVE WITH A

02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:40.346
THOUGHT FOR YOU AND THE OTHER

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:41.647
ADVOCATE GROUPS. I DON'T

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:43.816
REMEMBER WHAT PRE ACA LOOKED

02:03:43.883 --> 02:03:46.719
LIKE OR I JUST I JUST DON'T

02:03:46.786 --> 02:03:48.420
REMEMBER. YOU KNOW, SO I'M

02:03:48.487 --> 02:03:50.656
TRYING TO THINK WHAT PROGRAMS

02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:52.458
PROGRAMS EXISTED AT THAT TIME TO

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:54.126
TRY TO CLOSE THE GAP WHEN WE HAD

02:03:54.193 --> 02:03:56.162
DOUBLE DIGITS OF OR PERCENTAGE

02:03:56.228 --> 02:03:58.230
IN UNINSURED POPULATION IN

02:03:58.297 --> 02:03:59.064
CALIFORNIA. ARE WE LOOKING AT

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:01.066
THAT TO BRING THOSE BACK THAT

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:02.835
ARE THAT CAN HELP COVER THIS

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:04.703
GAP, BUT JUST WOULD LOVE TO

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:06.105
CONTINUE WITH ADVOCATES ON THAT

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:07.840
CONVERSATION OF WHAT WE DID THEN

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:10.309
TO TRY TO CLOSE THAT GAP THAT

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:11.477
MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT NOW, MADAM

02:04:11.544 --> 02:04:14.413
CHAIR, THANK YOU. AND THANKS SO

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.482
MUCH FOR THIS INCREDIBLY

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:18.350
INFORMATIVE PANEL. ONE OF THE

02:04:18.417 --> 02:04:20.119
THINGS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO

02:04:20.186 --> 02:04:21.887
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT

02:04:21.954 --> 02:04:24.890
NOW IS TO ONE JUST KIND OF PUSH

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:26.425
BACK ON SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS

02:04:26.492 --> 02:04:29.161
THAT ARE BUILT INTO H.R. ONE, IN

02:04:29.228 --> 02:04:30.529
TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON OUR

02:04:30.596 --> 02:04:31.697
OVERALL HEALTH CARE, AND THE

02:04:31.764 --> 02:04:34.333
OTHER IS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.068
KIND OF ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:37.203
IMMEDIATELY GET TO WORK IN TERMS

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:39.171
OF THE HARM MITIGATION EFFORTS

02:04:39.238 --> 02:04:41.106
THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO

02:04:41.173 --> 02:04:42.441
ENGAGE IN TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE

02:04:42.508 --> 02:04:44.176
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:46.712
LOSS IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE

02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:47.379
THAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO EXIST.

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:49.715
SO PART OF MY QUESTIONS, SEVERAL

02:04:49.782 --> 02:04:51.116
OF MY QUESTIONS WILL REVOLVE

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:53.352
AROUND THAT. THE FIRST IS WITH

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:55.721
THE WORK REQUIREMENTS AND

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:56.722
PARTICULARLY THE ELIGIBILITY

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:58.924
CHECKS THAT ARE BUILT INTO H.R.

02:04:58.991 --> 02:05:01.227
ONE. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER

02:05:01.293 --> 02:05:03.062
STATES I KNOW, AND HOPEFULLY YOU

02:05:03.128 --> 02:05:06.498
CAN SHARE THAT HAVE DONE THIS

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:08.834
ALREADY. GEORGIA, FOR INSTANCE,

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:10.269
AROUND WORK REQUIREMENTS, DO YOU

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:13.339
ALL HAVE A SENSE OF THE.

02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:16.609
PRECIPITOUS OF THE IMPACT OR THE

02:05:16.675 --> 02:05:20.279
KIND OF THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF,

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:22.047
FROM A TIMING PERSPECTIVE OF THE

02:05:22.114 --> 02:05:25.251
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO KIND OF

02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:27.219
FELL OFF OF HEALTH CARE OR KIND

02:05:27.286 --> 02:05:29.588
OF OFF OF THE CLIFF. IF YOU TOOK

02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:31.190
GEORGIA, FOR INSTANCE, THAT HAD

02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:35.628
WORK REQUIREMENTS, I'LL JUMP IN

02:05:35.694 --> 02:05:38.264
HERE. WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE WAS

02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:42.568
A 77, UP TO 77% PROCEDURAL

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:44.403
TERMINATIONS FOR, FOR, FOR, FOR

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:46.105
THESE STATES THAT DID IT THROUGH

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:49.909
A MANUAL PROCESS. AND SO THAT

02:05:49.975 --> 02:05:52.044
THAT IS A SHOCKINGLY HIGH NUMBER

02:05:52.111 --> 02:05:53.712
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING

02:05:53.779 --> 02:05:55.080
TERMINATED JUST FOR PAPERWORK

02:05:55.147 --> 02:05:57.149
REASONS, NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE

02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:59.518
THEY'RE NOT WORKING AS AS SHARON

02:05:59.585 --> 02:06:01.787
SHARED EARLIER, MANY OF THE

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:03.722
PEOPLE ON MEDI-CAL, MEDICAID ARE

02:06:03.789 --> 02:06:06.992
WORKING. AND SO WE SO THESE ARE

02:06:07.059 --> 02:06:09.261
THESE ARE REALLY ADMINISTRATIVE

02:06:09.328 --> 02:06:11.730
BURDENS. AND SO I THINK

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.899
AUTOMATING IT WILL HELP REDUCE

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:16.802
THAT, AUTOMATE AUTOMATING THE

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:20.739
EXEMPTIONS EVERYTHING THE

02:06:20.806 --> 02:06:22.207
DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT. BUT BUT

02:06:22.274 --> 02:06:24.410
THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME. AND

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:26.011
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF HOW

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:29.448
OLD SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE, I

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:31.984
THINK THE PLANNING HAS TO HAPPEN

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:33.619
NOW. I THINK SENATOR WEBBER WILL

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:34.787
ATTEST, AND EVEN THE CHAIR FROM

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:36.088
BUDGET SUBHEALTH OUR

02:06:36.155 --> 02:06:37.323
CONVERSATIONS AND OUR IT

02:06:37.389 --> 02:06:38.357
PROGRAMS. RIGHT, DIRECTOR, WE

02:06:38.424 --> 02:06:39.858
ARE NOT GOOD WITH OUR IT

02:06:39.925 --> 02:06:46.198
PROGRAMS HERE. SO YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:06:46.265 --> 02:06:47.700
WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:48.734
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR

02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:50.602
COLLEAGUES IN IN GEORGIA,

02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:53.872
TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS AND JUST

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:55.407
KIND OF REITERATING, I THINK

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:57.009
THAT SOME OF THE COMPLICATIONS

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:58.177
THAT HAVE BEEN FACED IN ALL OF

02:06:58.243 --> 02:06:59.979
THOSE STATES, WHEN EITHER

02:07:00.045 --> 02:07:01.347
STANDING UP OR EVEN ATTEMPTING

02:07:01.413 --> 02:07:02.815
TO STAND UP, SOME OF THESE

02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:05.617
PROGRAMS HAVE NOT BEEN EASY. AND

02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:09.755
SO APOLOGIZE TO DIRECTOR BOSS

02:07:09.822 --> 02:07:11.790
FOR HAVING TO BE FACED WITH WITH

02:07:11.857 --> 02:07:14.660
IMPLEMENTING THIS AND, YOU KNOW,

02:07:14.727 --> 02:07:16.028
STAND READY TO HELP IN ANY WAY

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:18.197
THAT WE CAN. AND I THINK THE

02:07:18.263 --> 02:07:19.798
DIRECTED TOWARDS DIRECTOR BOSS.

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:21.867
SO THE IDEA OF THE WORK

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:23.035
REQUIREMENTS, ELIGIBILITY

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:24.436
CHECKS, THE WHAT WE'VE JUST

02:07:24.503 --> 02:07:26.605
ESTABLISHED IS GOING TO BE AN

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:28.040
INCREDIBLY HEAVY LIFT IN TERMS

02:07:28.107 --> 02:07:29.475
OF MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DO

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:31.910
THAT. WE DO HAVE IN THE STATE OF

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:34.880
CALIFORNIA WITH OUR LAST BUDGET

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:37.483
IN PLACE, SOME WELL, NOT A

02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:40.085
COMPONENT OF THOSE PIECES. WHAT

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:42.554
IS THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN OUR

02:07:42.621 --> 02:07:45.290
NEED TO BE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:49.294
NEW ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS AND WHAT

02:07:49.361 --> 02:07:51.397
IT WILL TAKE FOR US AND THE

02:07:51.463 --> 02:07:52.798
FEDERAL FUNDING REPAYMENT

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:56.735
PENALTY STRUCTURE? SO IS THERE A

02:07:56.802 --> 02:08:00.139
CHANCE WHERE CALIFORNIA WILL

02:08:00.205 --> 02:08:02.608
NOT, BEING THE LARGEST PROVIDER

02:08:02.674 --> 02:08:05.144
OF MEDI-CAL SERVICES OR MEDICAID

02:08:05.210 --> 02:08:08.347
SERVICES, WILL BASICALLY BE IN A

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:09.381
POSITION WHERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:12.251
ABLE TO STAND UP THE SYSTEMS

02:08:12.317 --> 02:08:15.187
THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO DO THIS,

02:08:15.254 --> 02:08:17.756
WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES

02:08:17.823 --> 02:08:19.958
WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:08:20.025 --> 02:08:21.193
SYSTEMATIZE THIS IN A MANNER

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.062
THAT IS EFFECTIVE, AND THEN

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:25.998
BEING FACED WITH THESE FUNDING

02:08:26.065 --> 02:08:30.669
PENALTIES. AGREE THE PERM RATE

02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:32.504
CHANGE, THE ABILITY TO WAIVE THE

02:08:32.571 --> 02:08:33.872
FLEXIBILITIES IF WE WERE MAKING

02:08:33.939 --> 02:08:35.707
KIND OF CORRECTIVE ACTION OR

02:08:35.774 --> 02:08:36.809
WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOES INTO

02:08:36.875 --> 02:08:38.377
EFFECT AT THE END OF 2029. BUT

02:08:38.444 --> 02:08:40.145
THE INTERPLAY OF ALL OF THESE

02:08:40.212 --> 02:08:41.380
CHANGES TOGETHER IS SOMETHING

02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:43.015
THAT WE ARE THINKING THROUGH. I

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:44.650
DON'T HAVE A RESPONSE FOR YOU IN

02:08:44.716 --> 02:08:47.152
TERMS OF WHAT DOES X MEAN FOR Y,

02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:48.720
BUT WE ARE THINKING THROUGH HOW

02:08:48.787 --> 02:08:50.789
ALL OF THESE INTERACT AND HOW

02:08:50.856 --> 02:08:52.658
TO, AGAIN, AS WE'VE ALL

02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:53.859
DISCUSSED, REALLY AUTOMATE SOME

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.994
OF THESE PROCESSES TO TAKE KIND

02:08:56.061 --> 02:08:56.995
OF THE MANUAL PROCESS OUT, TO

02:08:57.062 --> 02:08:58.831
TAKE THE PROCEDURAL PROCESS OUT

02:08:58.897 --> 02:09:00.766
OF THESE DETERMINATIONS, TO MAKE

02:09:00.833 --> 02:09:03.235
THEM AS SIMPLE FOR NOT JUST OUR

02:09:03.302 --> 02:09:04.069
MEMBERS, OUR COUNTY ELIGIBILITY,

02:09:04.136 --> 02:09:05.704
OUR COMMUNITY BASED

02:09:05.771 --> 02:09:06.472
ORGANIZATIONS WHO ASSIST WITH

02:09:06.538 --> 02:09:08.507
THIS PROCESS. I JUST WANT US TO

02:09:08.574 --> 02:09:10.642
KIND OF HOLD HOW INCREDIBLY

02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:13.145
INSIDIOUS AND QUITE FRANKLY,

02:09:13.212 --> 02:09:16.482
EVIL THESE THE COMPONENTS OF

02:09:16.548 --> 02:09:18.617
H.R. ONE ARE, BECAUSE ON THE ONE

02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:20.018
HAND, WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD A

02:09:20.085 --> 02:09:21.687
WORK REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD

02:09:21.753 --> 02:09:23.255
LEAD TO OR DIFFERENT KIND OF

02:09:23.322 --> 02:09:24.423
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:26.492
WOULD LEAD TO 70 CENT, YOU KNOW,

02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:29.995
AN EXAMPLE, 70, 77% OF PEOPLE

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:32.498
FOR GEORGIA LOSING HEALTH CARE

02:09:32.564 --> 02:09:34.800
COVERAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:36.602
PUTTING IN A MECHANISM IN H.R.

02:09:36.668 --> 02:09:37.936
ONE THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:39.538
TICKING TIME BOMB IN TERMS OF

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:40.906
OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

02:09:40.973 --> 02:09:42.708
RECEIVE ANY FEDERAL FUNDING. SO

02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:44.543
IT'S A FUNCTIONAL DEFUNDING OF

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:46.945
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN IN THE

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:48.780
ENTIRETY THAT IS AT STAKE BY THE

02:09:48.847 --> 02:09:51.116
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT IS

02:09:51.183 --> 02:09:53.152
A HEAVY WEIGHT TO CARRY. AND WE

02:09:53.218 --> 02:09:54.520
HAVE AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF THAT

02:09:54.586 --> 02:09:56.822
WITH THE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:09:56.889 --> 02:09:58.857
TAKEN AGAINST PLANNED PARENTHOOD

02:09:58.924 --> 02:10:03.295
IN IN H.R. ONE. AND I WANTED TO

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:06.899
JUST HIT ON ANGELA. YOU, YOU YOU

02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:12.771
SPOKE TO THE IMMEDIATE CLOSURES

02:10:12.838 --> 02:10:15.407
THAT WILL HAPPEN WITH NEARLY

02:10:15.474 --> 02:10:18.377
PROBABLY 22,000 PEOPLE A WEEK

02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:19.978
RECEIVING COVERAGE, NEEDING TO

02:10:20.045 --> 02:10:22.648
BE ABSORBED BY OUR MEDI-CAL

02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:27.686
SYSTEM, WHICH IS. INCREDIBLY

02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:28.854
ALARMING. WE KNOW THAT THAT HAS

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:31.623
AN IMPACT NOT ONLY ON PLANNED

02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:33.525
PARENTHOOD, OBVIOUSLY, BUT IT

02:10:33.592 --> 02:10:35.027
ALSO HAS AN IMPACT ON OUR OTHER

02:10:35.093 --> 02:10:37.129
HEALTH CLINICS, OUR FQHCS OR

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:37.963
COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINICS AS

02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:40.065
WELL. WHO WOULD WOULD BE FACING

02:10:40.132 --> 02:10:42.901
THIS KIND OF ISSUE AS WELL? DO

02:10:42.968 --> 02:10:47.506
YOU ALL HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT

02:10:47.573 --> 02:10:50.075
KIND OF, AGAIN, JUST FROM A TIME

02:10:50.142 --> 02:10:52.211
PERSPECTIVE, RUNWAY, WE ARE

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:54.112
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE

02:10:54.179 --> 02:10:56.882
NOT BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE BASIC

02:10:56.949 --> 02:11:00.052
HEALTH CARE. I APPRECIATE THE

02:11:00.118 --> 02:11:02.487
QUESTION. I THINK IT'S ALSO

02:11:02.554 --> 02:11:04.089
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT IN

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.057
TERMS OF THE HEALTH CENTERS AND

02:11:05.123 --> 02:11:06.725
WHAT THE HEALTH CENTERS ARE

02:11:06.792 --> 02:11:08.293
PROVIDING. THIS IS REALLY WHAT

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:09.294
THE PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS

02:11:09.361 --> 02:11:10.929
AND WHAT PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO

02:11:10.996 --> 02:11:12.531
RECEIVE. AND THAT'S WHAT PLANNED

02:11:12.598 --> 02:11:13.532
PARENTHOOD PROVIDES. PLANNED

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:15.867
PARENTHOOD OPERATES IN LOCATIONS

02:11:15.934 --> 02:11:17.002
INTENTIONALLY, WHERE IT MAY BE

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:19.471
MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS

02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:21.306
HEALTHCARE. IN TERMS OF THE

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:23.442
TIMELINE, IT'S HARD TO SAY. WHAT

02:11:23.508 --> 02:11:27.479
I CAN SAY IS THAT THESE ARE REAL

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:30.749
OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR STAFF,

02:11:30.816 --> 02:11:32.584
OPERATIONS, SERVICES PROVIDED,

02:11:32.651 --> 02:11:34.319
KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON, PAYING

02:11:34.386 --> 02:11:37.322
RENT, AND SOME. I APPRECIATED

02:11:37.389 --> 02:11:38.890
SOMEONE MENTIONING HARM

02:11:38.957 --> 02:11:40.392
REDUCTION. I THINK FOR THE

02:11:40.459 --> 02:11:42.160
AFFILIATES IT'S REALLY FORWARD

02:11:42.227 --> 02:11:43.595
LOOKING. AND WHILE WE ARE

02:11:43.662 --> 02:11:45.063
CURRENTLY UNDER AN INJUNCTION,

02:11:45.130 --> 02:11:47.699
THERE'S NO TIME FRAME THAT WE

02:11:47.766 --> 02:11:50.369
MAY OR MAY NOT MAINTAIN. THAT

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:53.672
AND AN OVERNIGHT DEFUNDING

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:55.907
FEDERALLY CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:11:55.974 --> 02:11:58.377
IMPACTS VERY QUICKLY, AS WE'VE

02:11:58.443 --> 02:12:01.280
WITNESSED. SO WE CAN'T SAY THAT

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:02.981
ANY AFFILIATE HAS A CERTAIN

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:04.616
AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO

02:12:04.683 --> 02:12:06.218
BE ABLE TO STAY OPEN WITHOUT

02:12:06.285 --> 02:12:07.753
RECEIVING REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ANY

02:12:07.819 --> 02:12:09.688
AMOUNT OF TIME. BUT I DO THINK

02:12:09.755 --> 02:12:12.424
THAT THE AFFILIATES ARE LOOKING

02:12:12.491 --> 02:12:14.660
FOR SOME SORTS OF ASSURANCES

02:12:14.726 --> 02:12:16.261
THAT THERE WILL BE FUNDING

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:17.296
AVAILABLE, AND THAT THEIR CLAIMS

02:12:17.362 --> 02:12:19.531
WILL BE ABLE TO BE SUBMITTED AND

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:21.366
BE REIMBURSED. LOOKING FORWARD

02:12:21.433 --> 02:12:23.568
AS THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS EVEN

02:12:23.635 --> 02:12:25.837
TODAY, IN TERMS OF SERVICES

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:28.940
PROVIDED, OPERATIONS AND ETC, I

02:12:29.007 --> 02:12:30.709
APPRECIATE THAT. AND I'LL ASK

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.377
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME QUESTION OF

02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:35.080
ADAM FROM CHAR'S PERSPECTIVE,

02:12:35.147 --> 02:12:37.282
THE KIND OF SCENARIO PLANNING

02:12:37.349 --> 02:12:38.984
THAT YOUR ARE, YOUR HOSPITAL

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:40.819
MEMBERS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW,

02:12:40.886 --> 02:12:42.654
GIVEN THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF

02:12:42.721 --> 02:12:44.022
H.R. ONE, THE REDUCTION OF THE

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:47.092
MCO TAX, THE FMAP, AND ALL OF

02:12:47.159 --> 02:12:49.261
THE WAYS IN WHICH WE KNOW THE

02:12:49.328 --> 02:12:50.896
REVENUE REDUCTION IS GOING TO BE

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:54.066
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. ARE YOU

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:55.500
HEARING FROM YOUR HOSPITALS? I

02:12:55.567 --> 02:12:57.135
KNOW THAT WE ARE HEARING A LOT

02:12:57.202 --> 02:12:58.470
AS WELL, BUT CAN YOU JUST

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:00.706
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL COLOR ON

02:13:00.772 --> 02:13:03.909
THE KINDS OF DECISIONS THAT OUR

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.977
HOSPITALS ARE LOOKING TO MAKE

02:13:06.044 --> 02:13:09.681
AND THE TIMING IN WHICH THEY ARE

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:12.617
SEEKING TO HAVE SOME KIND OF

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:13.618
RESOLUTION TO BE ABLE TO

02:13:13.685 --> 02:13:15.420
IMPLEMENT THAT YOU CAN'T CLOSE

02:13:15.487 --> 02:13:19.324
HOSPITAL OVERNIGHT. YEAH. SO AS

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:22.627
YOU CAN IMAGINE, MUCH LIKE THIS

02:13:22.694 --> 02:13:24.162
CONVERSATION, I THINK THAT THE

02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:27.866
MOOD IS DOUR. YOU KNOW, THERE'S

02:13:27.933 --> 02:13:29.401
NOT A LOT OF OPTIMISM AT THE

02:13:29.468 --> 02:13:34.439
MOMENT THERE, I THINK THAT WHAT

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:36.308
THERE'S WHAT WHAT HOSPITALS ARE

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:39.277
GENERALLY DOING IS DOING SOME

02:13:39.344 --> 02:13:43.582
MULTIYEAR FISCAL PLANNING AND

02:13:43.648 --> 02:13:44.716
PLANNING. WHAT CAN OPERATIONS

02:13:44.783 --> 02:13:48.086
LOOK LIKE WITH FEWER DOLLARS?

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:50.455
AND FOR SOME HOSPITALS, I THINK

02:13:50.522 --> 02:13:52.190
THAT A PATH TO REMAINING OPEN IS

02:13:52.257 --> 02:13:54.693
REALLY CHALLENGING FOR SOME

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.895
HOSPITALS, YOU KNOW, A PATH TO

02:13:56.962 --> 02:13:58.764
MAINTAINING ALL OF THE SERVICES

02:13:58.830 --> 02:13:59.364
THAT YOU CURRENTLY PROVIDE IS

02:13:59.431 --> 02:14:03.602
NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE. AND

02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:05.437
FOR AND FOR OTHERS, I THINK IT'S

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:07.939
JUST A QUESTION OF, YOU KNOW,

02:14:08.006 --> 02:14:10.442
ARE THERE OTHER WAYS TO, YOU

02:14:10.509 --> 02:14:12.978
KNOW, DO OPERATIONS AND, YOU

02:14:13.044 --> 02:14:14.980
KNOW, KEEP EVERYONE EMPLOYED

02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:17.315
THAT YOU'VE GOT ON STAFF OR IS

02:14:17.382 --> 02:14:18.216
THAT ALL POSSIBLE UNDER KIND OF

02:14:18.283 --> 02:14:21.219
YOUR YOUR LONG TERM AND MID-TERM

02:14:21.286 --> 02:14:23.021
PLANNING, WHEN YOU KNOW THAT

02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:23.889
THERE'S GOING TO BE FEWER

02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:26.057
DOLLARS COMING IN AND FRANKLY,

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:27.559
THE SAME AMOUNT OF PATIENTS

02:14:27.626 --> 02:14:29.161
BECAUSE THE PATIENTS ARE STILL

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:30.729
GOING TO SHOW UP IN THOSE

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:32.531
EMERGENCY ROOMS AND IT'S YOU

02:14:32.597 --> 02:14:35.033
JUST DON'T HAVE THE DOLLARS

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:37.602
COMING IN THE DOOR TO, TO HELP

02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:38.203
PAY FOR THE CARE. YEAH. AND I

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:40.572
KNOW THAT WE ARE WE'RE ALREADY

02:14:40.639 --> 02:14:41.373
IN A SITUATION WHERE HOSPITALS

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.941
WERE HAVING TO ASK SOME VERSION

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:44.342
OF THOSE QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF

02:14:44.409 --> 02:14:45.744
THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT THEY

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:47.245
ARE ABLE TO KEEP OPEN. SENATOR

02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:49.014
WEBER PEARSON, I ACTUALLY THINK

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.849
ALL OF THE MEMBERS, SENATOR

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:52.184
MENGIBAR AND I AS WELL, HAVE

02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:53.985
BEEN LOOKING AND SENATOR

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:55.387
RICHARDSON ACTUALLY TO HAVE BEEN

02:14:55.454 --> 02:14:56.588
LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT, FOR

02:14:56.655 --> 02:14:57.923
INSTANCE, KIND OF LABOR AND

02:14:57.989 --> 02:15:01.593
DELIVERY FUNCTIONS AND, AND THE

02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:02.994
FACT THAT THEY'RE CLOSING AT A

02:15:03.061 --> 02:15:04.496
PRETTY PRECIPITOUS RATE RIGHT

02:15:04.563 --> 02:15:06.865
NOW BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:09.935
CHALLENGING COST CENTERS TO

02:15:10.001 --> 02:15:13.104
PROVIDE CARE. I, I THINK IT

02:15:13.171 --> 02:15:15.006
WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO MOVE

02:15:15.073 --> 02:15:17.876
INTO A SPACE WHERE WE ARE

02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:19.177
ENGAGING IN THAT SCENARIO,

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:21.012
PLANNING TOGETHER OVER THE

02:15:21.079 --> 02:15:22.147
COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL

02:15:22.214 --> 02:15:24.316
MONTHS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND,

02:15:24.382 --> 02:15:25.684
FROM THE HOSPITAL'S PERSPECTIVE,

02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:27.052
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES

02:15:27.118 --> 02:15:31.456
PERSPECTIVE WHAT THE MAP IS FOR,

02:15:31.523 --> 02:15:33.625
WHAT WILL NEED TO CLOSE WHEN

02:15:33.692 --> 02:15:36.127
IT'S GOING TO HAVE SERIOUS

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.696
REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS

02:15:37.762 --> 02:15:41.533
OF THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO CARE.

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.969
AND I THINK WORK THAT WE ALL

02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:45.203
NEED TO DO, OBVIOUSLY, WITH

02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:48.139
DIRECTOR BASS AND. AND ALL OF

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:49.708
OUR AGENCIES ENGAGED IN THIS

02:15:49.774 --> 02:15:53.845
WORK, IT IS ALSO JUST I WANT TO

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:56.014
BECAUSE IT'S HARD NOT TO GET

02:15:56.081 --> 02:15:59.117
ANGRY AT THIS, THIS, THIS $50

02:15:59.184 --> 02:16:01.319
BILLION RURAL HEALTH

02:16:01.386 --> 02:16:03.455
TRANSFORMATION FUND FOR THE

02:16:03.522 --> 02:16:06.358
NATION. CALIFORNIA MAY RECEIVE

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:13.532
SOME PORTION OF THAT. CAN YOU

02:16:13.598 --> 02:16:17.202
ALL PUT INTO CONTEXT FOR US,

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:19.204
EITHER DIRECTOR BASS OR OR I

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:22.173
THINK PLANNED PARENTHOOD OR OR

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.776
TO KIND OF GIVE US A SENSE OF,

02:16:24.843 --> 02:16:28.313
OF THE OPERATING REVENUE THAT IS

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:31.816
REQUIRED TO KEEP ONE RURAL

02:16:31.883 --> 02:16:36.221
HOSPITAL OPEN THAT MIGHT BE

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:39.824
STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. THAT

02:16:39.891 --> 02:16:42.327
REALLY THAT DEPENDS. I HAD A

02:16:42.394 --> 02:16:43.962
COLLEAGUE WHO WOULD SAY, YOU'VE

02:16:44.029 --> 02:16:45.096
SEEN ONE HOSPITAL, YOU'VE SEEN

02:16:45.163 --> 02:16:47.732
ONE HOSPITAL, AND LET'S TAKE ONE

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:49.301
OF THE ONES THAT ARE ON OUR

02:16:49.367 --> 02:16:50.735
DISTRESSED HOSPITAL LIST.

02:16:50.802 --> 02:16:53.672
MADERA. YEAH. YEAH. I MEAN, SOME

02:16:53.738 --> 02:16:55.707
OF THOSE HOSPITALS, YOU KNOW, SO

02:16:55.774 --> 02:16:57.409
WE HAD A, YOU KNOW, A PARTIAL

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:58.977
CLOSURE, YOU KNOW, RECENTLY DOWN

02:16:59.044 --> 02:17:01.346
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE,

02:17:01.413 --> 02:17:03.348
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

02:17:03.415 --> 02:17:05.216
YOU KNOW, VERY SMALL FACILITIES

02:17:05.283 --> 02:17:07.552
THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, CRITICAL

02:17:07.619 --> 02:17:09.354
ACCESS HOSPITALS. THEY SERVE A

02:17:09.421 --> 02:17:11.489
VERY, VERY HIGH PROPORTION OF

02:17:11.556 --> 02:17:15.894
PUBLIC PAYER PATIENTS. AND THERE

02:17:15.961 --> 02:17:17.596
ARE NO OTHER PROVIDERS FOR MANY

02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:20.865
MILES AROUND. SO THERE JUST

02:17:20.932 --> 02:17:22.834
ISN'T LIKE A PLUG AND PLAY

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:25.870
ALTERNATIVE. AND SO THERE'S

02:17:25.937 --> 02:17:28.840
YEAH. AND FRANKLY SOMETHING LIKE

02:17:28.907 --> 02:17:30.008
LABOR AND DELIVERY IF YOU'VE GOT

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:32.010
VERY, VERY LOW VOLUME, KIND OF

02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:34.613
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE AND

02:17:34.679 --> 02:17:37.082
FEWER BIRTHS IN THE STATE AND

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:38.216
SOME OF THOSE KIND OF LARGER

02:17:38.283 --> 02:17:40.352
DYNAMICS, THERE'S JUST ALL THESE

02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:42.087
OTHER KIND OF FORCES THAT KIND

02:17:42.153 --> 02:17:45.357
OF GO INTO A VERY LOCAL DECISION

02:17:45.423 --> 02:17:47.859
AROUND WHAT IT TAKES TO MAINTAIN

02:17:47.926 --> 02:17:49.694
SERVICES OR KEEP A HOSPITAL

02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:53.164
OPEN. AND SO THOSE DYNAMICS ARE

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:54.899
OBVIOUSLY JUST MADE A LOT MORE

02:17:54.966 --> 02:17:55.667
CHALLENGING BY SOMETHING LIKE

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:57.535
THIS THAT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF

02:17:57.602 --> 02:17:59.204
DOLLARS THAT COME IN. YEAH. DO

02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:00.505
YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THE

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:01.940
OPERATING COST OF ONE OF THOSE

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:04.075
RURAL HOSPITALS JUST TO GIVE US?

02:18:04.142 --> 02:18:06.244
I DON'T HAVE A GREAT EXAMPLE OFF

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:08.313
THE TOP OF MY HEAD, BUT I

02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:08.947
CERTAINLY CAN PROVIDE SOMETHING

02:18:09.014 --> 02:18:10.215
TO STAFF. ALL RIGHT. MY SENSE IS

02:18:10.281 --> 02:18:11.950
FROM LOOKING, EVEN IF WE WERE

02:18:12.017 --> 02:18:13.618
JUST TO LOOK AT THE DISTRESSED

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:15.120
HOSPITALS, THE LIST OF

02:18:15.186 --> 02:18:15.987
DISTRESSED HOSPITALS THAT WE

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:19.391
HAVE, THAT A FRACTIONAL PORTION

02:18:19.457 --> 02:18:21.993
OF $50 BILLION FOR OUR RURAL

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:25.797
HOSPITALS IS LITERALLY GOING TO

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:27.632
BE A DROP IN THE BUCKET FOR OUR

02:18:27.699 --> 02:18:30.135
RURAL HOSPITALS. AND IF I DON'T

02:18:30.201 --> 02:18:31.069
HAVE THE ANSWER TO YOUR

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:32.871
QUESTION. BUT ONE THING I WOULD

02:18:32.937 --> 02:18:34.472
ALSO ADD IS THE RURAL HOSPITAL

02:18:34.539 --> 02:18:35.874
TRANSFORMATION FUND IS REALLY

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:36.875
ONE TIME SPREAD OVER THE COURSE

02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:39.444
OF, OF, OF A FEW YEARS. BUT

02:18:39.511 --> 02:18:40.845
THESE CHANGES THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:42.947
ABOUT ARE ONGOING CHANGES. THERE

02:18:43.014 --> 02:18:45.850
IS NO END DATE TO THEM. AND SO

02:18:45.917 --> 02:18:47.786
WHILE THIS MAY BE KIND OF A

02:18:47.852 --> 02:18:49.721
BAND-AID FOR SOME OF THE SHORT

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:52.057
TERM CHALLENGES, IT IS NOT A

02:18:52.123 --> 02:18:54.159
REPLACEMENT OF ONGOING FUNDING.

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:55.927
APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN MY

02:18:55.994 --> 02:18:59.864
LAST QUESTION, WE OBVIOUSLY WENT

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:01.099
THROUGH OUR BUDGETING PROCESS.

02:19:01.166 --> 02:19:04.169
WE HAD A LOT OF VERY DYNAMIC

02:19:04.235 --> 02:19:05.236
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE

02:19:05.303 --> 02:19:06.271
LEGISLATURE AND THE

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:07.205
ADMINISTRATION AROUND SOME OF

02:19:07.272 --> 02:19:09.207
THE PROPOSED CUTS AND WHAT ENDED

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:12.911
UP IN THE IN THE BUDGET. ONE OF

02:19:12.977 --> 02:19:14.913
THE THINGS THAT WE KNEW WAS

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:16.848
GOING TO BE AN ISSUE WAS THE

02:19:16.915 --> 02:19:18.116
FACT THAT WE WERE KIND OF

02:19:18.183 --> 02:19:20.719
WAITING ON HR ONE AND TO SEE THE

02:19:20.785 --> 02:19:23.955
IMPACTS OF WHAT ALL WOULD RESULT

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:27.592
FROM WHATEVER CONGRESS AND THE

02:19:27.659 --> 02:19:29.360
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ENDED UP

02:19:29.427 --> 02:19:32.597
PASSING. DO YOU ALL HAVE A SENSE

02:19:32.664 --> 02:19:36.534
OF WHETHER THERE ARE ASPECTS OF

02:19:36.601 --> 02:19:40.805
THE OUR BUDGET ACTION THAT

02:19:40.872 --> 02:19:43.108
BASICALLY NEED TO BE REVISITED

02:19:43.174 --> 02:19:45.276
BECAUSE OF HR ONE? I'LL GIVE YOU

02:19:45.343 --> 02:19:47.112
A CONCRETE EXAMPLE. MAYBE THERE

02:19:47.178 --> 02:19:49.180
MIGHT BE OTHERS. HOW WE

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:51.449
IMPLEMENTED A $30 A MONTH

02:19:51.516 --> 02:19:55.687
PREMIUM FOR UI'S INDIVIDUALS

02:19:55.754 --> 02:19:58.957
EFFECTIVE JULY 1ST, 2027. WE NOW

02:19:59.023 --> 02:20:01.059
HAVE THIS COST SHARING

02:20:01.126 --> 02:20:02.894
REQUIREMENT THAT GOES INTO

02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:09.334
EFFECT 2028 FOR ALL MEDI-CAL

02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:10.835
RECIPIENTS. THERE SEEMS TO BE.

02:20:10.902 --> 02:20:14.305
THERE'S A TIMING MISALIGNMENT

02:20:14.372 --> 02:20:17.642
POTENTIALLY THERE. ARE THERE

02:20:17.709 --> 02:20:19.144
OTHER OTHER THINGS THAT YOU

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:20.912
THINK ARE KIND OF FLOATING

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:22.714
AROUND IN OUR BUDGET THAT YOU

02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:24.482
THINK WE SHOULD BE TAKING A HARD

02:20:24.549 --> 02:20:27.485
LOOK AT RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:29.187
THAT THERE IS ALIGNMENT OR FULL

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:30.321
UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACTS OF

02:20:30.388 --> 02:20:31.956
H.R. ONE. NOTHING IS COMING TO

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:33.024
MIND. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:34.893
PREMIUM VERSUS COPAY, THOSE ARE

02:20:34.959 --> 02:20:36.027
DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. AND HOW

02:20:36.094 --> 02:20:37.061
YOU IMPLEMENT THOSE MAYBE

02:20:37.128 --> 02:20:37.829
DIFFERENTLY AS WELL. THOSE ARE

02:20:37.896 --> 02:20:39.297
THE THINGS THAT WE ARE THINKING

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:41.299
THROUGH AS PART OF RECONCILING

02:20:41.366 --> 02:20:43.168
THE STATE BUDGET DECISIONS AND

02:20:43.234 --> 02:20:44.602
EVERYTHING THAT HAS COME OUT OF

02:20:44.669 --> 02:20:46.538
HR ONE. SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:49.574
ELSE TO ADD. THANK YOU. AND I

02:20:49.641 --> 02:20:51.876
JUST WANT TO THANK DOCTOR WEBER

02:20:51.943 --> 02:20:52.911
PEARSON FOR SENATOR WEBER

02:20:52.977 --> 02:20:54.412
PEARSON FOR RAISING THE ISSUE

02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:57.148
AROUND THE IMPACTS OF THE MCO

02:20:57.215 --> 02:20:59.384
TAX AND WHAT THAT WILL HAVE. I

02:20:59.450 --> 02:21:02.220
THINK ALSO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

02:21:02.287 --> 02:21:05.890
DEVASTATING FOR OUR NOT ONLY OUR

02:21:05.957 --> 02:21:08.159
PROVIDERS, BUT FOR THE ACCESS TO

02:21:08.226 --> 02:21:13.431
BASIC CARE. SO WE ARE. WE ARE

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:15.767
GOING TO BE IN A VERY KIND OF

02:21:15.834 --> 02:21:17.068
SEMINAL MOMENT IN THE STATE OF

02:21:17.135 --> 02:21:18.837
CALIFORNIA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

02:21:18.903 --> 02:21:21.406
HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:21:21.472 --> 02:21:24.909
DEAL WITH THE INCREDIBLE,

02:21:24.976 --> 02:21:27.779
INSIDIOUS AND EVIL ASPECTS OF HR

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:30.281
ONE. AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL

02:21:30.348 --> 02:21:32.517
KIND OF GIRDING OUR LOINS, SO TO

02:21:32.584 --> 02:21:36.054
SPEAK. BUT IF THERE'S IF THERE'S

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:37.522
ONE ADMINISTRATION AGENCY

02:21:37.589 --> 02:21:40.825
ADVOCATES AND SET OF LEGISLATORS

02:21:40.892 --> 02:21:43.394
WHO CAN DO IT, I KNOW IT'S US.

02:21:43.461 --> 02:21:45.096
SO BUT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO

02:21:45.163 --> 02:21:49.167
GET TO WORK. SO THANK YOU. THANK

02:21:49.234 --> 02:21:51.903

02:23:57.095 --> 02:23:58.730
WAS THE ANCHOR OF HIS FAMILY.

02:23:58.796 --> 02:24:00.465

ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, FEAR,

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.567
ISOLATION AND LASTING TRAUMA.

02:25:09.634 --> 02:25:11.702
FAMILY LIKE HUSEBY'S ARE LEFT

02:25:11.769 --> 02:25:13.571
WITH SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. CHILDREN

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:16.107
LOSE ROLE MODELS AND STABILITY

02:25:16.174 --> 02:25:19.010
AND ELDERS FEEL ABANDONED. RAIDS

02:25:19.077 --> 02:25:20.778

TO SEE RAIDS FOR WHAT THEY ARE A

02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:31.122
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

02:25:31.189 --> 02:25:33.357
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS SHATTER

02:25:33.424 --> 02:25:35.493
TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS, DETER

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:36.861
FAMILIES FROM SEEKING HEALTH

02:25:36.928 --> 02:25:39.163
CARE, AND LEAVE LASTING SCARS ON

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:41.632
MENTAL HEALTH. CALIFORNIA MUST

02:25:41.699 --> 02:25:44.168
CONTINUE TO LEAD. WE ASK YOU TO

02:25:44.235 --> 02:25:44.836
CONSIDER POLICIES THAT KEEP

02:25:44.902 --> 02:25:45.937
FAMILIES TOGETHER, PROTECT

02:25:46.003 --> 02:25:48.106
HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, AND

02:25:48.172 --> 02:25:50.041
ENSURE THAT NO COMMUNITY LIVES

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:51.943
UNDER THE CONSTANT THREAT OF

02:25:52.009 --> 02:25:54.946
RAIDS THAT DESTROY BODIES AND

02:25:55.012 --> 02:25:57.148

PATIENTS, COMMUNITY PARTNERS,

02:28:44.982 --> 02:28:47.451
ADVOCATES, STAFF AND THE COUNTY

02:28:47.518 --> 02:28:49.587
OFFICE OF IMMIGRANT AFFAIRS THAT

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:52.156

02:28:57.061 --> 02:28:59.497
SINGLE CAUSE FOR THE DECLINES IN

02:28:59.563 --> 02:29:01.232
PATIENT VISITS, BUT WE KNOW THAT

02:29:01.299 --> 02:29:05.836
THESE MUST BE CONTRIBUTING. MANY

02:29:05.903 --> 02:29:08.806
FAMILIES. AS I NOTED, REGARDLESS

02:29:08.873 --> 02:29:10.474
OF IMMIGRATION STATUS, ARE

02:29:10.541 --> 02:29:11.542
EXPRESSING ANXIETY AND

02:29:11.609 --> 02:29:14.078
HESITATION TO SEEK CARE. AND TO

02:29:14.145 --> 02:29:17.915
LEAVE THEIR HOMES. WE ARE ALSO

02:29:17.982 --> 02:29:20.217
HEARING FROM FRONTLINE STAFF

02:29:27.858 --> 02:29:30.394
AND MY COLLEAGUES. WE KNOW THAT

02:29:30.461 --> 02:29:31.462
WALKING THROUGH THE HOSPITALS

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:32.730
AND THE CLINICS, WE SEE A

02:29:32.797 --> 02:29:34.165
DIFFERENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:29:34.231 --> 02:29:36.367
SAYING WHEN THEY TALK TO ME THAT

02:29:36.434 --> 02:29:37.802
THAT THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE IN

02:29:37.868 --> 02:29:39.437
THE WAITING ROOM. AND I SEE THE

02:29:39.503 --> 02:29:41.806
SAME THING WHEN I GO IN IN THE

02:29:41.872 --> 02:29:45.376

DECLINES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

02:29:51.215 --> 02:29:53.617
THE INITIAL ICE RAIDS. ICE

02:29:53.684 --> 02:29:54.719
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT TOOK

02:30:03.761 --> 02:30:06.497

BUSINESS. AND OUR PRIMARY GOAL

02:30:58.115 --> 02:31:01.218
IS ALWAYS TO PROVIDE CARE. WE

02:31:01.285 --> 02:31:05.256
ARE NOT HERE TO COOPERATE WITH

02:31:05.322 --> 02:31:08.125
WITH ICE ENFORCEMENT AND THAT

02:31:08.192 --> 02:31:09.493
PRIVACY LAWS THAT PEOPLE MAY

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:12.830
WORRY ABOUT THEIR INFORMATION

BEING SHARED WITH OTHERS.

02:31:13.931 --> 02:31:16.267

02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:25.443
WILL NOT SHARE. SHARE PATIENT

INFORMATION WITHOUT WITHOUT

02:31:29.079 --> 02:31:32.183
APPROPRIATE PERMISSION. WE'VE

02:31:32.249 --> 02:31:35.886
ALSO BEEN EXPANDING, WORKING TO

02:31:44.829 --> 02:31:45.930
MODALITIES THAT PATIENTS ARE

02:31:45.996 --> 02:31:48.199
ABLE TO ACCESS TO RECEIVE THE

02:31:48.265 --> 02:31:49.834
CARE THAT THEY NEED, EVEN IF

02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:53.204
THEY ARE AFRAID TO VENTURE

02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:54.605
OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOMES OR TO OUR

DELIVERING IN CARE IN-PERSON

02:32:03.614 --> 02:32:05.049
CARE, WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH

02:32:05.115 --> 02:32:07.251
OUR HEALTH PLAN PARTNERS WHO ARE

02:32:07.318 --> 02:32:08.986

RESOURCES, TO DO THE SAME THING.

02:32:17.328 --> 02:32:21.165
I WANT TO NOTE THAT THE DECLINES

02:32:21.232 --> 02:32:24.168
IN VISITS THAT WE SEE, AND WE

02:32:24.235 --> 02:32:25.069
ANTICIPATE SEEING INTO THE

02:32:25.135 --> 02:32:28.105
FUTURE AND THE CONCERN FROM OUR

02:32:28.172 --> 02:32:29.440
STAFF, MEAN THAT PEOPLE WILL

02:32:29.507 --> 02:32:31.709
RECEIVE LESS CARE, BOTH OF THE

02:32:31.775 --> 02:32:33.210
ACUTE AND ONGOING CARE THAT THEY

02:32:33.277 --> 02:32:34.445
NEED AS A RESULT, AND THEIR

02:32:34.512 --> 02:32:36.714
HEALTH CARE, THEIR HEALTH WILL

02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:39.350
SUFFER. THEIR ABILITY TO CARE

02:32:39.416 --> 02:32:41.051
FOR THEIR FAMILIES IN THEIR

02:32:41.118 --> 02:32:42.753
COMMUNITIES WILL ALSO SUFFER,

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:44.522
AND COSTS WILL GO UP AS A

02:32:44.588 --> 02:32:46.323
RESULT. WE KNOW THAT PREVENTIVE

02:32:46.390 --> 02:32:48.626
CARE IS COST EFFECTIVE, AND AS

02:32:48.692 --> 02:32:50.027
PATIENTS AVOID CARE OR THEY

02:32:50.094 --> 02:32:52.563
AVOID COMING IN AT THE BEGINNING

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:56.200
OF A AN ACUTE EPISODE, THE

02:32:56.267 --> 02:32:58.035
ABILITY TO AND THE COST OF CARE

02:32:58.102 --> 02:33:02.172
OF THEM GOES UP AND BECOMES MORE

02:33:02.239 --> 02:33:08.812
DIFFICULT. PREVENTING PEOPLE

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:09.813
FROM ACCESSING THE CARE THAT

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:11.582
THEY NEED. ALWAYS HAS AN IMPACT

02:33:11.649 --> 02:33:12.783
BOTH TO INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES

02:33:12.850 --> 02:33:15.920

OBSTACLES PUT IN FRONT OF THEM.

02:33:26.497 --> 02:33:28.966

02:33:59.196 --> 02:34:00.931
GUATEMALA AND A MOTHER OF TWO

02:34:00.998 --> 02:34:03.367
LITTLE GIRLS. THANK YOU FOR THE

02:34:03.434 --> 02:34:05.235
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE

02:34:05.302 --> 02:34:05.869
IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION

02:34:05.936 --> 02:34:07.438
ENFORCEMENT ON CALIFORNIA'S

02:34:07.504 --> 02:34:08.906
CHILDREN. TODAY, I WANT TO

02:34:08.973 --> 02:34:10.941
HIGHLIGHT A CRITICAL BUT OFTEN

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:13.143
OVERLOOKED ISSUE HOW IMMIGRATION

02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:14.578
ENFORCEMENT DISRUPTS CHILDREN'S

02:34:14.645 --> 02:34:16.413
ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD

02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:19.316
EDUCATION, ALSO KNOWN AS S AND

02:34:19.383 --> 02:34:20.751
SCHOOLS, SPACES THAT ARE

02:34:20.818 --> 02:34:22.519
ESSENTIAL TO THEIR HEALTH AND

02:34:22.586 --> 02:34:24.688
DEVELOPMENT. WHY THIS MATTERS.

02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:26.557
IN ADDITION TO ACCESS TO MEDICAL

02:34:26.624 --> 02:34:28.325
CARE, HEALTH, CHILDREN'S HEALTH

02:34:28.392 --> 02:34:30.294
IS SHAPED BY SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL,

02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:32.930
AND FAMILY WELL-BEING. SAFE

02:34:32.997 --> 02:34:34.031
NEIGHBORHOODS NURTURING,

02:34:34.098 --> 02:34:35.899
NURTURING RELATIONSHIPS AND

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:37.267
SUPPORTIVE LEARNING

02:34:37.334 --> 02:34:39.803
ENVIRONMENTS. SPACES AND K

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:41.205
THROUGH 12 SCHOOLS ARE AMONGST

02:34:41.271 --> 02:34:42.973
THE MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTS

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:44.808
FOR BUILDING THIS WELL-BEING.

02:34:44.875 --> 02:34:46.210
THEY ARE OFTEN THE FIRST

02:34:46.276 --> 02:34:48.012
COMMUNITY SPACES OUTSIDE THE

02:34:48.078 --> 02:34:49.847
HOME WHERE CHILDREN LEARN SOCIAL

02:34:49.913 --> 02:34:52.116
EMOTIONAL SKILLS, EXPERIENCE

02:34:52.182 --> 02:34:53.550
BELONGING, AND CONNECT WITH

02:34:53.617 --> 02:34:55.619
CRITICAL SUPPORTS. WHEN

02:34:55.686 --> 02:34:57.121
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT REACHES

02:34:57.187 --> 02:34:59.657
INTO OR NEAR THESE SPACES, IT

02:34:59.723 --> 02:35:01.291
UNDERMINES EVERY PROTECTIVE

02:35:01.358 --> 02:35:04.261
FACTOR THAT CHILDREN RELY ON.

02:35:04.328 --> 02:35:05.696
HERE'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE.

02:35:05.763 --> 02:35:07.631
AFTER RECENT DEPORTATION SWEEPS

02:35:07.698 --> 02:35:09.299
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY, A

02:35:09.366 --> 02:35:12.236
STANFORD STUDY FOUND A JUMP OF

02:35:12.302 --> 02:35:14.405
22% IN SCHOOL ABSENCES ACROSS

02:35:14.471 --> 02:35:16.473
SEVERAL DISTRICTS. PARENTS KEPT

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:18.742
CHILDREN HOME OUT OF FEAR THEY

02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:20.477
MIGHT BE SEPARATED. IN LOS

02:35:20.544 --> 02:35:22.613
ANGELES, A 15 YEAR OLD DISABLED

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:24.615
STUDENT WAS MISTAKENLY DETAINED

02:35:24.682 --> 02:35:26.984
AT GUNPOINT BY BORDER PATROL

02:35:27.051 --> 02:35:29.053
AGENTS NEAR HIS HIGH SCHOOL AND

02:35:29.119 --> 02:35:30.354
UNDOUBTEDLY TRAUMATIC INCIDENT

02:35:30.421 --> 02:35:32.423
THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE DANGERS OF

02:35:32.489 --> 02:35:34.091
ENFORCEMENT NEAR SCHOOL ZONES.

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:37.461
IN SPACES. PROVIDERS LIKE ELIDA

02:35:37.528 --> 02:35:39.263
CRUZ IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TELL

02:35:39.329 --> 02:35:41.331
US PARENTS ARE TOO AFRAID TO

02:35:41.398 --> 02:35:42.566
LEAVE HOME. SHE NOW DELIVERS

02:35:42.633 --> 02:35:44.601
GROCERIES AND USES CODE WORDS

02:35:44.668 --> 02:35:46.470
WITH FAMILIES JUST SO THEY FEEL

02:35:46.537 --> 02:35:48.839
SAFE OPENING THE DOOR. SHE

02:35:48.906 --> 02:35:49.907
WORRIES THAT IF FAMILIES

02:35:49.973 --> 02:35:51.809
WITHDRAW ENTIRELY, HER PROGRAM

02:35:51.875 --> 02:35:54.278
WILL COLLAPSE. THESE ARE NOT

02:35:54.344 --> 02:35:56.046
ISOLATED INCIDENTS. THEY SHOW

02:35:56.113 --> 02:35:57.514
THAT WHEN IMMIGRATION

02:35:57.581 --> 02:35:58.949
ENFORCEMENT REACHES INTO

02:35:59.016 --> 02:36:00.451
SENSITIVE LOCATIONS LIKE SCHOOLS

02:36:00.517 --> 02:36:03.220
AND SPACES, IT DISMANTLES THE

02:36:03.287 --> 02:36:05.089
SAFE, STABLE ENVIRONMENTS

02:36:05.155 --> 02:36:07.257
CHILDREN NEED TO THRIVE. THIS

02:36:07.324 --> 02:36:09.393
THREAT IS NOT ONLY TO FAMILIES,

02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:11.095
BUT ALSO TO THE WORKFORCE

02:36:11.161 --> 02:36:14.031
ITSELF. ALREADY, THE SECTOR

02:36:14.098 --> 02:36:16.100
STRUGGLES WITH LOW WAGES, HIGH

02:36:16.166 --> 02:36:17.935
TURNOVER AND CHRONIC

02:36:18.001 --> 02:36:20.137
UNDERSTAFFING. IMMIGRATION.

02:36:20.204 --> 02:36:21.538
IMMIGRANTS COMPRISE OF

02:36:21.605 --> 02:36:24.241
APPROXIMATELY 39% OF WORKFORCE

02:36:24.308 --> 02:36:26.744
IN CALIFORNIA, FAR EXCEEDING THE

02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:29.113
NATIONAL AVERAGE. A NEW FEDERAL

02:36:29.179 --> 02:36:30.547
DIRECTIVE TO RESTRICT

02:36:30.614 --> 02:36:32.116
UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN FROM HEAD

02:36:32.182 --> 02:36:34.151
START WILL FURTHER DESTABILIZE

02:36:34.218 --> 02:36:35.586
PROGRAMS, LEAVING CHILDREN

02:36:35.652 --> 02:36:38.122
WITHOUT CARE. SO WHAT MUST WE

02:36:38.188 --> 02:36:41.058
DO? ONE. ADVANCE AND IMPLEMENT

02:36:41.125 --> 02:36:44.261
LEGISLATION SUCH AS AB 49 AND AB

02:36:44.328 --> 02:36:46.363
49 TO ENSURE CHILDREN, YOUTH AND

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:47.965
FAMILIES FEEL SECURE IN THEIR

02:36:48.031 --> 02:36:51.435
SCHOOLS AND SPACES. TWO PROVIDE

02:36:51.502 --> 02:36:53.337
GUIDANCE AND TRAINING TO

02:36:53.403 --> 02:36:55.706
EDUCATORS AND PROVIDERS ON CIVIL

02:36:55.773 --> 02:36:57.007
PROTECTIONS, IMMIGRANT RIGHTS

02:36:57.074 --> 02:36:59.777
AND MENTAL HEALTH. STRENGTHENING

02:36:59.843 --> 02:37:01.445
COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND

02:37:01.512 --> 02:37:03.247
AGENCIES TO ENSURE CONSISTENT

02:37:03.313 --> 02:37:05.916
SUPPORT IS A GOOD START. THREE

02:37:05.983 --> 02:37:07.417
INCREASE AND EXPAND STATE

02:37:07.484 --> 02:37:09.453
FUNDING FOR IMMIGRATION LEGAL

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.255
SERVICES WITH A SPECIFIC

02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:13.390
INVESTMENT IN S AND K THROUGH 12

02:37:13.457 --> 02:37:15.726
SCHOOL SETTINGS AND FOUR MOVE TO

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:18.395
NEW ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY.

02:37:18.462 --> 02:37:21.331
METHODOLOGY TO SET RATES THAT

02:37:21.398 --> 02:37:23.200
ACTUALLY REFLECT THE TRUE COST

02:37:23.267 --> 02:37:26.036
OF CARE, SPECIFICALLY BY

02:37:26.103 --> 02:37:27.538
BEGINNING TO FUND THE COST OF

02:37:27.604 --> 02:37:29.606
CARE FACING IN THE NEXT YEAR'S

02:37:29.673 --> 02:37:31.742
BUDGET. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO

02:37:31.809 --> 02:37:34.211
OVER 4 MILLION CHILDREN IN

02:37:34.278 --> 02:37:36.146
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES, NEARLY HALF

02:37:36.213 --> 02:37:38.949
OF ALL CHILDREN IN OUR STATE. IF

02:37:39.016 --> 02:37:40.450
IMMIGRANT IMMIGRATION

02:37:40.517 --> 02:37:42.953
ENFORCEMENT KEEPS THEM OUT OF

02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:45.422
CLASSROOMS AND SPACES, WE'RE NOT

02:37:45.489 --> 02:37:47.291
ONLY HARMING FAMILIES TODAY,

02:37:47.357 --> 02:37:49.092
WE'RE UNDERMINING CALIFORNIA'S

02:37:49.159 --> 02:37:51.195
FUTURE. CHILDREN DEPEND ON US,

02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:52.796
THE ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES, TO

02:37:52.863 --> 02:37:54.832
PROVIDE SAFETY, STABILITY AND

02:37:54.898 --> 02:37:56.967
OPPORTUNITY. WE MUST NOT FAIL

02:37:57.034 --> 02:37:59.536
THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO

02:37:59.603 --> 02:38:01.371
MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

02:38:01.438 --> 02:38:02.940
WE'LL DIVE INTO SOME QUESTIONS

02:38:03.006 --> 02:38:12.149
HERE. Ó Þ. I'LL KICK SENATOR.

02:38:12.216 --> 02:38:14.284
YOU'RE YOU'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF

02:38:14.351 --> 02:38:18.655
THE COUNTY OF LA. YES,

02:38:18.722 --> 02:38:19.356
PARTICULARLY THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:38:19.423 --> 02:38:22.993
HEALTH SERVICES. OKAY. JUST

02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:24.628
CURIOUS. THE COUNTY OF LA IS THE

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:26.930
LARGEST COUNTY IN THE UNITED

02:38:26.997 --> 02:38:28.665
STATES GEOGRAPHICALLY, AND I.

02:38:28.732 --> 02:38:31.869
YES IT IS. YES IT IS. SO IS IT

02:38:31.935 --> 02:38:34.671
POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GIVE US MORE

02:38:34.738 --> 02:38:37.641
STATISTICS? YOU SPOKE VERY

02:38:37.708 --> 02:38:39.710
GENERALLY ABOUT OBSERVATIONS,

02:38:39.776 --> 02:38:42.246
BUT YOU DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY DATA.

02:38:42.312 --> 02:38:44.081
AND AGAIN, I'M GOING TO STRESS

02:38:44.147 --> 02:38:47.017
THAT AS WE'RE OUT IN THE

02:38:47.084 --> 02:38:48.452
COMMUNITY, IT'S GOING TO BECOME

02:38:48.518 --> 02:38:51.355
VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE, AT LEAST

02:38:51.421 --> 02:38:53.257
US AS LEGISLATORS, WE NEED TO

02:38:53.323 --> 02:38:55.993
SPEAK FROM Þ. WE'RE SEEING A

02:38:56.059 --> 02:38:57.861
REDUCTION IN THE EMERGENCY

02:38:57.928 --> 02:38:59.263
ROOMS. WHAT ARE WE SEEING? ARE

02:38:59.329 --> 02:39:02.132
WE SEEING 10%? ARE WE SEEING 8%

02:39:02.199 --> 02:39:07.871
AS I SPOKE, WE SAW A 14%

02:39:07.938 --> 02:39:09.806
REDUCTION FROM MAY TO JUNE IN

02:39:09.873 --> 02:39:11.608
OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. I

02:39:11.675 --> 02:39:13.343
JUST GAVE THAT AS ONE EXAMPLE.

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:15.913
THERE WERE YOU. LET ME REPHRASE

02:39:15.979 --> 02:39:18.448
THIS. THANK YOU FOR COMING. YOU

02:39:18.515 --> 02:39:21.218
GAVE AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION.

02:39:21.285 --> 02:39:22.719
THERE WERE JUST SEVERAL POINTS.

02:39:22.786 --> 02:39:24.454
I JUST THREW OUT EMERGENCY ROOM

02:39:24.521 --> 02:39:26.290
I DIDN'T WRITE DOWN BECAUSE I

02:39:26.356 --> 02:39:28.759
DON'T HAVE A COPY OF YOUR

02:39:28.825 --> 02:39:30.994
PRESENTATION. RIGHT. SO YOU WENT

02:39:31.061 --> 02:39:32.663
THROUGH SEVERAL POINTS OF

02:39:32.729 --> 02:39:33.830
OBSERVATIONS, BUT IT DIDN'T

02:39:33.897 --> 02:39:35.232
PROVIDE THE DATA. WE'D BE HAPPY

02:39:35.299 --> 02:39:37.434
TO PROVIDE. IF YOU WOULD BE SO

02:39:37.501 --> 02:39:38.802
KIND AS TO PROVIDE IT TO THE

02:39:38.869 --> 02:39:40.037
COMMITTEE, IT WOULD BE REALLY

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:42.105
HELPFUL BECAUSE FOR ME, WHEN I'M

02:39:42.172 --> 02:39:44.541
OUT SPEAKING, PARTICULARLY IF

02:39:44.608 --> 02:39:47.544
WE'RE SPEAKING TO GROUPS, THAT

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:50.781
MAY NOT BE EITHER ONE IS OPEN TO

02:39:50.847 --> 02:39:52.883
CONCUR WITH THE INFORMATION THAT

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:55.352
WE'RE PROVIDING OR TO JUST, YOU

02:39:55.419 --> 02:39:56.954
KNOW, FLAT OUT DENY IT. IT

02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:58.822
REALLY HELPS US TO BE ABLE TO

02:39:58.889 --> 02:40:01.191
SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT WE'RE

02:40:01.258 --> 02:40:02.659
SEEING. THANK YOU, SIR, TO DO

02:40:02.726 --> 02:40:09.733
THAT. GREAT PRESENTATION. THANK.

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:14.972
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I THINK I'LL

02:40:15.038 --> 02:40:19.876
START OFF WITH YOU. LISA. LISA,

02:40:19.943 --> 02:40:21.345
THANK YOU SO MUCH. YES, I KNOW

02:40:21.411 --> 02:40:24.481
YOU SPOKE ON Â AND I KNOW YOU

02:40:24.548 --> 02:40:26.083
KNOW, THE WE CAN SEE THE

02:40:26.149 --> 02:40:28.618
CONNECTION WITH HEALTH AND SO ON

02:40:28.685 --> 02:40:29.886
AC BUT I'D LIKE TO PIVOT A

02:40:29.953 --> 02:40:32.189
LITTLE BIT MORE TO WHAT WE SAW,

02:40:32.255 --> 02:40:34.658
THE IMPACTS OF COVID ON OUR

02:40:34.725 --> 02:40:37.260
YOUTH. AND CAN WE ASSUME IT

02:40:37.327 --> 02:40:39.296
MIGHT BE TOO EARLY FOR SOME OF

02:40:39.363 --> 02:40:41.098
THE DATA? BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE

02:40:41.164 --> 02:40:42.232
TWO AND A HALF MONTHS INTO ALL

02:40:42.299 --> 02:40:44.134
OF THIS, RIGHT? SO MAYBE TWO

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:46.636
PRELIMINARY, BUT ARE WE SEE ARE

02:40:46.703 --> 02:40:47.371
WE POTENTIALLY GOING TO SEE THE

02:40:47.437 --> 02:40:49.206
SAME KIND OF IMPACT ON THESE

02:40:49.272 --> 02:40:50.774
KIDS WHO HAVE THEIR FAMILIES

02:40:50.841 --> 02:40:53.310
DETAINED? AND FOLLOW UP TO THAT

02:40:53.377 --> 02:40:55.579
IS, ARE WE HAVING CONVERSATIONS

02:40:55.645 --> 02:40:58.315
TO ADD THIS INTO WHAT THE ACE

02:40:58.382 --> 02:41:00.617
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPOSURES CAN

02:41:00.684 --> 02:41:05.322
THIS QUALIFY NOW AS AN ACE? YES.

02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:08.158
I MEAN, I, YOU KNOW, INFANT AND

02:41:08.225 --> 02:41:09.559
EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH,

02:41:09.626 --> 02:41:11.061
YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH AND EVEN THE

02:41:11.128 --> 02:41:12.696
MENTAL HEALTH OF WORKFORCE OF

02:41:12.763 --> 02:41:14.331
THE WORKFORCES LIKE THE

02:41:14.398 --> 02:41:16.867
TEACHERS, EDUCATORS, PROVIDERS,

02:41:16.933 --> 02:41:18.235
ALL OF THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

02:41:18.301 --> 02:41:20.337
COMING UP ON A CONSISTENT BASIS

02:41:20.404 --> 02:41:21.104
WHEN WE'RE SPEAKING TO PEOPLE ON

02:41:21.171 --> 02:41:23.273
THE GROUND AND COMMUNITY

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:24.408
MEMBERS. YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T

02:41:24.474 --> 02:41:26.076
HAVE SPECIFIC DATA ON THE

02:41:26.143 --> 02:41:27.577
NUMBERS. I DO THINK THAT THERE

02:41:27.644 --> 02:41:29.146
IS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN

02:41:29.212 --> 02:41:31.081
WHAT WE SAW IN COVID 19 AND WHAT

02:41:31.148 --> 02:41:32.883
WE'RE SEEING NOW, SPECIFICALLY

02:41:32.949 --> 02:41:34.985
BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE ISOLATION,

02:41:35.052 --> 02:41:37.020
THE FEAR OF FAMILY SEPARATION

02:41:37.087 --> 02:41:39.056
RIGHT NOW. NOW JUST NOT THROUGH

02:41:39.122 --> 02:41:40.490
HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH, BUT

02:41:40.557 --> 02:41:42.292
ALSO THROUGH IMMIGRATION

02:41:42.359 --> 02:41:44.728
ENFORCEMENT AND ALL OF THOSE.

02:41:44.795 --> 02:41:47.030
AND SO I DO THINK, I MEAN, ONE

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:52.102
OF THE ACS INDICATORS IS

02:41:52.169 --> 02:41:53.270
SEPARATION FROM FAMILY. I DON'T

02:41:53.336 --> 02:41:56.440
I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT DETAIL

02:41:56.506 --> 02:41:59.976
THERE, BUT BUT YES, THAT THAT IS

02:42:00.043 --> 02:42:02.179
ABSOLUTELY CORRELATED WITH ACS.

02:42:02.245 --> 02:42:05.682
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT HEALTH

02:42:05.749 --> 02:42:06.783
MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES ARE

02:42:06.850 --> 02:42:08.718
MAKING THAT CONNECTION AND

02:42:08.785 --> 02:42:09.986
ENSURING THAT THEY'RE SUPPORTING

02:42:10.053 --> 02:42:13.290
FOLKS AND IN FOR TELEHEALTH. YOU

02:42:13.356 --> 02:42:14.825
KNOW, I THINK, DOCTOR, YOU

02:42:14.891 --> 02:42:15.826
TALKED ABOUT LIKE TAKING

02:42:15.892 --> 02:42:18.295
ADVANTAGE OF TELEHEALTH OPTIONS,

02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:20.130
BUT ARE YOU HEARING ANY DIGITAL

02:42:20.197 --> 02:42:22.566
BARRIER TO THAT AS AN OPTION FOR

02:42:22.632 --> 02:42:24.901
A LOT OF THESE FAMILIES? WE

02:42:24.968 --> 02:42:25.869
HAVEN'T HEARD SPECIFICALLY, BUT

02:42:25.936 --> 02:42:27.704
WE KNOW, OF COURSE, THAT FOR

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:29.106
PEOPLE WITH LIMITED RESOURCES,

02:42:29.172 --> 02:42:32.409
THAT IS THAT IS GOING TO BE A

02:42:32.476 --> 02:42:35.612
BARRIER. THIS IS WHY THE HEALTH

02:42:35.679 --> 02:42:38.815
PLANS HAVE TALKED TO US ABOUT

02:42:38.882 --> 02:42:40.150
THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS,

02:42:40.217 --> 02:42:42.085
WHERE PATIENTS CAN ALSO COME IN

02:42:42.152 --> 02:42:43.887
AND ACCESS THE TECHNOLOGY THEY

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:46.389
NEED TO DO DIGITAL VISITS,

02:42:46.456 --> 02:42:48.525
TELEHEALTH VISITS, BUT IT STILL

02:42:48.592 --> 02:42:50.327
REQUIRES THEM TO VENTURE OUT.

02:42:50.393 --> 02:42:52.162
AND SO THEY MAY STILL BE

02:42:52.229 --> 02:42:54.231
APPREHENSIVE. AND YOU MENTIONED

02:42:54.297 --> 02:42:55.799
WE CAN'T POINT TO A SINGLE

02:42:55.866 --> 02:42:57.634
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DECLINE. YOU

02:42:57.701 --> 02:42:59.302
SAID, BUT WE DO KNOW WHEN THE

02:42:59.369 --> 02:43:02.639
DECLINE STARTED. CORRECT? WELL,

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:03.473
THAT'S THE WINDOW THAT WE'VE

02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:06.576
LOOKED AT MAY AND JUNE, MAY,

02:43:06.643 --> 02:43:09.446
JUNE AND JULY SO FAR. YEAH. SO

02:43:09.513 --> 02:43:11.214
BUT IS IT SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS

02:43:11.281 --> 02:43:14.284
IS AN UNCOMMON DECLINE? I DON'T

02:43:14.351 --> 02:43:15.952
KNOW, I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO

02:43:16.019 --> 02:43:17.787
YOU. OKAY. YEAH, I'D BE GOOD.

02:43:17.854 --> 02:43:19.489
JUST FOR TALKING POINT TO SEE IF

02:43:19.556 --> 02:43:23.126
THIS IS AN ABNORMALITY. IS THIS

02:43:23.193 --> 02:43:24.528
ARE WE CONTINUING TO SEE A

02:43:24.594 --> 02:43:26.696
DECLINE SINCE JANUARY, THE YEAR

02:43:26.763 --> 02:43:28.632
BEFORE? IT'D BE GOOD TO

02:43:28.698 --> 02:43:30.500
PINPOINT. I KNOW IT'S HARD AGAIN

02:43:30.567 --> 02:43:31.334
TO PINPOINT TO A SINGLE

02:43:31.401 --> 02:43:32.169
CONTRIBUTOR, BUT, LIKE, JUST

02:43:32.235 --> 02:43:33.904
WHEN THE DECLINES REALLY STARTED

02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:36.406
TO HAPPEN. THIS WAS BROUGHT UP

02:43:36.473 --> 02:43:38.642
TO ME IN MY COMMUNITY AROUND

02:43:38.708 --> 02:43:41.211
THIS TOPIC ABOUT MOBILE VISITS

02:43:41.278 --> 02:43:43.947
INTO THE COMMUNITY. DON'T KNOW

02:43:44.014 --> 02:43:46.616
DOCTOR, IF YOU CAN SPEAK ON. IS

02:43:46.683 --> 02:43:48.285
THAT POSSIBLE? I KNOW DURING

02:43:48.351 --> 02:43:49.719
COVID WE DID MOBILE VACCINES. I

02:43:49.786 --> 02:43:51.254
MEAN, WE HAD AMBULANCES GOING

02:43:51.321 --> 02:43:53.323
INTO COMMUNITIES AND IN FRONT OF

02:43:53.390 --> 02:43:56.259
APARTMENTS AND DOING THIS. IT'S

02:43:56.326 --> 02:43:58.094
POSSIBLE. IT'S A IT'S A QUESTION

02:43:58.161 --> 02:43:59.763
THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP. WE

02:43:59.829 --> 02:44:01.598
CURRENTLY HAVE A FEW MOBILE

02:44:01.665 --> 02:44:03.900
CLINICS THAT WE USE PRIMARILY TO

02:44:03.967 --> 02:44:07.037
SERVICE UNHOUSED POPULATIONS

02:44:07.103 --> 02:44:08.638
WHERE THEY ARE STREET MEDICINE,

02:44:08.705 --> 02:44:11.408
STREET MEDICINE. THERE HAS BEEN

02:44:11.474 --> 02:44:12.909
SOME QUESTION INTERNALLY ABOUT

02:44:12.976 --> 02:44:14.611
WHETHER THEY COULD BE

02:44:14.678 --> 02:44:16.046
REPURPOSED. ONE CONCERN THAT HAS

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:18.548
BEEN RAISED IS, IS WHETHER THE

02:44:18.615 --> 02:44:19.950
PRESENCE OF THE MOBILE VAN WILL

02:44:20.016 --> 02:44:22.886
ITSELF CAUSE ITS OWN KIND OF

02:44:22.953 --> 02:44:24.287
ATTRACT ATTENTION, YOU KNOW,

02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:26.089
WILL WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:28.391
ITSELF. SO SOMETHING THAT WE

02:44:28.458 --> 02:44:30.026
WILL CONSIDER AND CONSIDER

02:44:30.093 --> 02:44:31.795
WHETHER WE CAN DO EFFECTIVELY

02:44:31.861 --> 02:44:34.364
AND SAFELY WITHOUT DETRIMENTALLY

02:44:34.431 --> 02:44:35.265
AFFECTING THE OTHER SERVICES

02:44:35.332 --> 02:44:37.667
THAT WE'RE ALREADY. OKAY. AND

02:44:37.734 --> 02:44:40.103
THEN YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF

02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:42.339
THE MYTHS, PREVENTATIVE CARE

02:44:42.405 --> 02:44:44.207
APPOINTMENTS. YEAH. SO ARE WE

02:44:44.274 --> 02:44:46.209
SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING A

02:44:46.276 --> 02:44:50.180
DECLINE IN EMERGENCY SURGERIES?

02:44:50.247 --> 02:44:51.748
DIALYSIS TREATMENTS ARE

02:44:51.815 --> 02:44:53.183
HAPPENING. IT'S ONLY ON THE

02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:54.317
PREVENTATIVE CARE. NO. WE'VE

02:44:54.384 --> 02:44:56.353
SEEN A DECLINE PRIMARILY IN

02:44:56.419 --> 02:44:58.622
EMERGENCY AND URGENT CARE

02:44:58.688 --> 02:45:01.358
VISITS. I WAS EMPHASIZING THAT

02:45:01.424 --> 02:45:04.628
MOST PREVENTIVE CARE VISITS HAVE

02:45:04.694 --> 02:45:06.830
DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS. OKAY. SO

02:45:06.896 --> 02:45:08.231
IT'S THE OPPOSITE THAT WE'RE

02:45:08.298 --> 02:45:10.800
SEEING RIGHT NOW. YES. OKAY. AND

02:45:10.867 --> 02:45:14.404
THEN LISA, BACK TO YOU AND MAYBE

02:45:14.471 --> 02:45:15.438
CHIRLA, YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS ON

02:45:15.505 --> 02:45:18.942
ANECDOTAL STORIES ARE AND I WAS

02:45:19.009 --> 02:45:20.910
JUST HAVING THIS CONVERSATION A

02:45:20.977 --> 02:45:22.145
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, ABOUT A

02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:23.980
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, CALIFORNIA

02:45:24.047 --> 02:45:25.448
WAS RANKED 44. I FOUND THE

02:45:25.515 --> 02:45:31.087
ARTICLE 44 IN TERMS OF. 0 TO 5

02:45:31.154 --> 02:45:33.323
KIDS GOING TO SEE THEIR

02:45:33.390 --> 02:45:34.724
PEDIATRICIAN. AND I'M WONDERING

02:45:34.791 --> 02:45:37.761
IF WE'RE HEARING THAT NOW OF

02:45:37.827 --> 02:45:40.597
PARENTS, UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS

02:45:40.664 --> 02:45:42.399
NOT TAKING THEIR DOCUMENTED KID

02:45:42.465 --> 02:45:44.200
TO SEE THEIR PEDIATRICIAN DURING

02:45:44.267 --> 02:45:47.871
THIS AGE. YES, WE'RE HEARING NOT

02:45:47.937 --> 02:45:50.407
JUST FEARS OF GOING TO DOCTOR'S

02:45:50.473 --> 02:45:52.175
APPOINTMENTS, BUT ALSO FEARS AND

02:45:52.242 --> 02:45:54.711
ANXIETIES WHEN SEEKING LEGAL

02:45:54.778 --> 02:45:57.947
SERVICES AS WELL. OKAY, IS THAT

02:45:58.014 --> 02:45:59.749
FALLING ALSO IN THE LABOR AND

02:45:59.816 --> 02:46:01.818
DELIVERY WORLD? HAVE WE HEARD

02:46:01.885 --> 02:46:05.055
ANYTHING IN THAT SPACE? I HAVE

02:46:05.121 --> 02:46:09.159
NOT. OKAY. AND I TAKE CARE OF

02:46:09.225 --> 02:46:10.026
NEWBORNS, BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD

02:46:10.093 --> 02:46:13.730
ANY SPECIFICS ABOUT LABOR AND

02:46:13.797 --> 02:46:16.266
DELIVERY YET. I HAVE NOT, BUT I

02:46:16.333 --> 02:46:18.802
CAN DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU.

02:46:18.868 --> 02:46:23.173
OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR

02:46:23.239 --> 02:46:24.574
KIND OF HUMANIZING THE MOMENT

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:26.076
THAT WE ARE IN. I REALLY

02:46:26.142 --> 02:46:28.478
APPRECIATE THE OPENING OF THE

02:46:28.545 --> 02:46:30.680
PANEL WITH YOUR QUESTION, YOUR

02:46:30.747 --> 02:46:34.617
YOUR COMMENTS IN PARTICULAR.

02:46:34.684 --> 02:46:38.221
MONICA, THE I JUST FOR SOME

02:46:38.288 --> 02:46:41.057
CONTEXT, ALAMEDA COUNTY IS MY

02:46:41.124 --> 02:46:42.859
DISTRICT. IT'S YOU KNOW, THERE'S

02:46:42.926 --> 02:46:44.694
LA COUNTY, ALAMEDA COUNTY, SANTA

02:46:44.761 --> 02:46:47.230
CLARA COUNTY ARE MAJOR HUBS

02:46:47.297 --> 02:46:49.432
CARRYING A LOT OF THE NUMBER OF

02:46:49.499 --> 02:46:51.601
PEOPLE WHO ARE MEMBERS OF

02:46:51.668 --> 02:46:53.370
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. WE'VE I'VE

02:46:53.436 --> 02:46:55.505
SPENT TIME TALKING TO SEVERAL OF

02:46:55.572 --> 02:46:58.608
MY HEALTHCARE CENTER, COMMUNITY

02:46:58.675 --> 02:47:01.077
HEALTHCARE CLINICS, FQHCS AND

02:47:01.144 --> 02:47:03.046
ALL OF AND I ACTUALLY DID TALK

02:47:03.113 --> 02:47:05.615
TO ALTAMED AS WELL IN LA, IN LA,

02:47:05.682 --> 02:47:07.884
IN ORANGE COUNTY AREA, AND ALL

02:47:07.951 --> 02:47:09.953
OF THEM ARE EXPERIENCING

02:47:10.019 --> 02:47:12.455
DECLINES THAT MIRROR DOCTOR

02:47:12.522 --> 02:47:14.357
PATEL, THE NUMBER THAT NUMBERS

02:47:14.424 --> 02:47:15.492
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT KIND

02:47:15.558 --> 02:47:17.861
OF IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 15 TO

02:47:17.927 --> 02:47:20.029
25%, A REDUCTION IN ACCESS TO

02:47:20.096 --> 02:47:24.768
SERVICES, WHICH MAKES SENSE IN

02:47:24.834 --> 02:47:26.503
IN MY CITY IN OAKLAND, THERE WAS

02:47:26.569 --> 02:47:31.875
A SPOTTING OF ICE VEHICLES IN AN

02:47:31.941 --> 02:47:34.844
ICE. ICE FOLKS IN, IN THE MIDDLE

02:47:34.911 --> 02:47:38.281
OF CHINATOWN AND IN THE

02:47:38.348 --> 02:47:41.317
FRUITVALE DISTRICT, LARGELY

02:47:41.384 --> 02:47:44.587
LATINO AND OR ASIAN AAPI

02:47:44.654 --> 02:47:45.655
COMMUNITIES IN LATINO

02:47:45.722 --> 02:47:47.757
COMMUNITIES, RESPECTIVELY. AND

02:47:47.824 --> 02:47:49.659
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, OUR OUR

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:52.495
HEALTHCARE CENTERS WHO ARE

02:47:52.562 --> 02:47:53.963
STRUGGLING WITH THAT. SO THERE'S

02:47:54.030 --> 02:47:55.298
NOT ONLY THE KIND OF THE HUMAN

02:47:55.365 --> 02:47:56.866
IMPACT. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:47:56.933 --> 02:47:58.334
THAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT PEOPLE

02:47:58.401 --> 02:48:00.403
ARE NOT GOING TO BE ACCESSING

02:48:00.470 --> 02:48:02.672
CARE. THERE IS ALSO THE BROADER

02:48:02.739 --> 02:48:04.741
ISSUE OF THE IMPACT THAT THAT

02:48:04.808 --> 02:48:07.644
NOT HAVING PEOPLE ACCESS CARE

02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:09.746
WILL HAVE ON THOSE HEALTH CARE

02:48:09.813 --> 02:48:14.751
CLINICS WHO ARE LARGELY. FUNDED

02:48:14.818 --> 02:48:18.488
THROUGH THEIR SERVICE LEVELS AND

02:48:18.555 --> 02:48:19.956
SERVICE PROVISION TO PEOPLE WHO

02:48:20.023 --> 02:48:23.426
ARE ON, ON MEDI-CAL. SO WHEN OUR

02:48:23.493 --> 02:48:24.961
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE

02:48:25.028 --> 02:48:26.696
FEARFUL TO GET HEALTHCARE, IT

02:48:26.763 --> 02:48:28.064
NOT ONLY MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:48:28.131 --> 02:48:29.165
GETTING HEALTHCARE, BUT IT ALSO

02:48:29.232 --> 02:48:31.067
MEANS THAT WE ARE IN THIS VERY

02:48:31.134 --> 02:48:32.402
TERRIBLE CYCLE OF NOT HAVING THE

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:33.536
ABILITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE

02:48:33.603 --> 02:48:35.572
PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:37.841
THAT CARE. SO DOCTOR PATEL IN

02:48:37.907 --> 02:48:39.375
PARTICULAR, CAN YOU SPEAK TO

02:48:39.442 --> 02:48:41.511
THAT ASPECT OF THE IMPACT OF

02:48:41.578 --> 02:48:44.581
THESE ICE RAIDS ON, ON OUR

02:48:44.647 --> 02:48:46.416
COMMUNITIES, HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS?

02:48:46.483 --> 02:48:48.751
IT IS IT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR

02:48:48.818 --> 02:48:52.555
ME TO SPEAK TO THE SORT OF

02:48:52.622 --> 02:48:54.724
FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THOSE

02:48:54.791 --> 02:48:57.560
CLINICS. MANY OF THEM HAVE A

02:48:57.627 --> 02:49:00.563
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODEL OF

02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:01.931
REIMBURSEMENT THAN WE DO. IF

02:49:01.998 --> 02:49:03.399
THEY'RE DOING FEE FOR SERVICE,

02:49:03.466 --> 02:49:04.567
THEN ABSOLUTELY, THEY'RE GOING

02:49:04.634 --> 02:49:07.103
TO BE IMPACTED FOR US. MANY OF

02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:08.972
OUR PATIENTS ARE EMPANELED AND

02:49:09.038 --> 02:49:10.240
WE ARE THEIR, YOU KNOW, THEIR

02:49:10.306 --> 02:49:12.008
MEDI-CAL HEALTH PLAN CAPITATED.

02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:14.110
SO WE GET PAID SORT OF ON A

02:49:14.177 --> 02:49:16.379
MONTHLY BASIS TO CARE FOR THEM,

02:49:16.446 --> 02:49:17.747
BUT CERTAINLY OTHER PEOPLE FOR

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:20.683
WHOM THEY'RE THEY'RE ON OTHER

02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:23.286
INSURANCE PLANS OR OTHER FEE FOR

02:49:23.353 --> 02:49:27.190
SERVICE PLANS. THERE CAN BE AN

02:49:27.257 --> 02:49:29.058
IMPACT. THE OTHER THING I WOULD

02:49:29.125 --> 02:49:30.493
LIKE TO SAY ABOUT RESOURCES, IF

02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:36.866
I MAY, IS THAT, YOU KNOW, MY DAY

02:49:36.933 --> 02:49:39.269
JOB, SO TO SPEAK, MY REGULAR THE

02:49:39.335 --> 02:49:42.906
PRIMARY PART OF MY JOB IS, IS AS

02:49:42.972 --> 02:49:45.542
THE CHIEF OF PATIENT SAFETY FOR

02:49:45.608 --> 02:49:47.277
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

02:49:47.343 --> 02:49:49.412
SERVICES. THAT MEANS THAT MY

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:51.180
PRIMARY ROLE IS TO MAKE SURE

02:49:51.247 --> 02:49:52.982
THAT WE PROVIDE SAFE, HIGH

02:49:53.049 --> 02:49:55.518
QUALITY CARE AND THAT WE DON'T

02:49:55.585 --> 02:49:56.953
HARM OUR PATIENTS WHEN WE'RE

02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:59.889
CARING FOR THEM. IN TIMES LIKE

02:49:59.956 --> 02:50:01.357
THIS, I ALSO PICK UP EXTRA

02:50:01.424 --> 02:50:03.126
ROLES, LIKE BEING THE

02:50:03.192 --> 02:50:04.928
DEPARTMENT'S IMMIGRATION AFFAIRS

02:50:04.994 --> 02:50:08.531
LIAISON WHEN OUR STAFF, WHEN OUR

02:50:08.598 --> 02:50:10.633
LEADERSHIP ARE FOCUSED ON TRYING

02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:12.468
TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PATIENTS

02:50:12.535 --> 02:50:15.338
AND OUR STAFF FEEL SAFE TO

02:50:15.405 --> 02:50:19.342
RECEIVE CARE, TO PROVIDE CARE,

02:50:19.409 --> 02:50:20.743
AND THAT WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION

02:50:20.810 --> 02:50:23.546
TO THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO

02:50:23.613 --> 02:50:25.348
TO PREPARE FOR POTENTIAL VISITS

02:50:25.415 --> 02:50:27.984
FROM ICE. THAT TAKES US AWAY

02:50:28.051 --> 02:50:30.119
FROM OUR KEY MISSION OF

02:50:30.186 --> 02:50:31.254
PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE TO

02:50:31.321 --> 02:50:33.856
OUR PATIENTS. SO THERE'S A DRAIN

02:50:33.923 --> 02:50:36.292
ON RESOURCE THAT IS NOT ONLY

02:50:36.359 --> 02:50:38.394
MONETARY, BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF

02:50:38.461 --> 02:50:40.797
TAKING PEOPLE'S TIME AWAY FROM

02:50:40.863 --> 02:50:44.734
THEIR PRIMARY WORK. I APPRECIATE

02:50:44.801 --> 02:50:46.002
THAT, AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE

02:50:46.069 --> 02:50:47.270
SEVERAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION

02:50:47.337 --> 02:50:49.572
THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED THAT

02:50:49.639 --> 02:50:54.644
CHIRLA IS A SPONSOR OF TO REALLY

02:50:54.711 --> 02:50:55.645
LOOK AT CREATING DIFFERENT

02:50:55.712 --> 02:50:58.147
LEVELS OF SAFETY OR SENSE OF

02:50:58.214 --> 02:50:59.983
SAFETY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:51:00.049 --> 02:51:02.218
SEEKING CARE, GOING THROUGH THE

02:51:02.285 --> 02:51:03.319
LEGISLATURE. I KNOW SENATOR

02:51:03.386 --> 02:51:04.687
ARAGON HAS ONE PIECE OF

02:51:04.754 --> 02:51:06.122
LEGISLATION. I'M SURE THERE ARE

02:51:06.189 --> 02:51:09.092
OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS.

02:51:09.158 --> 02:51:10.760
HAVING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

02:51:10.827 --> 02:51:13.329
UNDERSTAND HOW TO BE ABLE TO

02:51:13.396 --> 02:51:16.232
CREATE SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:51:16.299 --> 02:51:18.334
PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE. I KNOW THAT

02:51:18.401 --> 02:51:20.503
WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL ON THE

02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:22.338
ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND DATA

02:51:22.405 --> 02:51:26.676
SHARING PIECES, BUT I DID WANT

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:28.378
TO JUST ASK YOU ALL FROM YOUR

02:51:28.444 --> 02:51:30.947
PERSPECTIVE. THERE WERE RECENT

02:51:31.014 --> 02:51:34.584
PART OF THE FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT

02:51:34.651 --> 02:51:36.786
ACTIONS, NOT ONLY INCLUDED

02:51:36.853 --> 02:51:38.154
INCLUDE THE ON THE STREET, WHAT

02:51:38.221 --> 02:51:41.691
IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF ICE

02:51:41.758 --> 02:51:42.659
AGENTS SHOWING UP, BUT IT ALSO

02:51:42.725 --> 02:51:47.130
IMPACTED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

02:51:47.196 --> 02:51:50.099
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF HOMELAND

02:51:50.166 --> 02:51:53.603
SECURITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO DATA

02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:56.572
FROM CMS, THE FEDERAL CMS. THAT

02:51:56.639 --> 02:51:58.641
WAS KIND OF A KNOWN THING THAT

02:51:58.708 --> 02:51:59.876
HAPPENED. VERY TERRIFYING FOR A

02:51:59.942 --> 02:52:02.278
LOT OF INDIVIDUALS. CAN YOU ALL

02:52:02.345 --> 02:52:05.481
SPEAK TO THAT ASPECT OF THE

02:52:05.548 --> 02:52:08.051
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:10.920
ACTIONS ON, ON, ON THE

02:52:10.987 --> 02:52:12.055
INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE

02:52:12.121 --> 02:52:14.924
EITHER SEEKING CARE OR IMPACT ON

02:52:14.991 --> 02:52:19.595
PROVIDERS? AGAIN, IN ADDITION

02:52:19.662 --> 02:52:21.330
TO, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE'VE SAID,

02:52:21.397 --> 02:52:22.832
WHAT I'VE SAID BEFORE AND WHAT I

02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:24.033
THINK THE OTHERS HAVE SAID AS

02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:26.769
WELL, RIGHT, THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:52:26.836 --> 02:52:27.270
VERY APPREHENSIVE. I WAS

02:52:27.336 --> 02:52:29.338
SPEAKING TO ONE OF OUR HEALTH

02:52:29.405 --> 02:52:30.073
PLAN PARTNERS THIS MORNING WHO

02:52:30.139 --> 02:52:32.709
REPORTED THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE

02:52:32.775 --> 02:52:34.243
THEY THEY PERCEIVE APPREHENSION

02:52:34.310 --> 02:52:36.946
AND THEY GET REPORTS OF PEOPLE

02:52:37.013 --> 02:52:40.083
BEING UNWILLING TO ENROLL, EVEN

02:52:40.149 --> 02:52:41.551
FOR BENEFITS THAT THEY ARE

02:52:41.617 --> 02:52:44.487
ELIGIBLE FOR, BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:52:44.554 --> 02:52:46.656
AFRAID THAT THIS MAY BE

02:52:46.723 --> 02:52:49.125
INFORMATION THAT SORT OF FLOWS

02:52:49.192 --> 02:52:50.560
DOWNSTREAM, MAY IMPACT THEIR

02:52:50.626 --> 02:52:54.964
FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL. SO WE'RE

02:52:55.031 --> 02:52:56.699
HEARING A LOT OF FEARS FROM

02:52:56.766 --> 02:52:58.901
COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF APPLYING

02:52:58.968 --> 02:53:01.471
FOR MEDICAL FOR MEDI-CAL. WHEN

02:53:01.537 --> 02:53:02.805
WE WERE INITIALLY TELLING

02:53:02.872 --> 02:53:05.041
PEOPLE, THIS CAP IS COMING,

02:53:05.108 --> 02:53:06.809
APPLY NOW. NOW WE'RE HAVING TO

02:53:06.876 --> 02:53:08.444
PIVOT AND LET THEM KNOW YOU

02:53:08.511 --> 02:53:10.012
CAN'T APPLY NOW. YOU SHOULD

02:53:10.079 --> 02:53:11.013
APPLY NOW IF YOU WANT TO GET

02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:13.549
MEDI-CAL, BUT THEN ALSO LET THEM

02:53:13.616 --> 02:53:14.650
KNOW THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

02:53:14.717 --> 02:53:15.852
AND THIS IS YOUR RIGHT. THESE

02:53:15.918 --> 02:53:17.987
ARE YOUR RIGHTS. WE DO KNOW THAT

02:53:18.054 --> 02:53:20.423
THERE ARE LAWSUITS ABOUT THE

02:53:20.490 --> 02:53:22.391
DATA LEAK THAT ARE GOING THAT

02:53:22.458 --> 02:53:25.161
ARE ONGOING. AND THEN ALSO WE'RE

02:53:25.228 --> 02:53:26.529
WE HAVE LIKE WEEKLY CHECK INS

02:53:26.596 --> 02:53:28.664
WITH ALTAMED. AND THEY'RE

02:53:28.731 --> 02:53:29.766
CONSTANTLY TELLING US THAT LIKE

02:53:29.832 --> 02:53:33.002
PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL TO GO OUT AND

02:53:33.069 --> 02:53:35.605
HOW MUCH THIS HAS HURT, LIKE HOW

02:53:35.671 --> 02:53:37.707
MUCH HURT THAT THIS HAS DONE TO

02:53:37.774 --> 02:53:39.242
THE COMMUNITY. AND I WOULD SAY

02:53:39.308 --> 02:53:40.576
IN RESPONSE TO YOUR PREVIOUS

02:53:40.643 --> 02:53:42.411
QUESTION, RIGHT, THAT THAT SORT

02:53:42.478 --> 02:53:44.881
OF REMINDS ME THAT A LOT OF EDS

02:53:44.947 --> 02:53:47.784
LIKE OURS SEE, PATIENTS WHO MAY

02:53:47.850 --> 02:53:49.285
NOT HAVE COVERAGE, MAY BE

02:53:49.352 --> 02:53:50.753
AVAILABLE, MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:53:50.820 --> 02:53:52.488
EMERGENCY COVERAGE AT PRESENT.

02:53:52.555 --> 02:53:54.590
AND IF THEY'RE AFRAID TO ENROLL

02:53:54.657 --> 02:53:58.027
FOR IT OR IF IT THEY BECOME NO

02:53:58.094 --> 02:53:59.762
LONGER ELIGIBLE THROUGH ALL OF

02:53:59.829 --> 02:54:01.397
THE EFFECTS THAT H.R. ONE HAS,

02:54:01.464 --> 02:54:03.266
THAT WILL BE A DECREASE IN

02:54:03.332 --> 02:54:06.769
REVENUE FOR THOSE HOSPITALS.

02:54:06.836 --> 02:54:08.304
ABSOLUTELY. I'LL JUST ADD THAT

02:54:08.371 --> 02:54:10.506
THE FACT THAT THE DATA SHARING

02:54:10.573 --> 02:54:14.043
COST IS, IS, IS, IS EVEN BEYOND

02:54:14.110 --> 02:54:15.578
ENROLLING IN MEDI-CAL, RIGHT? SO

02:54:15.645 --> 02:54:18.114
IT'S EVEN ACCESSING CRITICAL

02:54:18.181 --> 02:54:20.650
SERVICES LIKE WICK GOING TO HEAD

02:54:20.716 --> 02:54:22.218
START. THERE'S NOW FEAR THAT

02:54:22.285 --> 02:54:24.120
HEAD START HAS TO START

02:54:24.187 --> 02:54:25.655
COLLECTING CERTAIN INFORMATION

02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:28.457
IN ORDER TO ENROLL FAMILIES AND

02:54:28.524 --> 02:54:29.926
ALL KINDS OF CRITICAL SERVICE,

02:54:29.992 --> 02:54:32.094
YOU KNOW, DENTAL CARE, MENTAL

02:54:32.161 --> 02:54:34.130
HEALTH SERVICES, ALL OF THOSE

02:54:34.197 --> 02:54:36.599
THINGS ARE CONNECTED TO THAT

02:54:36.666 --> 02:54:38.568
CHILL THAT THAT THAT HAPPENS

02:54:38.634 --> 02:54:40.336
WHEN PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY'RE

02:54:40.403 --> 02:54:41.504
UNSAFE IN SHARING THEIR

02:54:41.571 --> 02:54:42.305
INFORMATION OR THAT IT'S GOING

02:54:42.371 --> 02:54:44.707
TO BE USED AGAINST THEM. VERY

02:54:44.774 --> 02:54:47.310
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN

02:54:47.376 --> 02:54:49.345
THE PAST AROUND THE PUBLIC

02:54:49.412 --> 02:54:53.649
CHARGE RULE. SENATOR DOCTOR

02:54:53.716 --> 02:54:58.354
WEBER. THANK YOU. CHAIR. THANK

02:54:58.421 --> 02:54:59.589
WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR

02:54:59.655 --> 02:55:01.324
BEING HERE. I WANTED TO KIND OF

02:55:01.390 --> 02:55:05.528
PIGGYBACK ON A POINT THAT

02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:09.165
SENATOR BROUGHT UP AROUND THE

02:55:09.232 --> 02:55:11.701
DATA THAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO,

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:14.570
DOCTOR PATEL, AND THE FACT THAT

02:55:14.637 --> 02:55:16.806
YOU'VE SEEN A DECREASE IN THE

02:55:16.873 --> 02:55:18.241
NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THE

02:55:18.307 --> 02:55:20.776
EMERGENCY ROOMS AND URGENT CARES

02:55:20.843 --> 02:55:22.044
AND THE ISSUE AROUND

02:55:22.111 --> 02:55:24.714
PREVENTATIVE CARE, MAYBE TOO

02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:27.016
EARLY TO HAVE THIS DATA THAT I'M

02:55:27.083 --> 02:55:29.018
GETTING READY TO TALK ABOUT, BUT

02:55:29.085 --> 02:55:30.853
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT IS A

02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:32.321
PART OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT

02:55:32.388 --> 02:55:33.022
YOU'RE COLLECTING. AND THAT

02:55:33.089 --> 02:55:36.158
WOULD BE EVEN IF YOU HAVE A

02:55:36.225 --> 02:55:36.692
DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

02:55:36.759 --> 02:55:37.360
PATIENTS SHOWING UP TO THE

02:55:37.426 --> 02:55:39.795
EMERGENCY ROOMS OR URGENT CARES,

02:55:39.862 --> 02:55:41.397
ARE YOU SEEING AN INCREASE IN

02:55:41.464 --> 02:55:44.800
THE NUMBER OF EMERGENT DIAGNOSES

02:55:44.867 --> 02:55:46.736
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MANAGED?

02:55:46.802 --> 02:55:47.570
PREVENTIVELY. SO, FOR EXAMPLE,

02:55:47.637 --> 02:55:48.871
ARE YOU SEEING AN INCREASE IN

02:55:48.938 --> 02:55:50.172
THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS COMING IN

02:55:50.239 --> 02:55:52.842
WITH LIKE DKA OR WITH

02:55:52.909 --> 02:55:53.843
HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY OR

02:55:53.910 --> 02:55:55.378
EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT COULD

02:55:55.444 --> 02:55:57.413
HAVE BEEN MANAGED?

02:55:57.480 --> 02:55:59.015
PREVENTATIVELY? I THINK THAT'S

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:00.416
AN EXCELLENT QUESTION, AND ONE

02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:02.118
I'VE WONDERED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:56:02.184 --> 02:56:03.219
MYSELF. WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA

02:56:03.286 --> 02:56:06.022
ON IT YET, BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO

02:56:06.088 --> 02:56:07.323
LOOK INTO SEE IF WE CAN GET

02:56:07.390 --> 02:56:12.261
THAT. THANK YOU. WAS THAT

02:56:12.328 --> 02:56:16.632
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS? YES. TINY

02:56:16.699 --> 02:56:22.305
EMT KNOWLEDGE. TINY. OKAY,

02:56:22.371 --> 02:56:24.407
GREAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO

02:56:24.473 --> 02:56:26.208
MUCH I APPRECIATE IT. I THINK I

02:56:26.275 --> 02:56:27.510
THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT

02:56:27.576 --> 02:56:29.478
FOR US TO DO THIS INTERSECTION

02:56:29.545 --> 02:56:30.813
BETWEEN WHAT IS HAPPENING AND

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:32.648
THEN IT REALLY PUTTING THE

02:56:32.715 --> 02:56:34.951
PUBLIC HEALTH LENS UNDER IT. I

02:56:35.017 --> 02:56:36.118
KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:56:36.185 --> 02:56:39.288
HAVE ONGOING LONG TERM IMPACTS,

02:56:39.355 --> 02:56:41.390
BOTH TO THE CHILDREN OF FAMILIES

02:56:41.457 --> 02:56:43.459
DETAINED AND TO THOSE DETAINED

02:56:43.526 --> 02:56:45.962
AS WELL, ESPECIALLY. I MEAN, WE

02:56:46.028 --> 02:56:47.897
HEARD STORIES LAST WEEK DURING A

02:56:47.964 --> 02:56:49.498
ROUNDTABLE OF PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO

02:56:49.565 --> 02:56:51.934
WERE DETAINED, MISSING CHEMO

02:56:52.001 --> 02:56:55.071
APPOINTMENTS. SO JUST THEIR

02:56:55.137 --> 02:56:56.038
DIAGNOSIS DETERIORATING WHILE

02:56:56.105 --> 02:56:58.140
BEING DETAINED WITH BECAUSE THEY

02:56:58.207 --> 02:56:59.408
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR

02:56:59.475 --> 02:57:01.944
HEALTHCARE NEEDS. SO ONGOING OR

02:57:02.011 --> 02:57:03.179
WOMEN WHO ARE BEING DETAINED

02:57:03.245 --> 02:57:05.181
RIGHT NOW ARE NOT BEING GIVEN

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:07.283
FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS DURING

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:09.852
DAYS AND DAYS AND WEEKS OF

02:57:09.919 --> 02:57:11.787
DETAINMENT. SO THERE IS A PUBLIC

IMPORTANT. WE THOUGHT IT WAS

MEDICAL, DENTAL, BEHAVIORAL

02:58:19.789 --> 02:58:22.725
HEALTH SERVICES. WE HAVE 28

02:58:22.792 --> 02:58:25.227
CLINIC SITES AND FIVE MOBILES.

02:58:25.294 --> 02:58:27.696
STREET MEDICINE TEAM, A LARGE

02:58:27.763 --> 02:58:28.597
TRANSGENDER HEALTH PROGRAM. AND

02:58:28.664 --> 02:58:31.400
WE'RE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:33.235
SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED

02:58:33.302 --> 02:58:36.472
IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY. OUR

02:58:36.539 --> 02:58:38.441
PATIENTS ARE FACING A DELUGE OF

02:58:38.507 --> 02:58:40.276
ATTACKS. WE SPOKE EARLIER IN

02:58:40.342 --> 02:58:42.111
THIS HEARING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

02:58:42.178 --> 02:58:45.381
THE ICE RAIDS. NOT SO DRAMATIC,

02:58:45.448 --> 02:58:47.583
BUT EQUALLY AS CHILLING FOR OUR

02:58:47.650 --> 02:58:49.351
PATIENTS WERE THE RECENT MOVES

02:58:49.418 --> 02:58:51.187
OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO

02:58:51.253 --> 02:58:53.255
REDEFINE AND BROADEN THE

02:58:53.322 --> 02:58:55.191
DEFINITION OF PUBLIC CHARGE AND

02:58:55.257 --> 02:58:56.959
THE EXCHANGE OF PRIVATE HEALTH

02:58:57.026 --> 02:58:58.427
DATA IN THE MEDI-CAL SYSTEM WITH

02:58:58.494 --> 02:59:00.529
IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES. THIS IS

02:59:00.596 --> 02:59:02.965
HAVING A PROFOUND IMPACT ON

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:04.733
ACCESS TO CARE FOR OUR TENS OF

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:07.336
THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS. IN THE

02:59:07.403 --> 02:59:09.371
LAST MONTH, HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS

02:59:09.438 --> 02:59:12.341
ARE DECLINING TO RE ENROLL INTO

02:59:12.408 --> 02:59:14.176
MEDI-CAL FOR FEAR OF PUBLIC

02:59:14.243 --> 02:59:17.146
CHARGE. OUR CALL CENTER WAS

02:59:17.213 --> 02:59:18.914
INUNDATED WITH CALLS FROM

02:59:18.981 --> 02:59:21.150
IMMIGRATION IMMIGRANT PATIENTS

02:59:21.217 --> 02:59:22.551
ASKING IF THEIR NAMES AND

02:59:22.618 --> 02:59:25.087
ADDRESSES WERE SHARED WITH ICE.

02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:26.288
ONE DAY LAST WEEK ALONE, THERE

02:59:26.355 --> 02:59:28.591
WERE OVER 800 CALLS TO OUR CALL

02:59:28.657 --> 02:59:31.360
CENTER ASKING THAT QUESTION.

02:59:31.427 --> 02:59:33.062
SINCE THE IMMIGRATION RAIDS AND

02:59:33.129 --> 02:59:34.730
THE INFORMATION ABOUT FEDERAL

02:59:34.797 --> 02:59:36.899
ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES ON NO

02:59:36.966 --> 02:59:40.035
SHOW RATES AND APPOINTMENTS HAVE

02:59:40.102 --> 02:59:43.305
TRIPLED, GOING FROM 9% OF OUR

02:59:43.372 --> 02:59:44.940
PATIENTS MISSING THEIR

02:59:45.007 --> 02:59:48.144
APPOINTMENTS TO OVER 31%. AS THE

02:59:48.210 --> 02:59:49.879
RAIDS HAVE DISSIPATED A LITTLE

02:59:49.945 --> 02:59:52.681
BIT, THAT IS THE NO SHOW RATE IS

02:59:52.748 --> 02:59:53.749
DECLINING AGAIN, BUT IT'S STILL

02:59:53.816 --> 02:59:56.385
HIGHER THAN IT WAS BEFORE. WE

02:59:56.452 --> 02:59:58.454
CALLED OUR PATIENTS TO FIND OUT.

02:59:58.521 --> 03:00:00.723
WE HAVE ABOUT 25,000

03:00:00.789 --> 03:00:01.657
UNDOCUMENTED PATIENTS. WE CALLED

03:00:01.724 --> 03:00:04.193
THEM TO ASK THEM WHY THEY DIDN'T

03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:05.728
COME, AND THEY SAID THEY WERE

03:00:05.794 --> 03:00:08.264
AFRAID TO COME BECAUSE OF ICE.

03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:10.099
SO WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM CALLED

03:00:10.166 --> 03:00:12.067
HEALTHCARE WITHOUT FEAR, WHERE

03:00:12.134 --> 03:00:15.104
WE SEND DOCTORS AND NURSES AND

03:00:15.171 --> 03:00:17.273
MEDICAL ASSISTANTS TO THE HOMES

03:00:17.339 --> 03:00:19.008
OF OUR PATIENTS TO PROVIDE ON

03:00:19.074 --> 03:00:21.177
SITE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE'RE

03:00:21.243 --> 03:00:23.312
ALSO DELIVERING THEIR MEDICINE.

03:00:23.379 --> 03:00:25.147
AND WE ALSO FOUND THAT MANY

03:00:25.214 --> 03:00:26.849
FAMILIES WERE AFRAID TO GO TO

03:00:26.916 --> 03:00:28.083
THE GROCERY STORE OR DIDN'T HAVE

03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:30.152
MONEY TO BUY FOOD. SO OUR

03:00:30.219 --> 03:00:31.587
DOCTORS ARE BRINGING BAGS OF

03:00:31.654 --> 03:00:33.656
GROCERIES WITH THEM AS WELL.

03:00:33.722 --> 03:00:37.760
WE'VE SEEN CLOSE TO 600 PATIENTS

03:00:37.826 --> 03:00:40.796
SO FAR IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS

03:00:40.863 --> 03:00:41.430
IN THIS HEALTHCARE WITHOUT FEAR

03:00:41.497 --> 03:00:45.301
PROGRAM. WE'RE ALSO SEEING A LOT

03:00:45.367 --> 03:00:48.204
OF PATIENTS WHOSE CHRONIC

03:00:48.270 --> 03:00:49.305
DISEASES AND OTHER HEALTH

03:00:49.371 --> 03:00:50.406
CONDITIONS ARE GETTING

03:00:50.472 --> 03:00:53.609
SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE AS A RESULT.

03:00:53.676 --> 03:00:55.010
ONE OF OUR PATIENTS, WE HAVE

03:00:55.077 --> 03:00:58.581
DIABETES CLASSES THAT PROVIDE

03:00:58.647 --> 03:01:00.783
EXERCISE AND FITNESS COMMUNITY,

03:01:00.849 --> 03:01:02.184
AND WE HAVE DEMONSTRATION

03:01:02.251 --> 03:01:03.819
KITCHENS TO TEACH PATIENTS HOW

03:01:03.886 --> 03:01:05.221
TO COOK THEIR FAVORITE FOODS

03:01:05.287 --> 03:01:07.590
WITH HEALTHY INGREDIENTS. ONE OF

03:01:07.656 --> 03:01:09.758
OUR PATIENTS WHO'VE BEEN HAS

03:01:09.825 --> 03:01:11.193
BEEN COMING TO THIS DIABETES

03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:13.362
CLASS FOR YEARS. HER HEALTH HAS

03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:15.164
GOTTEN SO GOOD THAT THE DOCTOR

03:01:15.231 --> 03:01:17.399
IS WAS ABOUT TO TAKE HER OFF.

03:01:17.466 --> 03:01:20.202
HER MEDICINE WAS UNDOCUMENTED

03:01:20.269 --> 03:01:22.404
AND WAS AFRAID TO COME IN FOR A

03:01:22.471 --> 03:01:23.973
VISIT. WE CONTACTED HER, VISITED

03:01:24.039 --> 03:01:27.042
HER HOME. SHE HER BLOOD SUGAR

03:01:27.109 --> 03:01:28.877
LEVEL WAS LITERALLY ON THE

03:01:28.944 --> 03:01:30.613
VERGE, WAS HIGH ENOUGH FOR HER

03:01:30.679 --> 03:01:32.548
TO BE ON THE VERGE OF A DIABETIC

03:01:32.615 --> 03:01:36.151
COMA, AND WE ASKED HER WHAT HAD

03:01:36.218 --> 03:01:36.752
HAPPENED BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN

03:01:36.819 --> 03:01:38.287
DOING SO, SO WELL, AND SHE

03:01:38.354 --> 03:01:39.989
SHARED THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

03:01:40.055 --> 03:01:42.291
FOOD, AND THAT FOR THE LAST

03:01:42.358 --> 03:01:43.759
EIGHT DAYS SHE'D ONLY EATEN

03:01:43.826 --> 03:01:46.595
TORTILLAS AND DRANK COFFEE. SO

03:01:46.662 --> 03:01:48.097
THIS IS THE KINDS OF THESE ARE

03:01:48.163 --> 03:01:49.565
THE KINDS OF SITUATIONS THAT

03:01:49.632 --> 03:01:51.533
WE'RE SEEING. AND IN THE MIDST

03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:53.002
OF ALL THIS, OUR STREET MEDICINE

03:01:53.068 --> 03:01:54.803
TEAM WAS AT MACARTHUR PARK A

03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:56.272
COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK WHEN ICE

03:01:56.338 --> 03:01:59.141
MADE THE PSEUDO MILITARY

03:01:59.208 --> 03:02:02.311
OPERATION. THEY SHUT DOWN OUR

03:02:02.378 --> 03:02:04.847
STREET MEDICINE PROGRAM,

03:02:04.913 --> 03:02:06.649
THREATENED OUR PATIENTS, AND PUT

03:02:06.715 --> 03:02:08.550
MACHINE GUNS IN THE FACE OF OUR

03:02:08.617 --> 03:02:10.586
DOCTORS AND MEDICAL ASSISTANTS

03:02:10.653 --> 03:02:17.426
AND FORCED THEM TO LEAVE. SO.

03:02:17.493 --> 03:02:19.361
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

03:02:19.428 --> 03:02:22.064
ON THE GROUND. AND I WANT TO BE

03:02:22.131 --> 03:02:24.967
HONEST HERE TODAY, I THINK WHAT

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:26.502
WE'RE REALLY NOT TALKING ABOUT

03:02:26.568 --> 03:02:29.438
IS THE IMPACT THAT THE STATE

03:02:29.505 --> 03:02:32.675
CUTS ARE GOING TO HAVE ON THE

03:02:32.741 --> 03:02:35.110
COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. THE

03:02:35.177 --> 03:02:37.379
STATE CUTS ARE ACTUALLY THREE

03:02:37.446 --> 03:02:40.149
TIMES AS AS BAD AS THE FEDERAL

03:02:40.215 --> 03:02:42.084
CUTS. THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE

03:02:42.151 --> 03:02:44.253
WILL LOSE THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE.

03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:47.690
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

03:02:47.756 --> 03:02:50.492
PROPOSAL THAT STARTS IN JULY

03:02:50.559 --> 03:02:54.830
THAT WOULD CUT 80% OF THE

03:02:54.897 --> 03:02:57.366
FUNDING OF THE RATE THAT FQHCS

03:02:57.433 --> 03:02:58.867
NONPROFIT HEALTH PROVIDERS

03:02:58.934 --> 03:03:01.437
RECEIVE, WE SERVE THE MAJORITY

03:03:01.503 --> 03:03:03.439
OF UNDOCUMENTED PATIENTS IN

03:03:03.505 --> 03:03:04.907
CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

03:03:04.973 --> 03:03:08.143
ABOUT A FAMILY OF FOUR WITH

03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:12.247
MEDI-CAL INCOME ELIGIBILITY, THE

03:03:12.314 --> 03:03:16.185
HIGHEST INCOME ELIGIBILITY IS

03:03:16.251 --> 03:03:18.220
$2,600 A MONTH FOR A FAMILY OF

03:03:18.287 --> 03:03:19.355
FOUR. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:03:19.421 --> 03:03:23.759
A STUDIO APARTMENT FOR 1900

03:03:23.826 --> 03:03:25.828
AVERAGE IN LA AND YOU'RE TALKING

03:03:25.894 --> 03:03:27.730
ABOUT NOW THAT PATIENT HAVING TO

03:03:27.796 --> 03:03:33.202
PAY $30 PER PERSON, $120 A MONTH

03:03:33.268 --> 03:03:36.438
TO KEEP THEIR MEDI-CAL, THEY'RE

03:03:36.505 --> 03:03:39.575
NOT GOING TO PAY IT. AND SO WHAT

03:03:39.641 --> 03:03:42.811
WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IS THAT WHILE

03:03:42.878 --> 03:03:44.546
OUR FAMILIES ARE FACING THESE

03:03:44.613 --> 03:03:45.948
ATTACKS FROM THE FEDERAL

03:03:46.014 --> 03:03:48.183
GOVERNMENT, THEY'RE FACING THESE

03:03:48.250 --> 03:03:50.018
RAIDS, THEY'RE FACING THESE

03:03:50.085 --> 03:03:51.453
ADMINISTRATIVE SITUATIONS,

03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:52.821
THEY'RE FACING THESE INCREASING

03:03:52.888 --> 03:03:55.124
CUTS IN THE FEDERAL MEDICAID

03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:59.328
PROGRAM. AND AT THE SAME TIME,

03:03:59.395 --> 03:04:01.096
THE STATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY

03:04:01.163 --> 03:04:03.665
CUTTING THEIR ACCESS TO MEDI-CAL

03:04:03.732 --> 03:04:06.535
AND IS DECIMATING NONPROFIT,

03:04:06.602 --> 03:04:07.336
FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH

03:04:07.403 --> 03:04:10.139
CENTERS IN THE PROCESS. SO I

03:04:10.205 --> 03:04:12.274
REALLY WOULD URGE THAT WE

03:04:12.341 --> 03:04:14.510
CONSIDER A REVENUE OPTION RATHER

03:04:14.576 --> 03:04:18.414
THAN CUTS. IF WE JUST INSTITUTE

03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:20.549
TAXES ON THE BILLIONAIRES WHO

03:04:20.616 --> 03:04:23.452
GOT A TAX BREAKS UNDER TRUMP'S

03:04:23.519 --> 03:04:26.255
LAW, WE COULD BRING IN TENS OF

03:04:26.321 --> 03:04:27.856
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE

03:04:27.923 --> 03:04:30.526
GENERAL FUND AND LITERALLY AVOID

03:04:30.592 --> 03:04:32.594
ALL THE CUTS AND, IN FACT,

03:04:32.661 --> 03:04:34.229
BACKFILL ALL THE CUTS COMING

03:04:34.296 --> 03:04:36.365
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND

03:04:36.432 --> 03:04:37.733
SO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:39.401
WOULD NOT FEEL ANY OF THE

03:04:39.468 --> 03:04:41.804
EFFECTS OF THE BIG UGLY BILL.

03:04:41.870 --> 03:04:43.439
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

03:04:43.505 --> 03:04:44.940
INDULGING ME AND FOR ALLOWING

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:46.241
SAINT JOHN'S TO BE HERE TODAY.

03:04:46.308 --> 03:04:49.111
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH,

CARLOS. HELLO, CHAIRS. MEMBERS.

03:04:54.683 --> 03:04:56.318
MY NAME IS CARLOS ALARCON AND I

03:04:56.385 --> 03:04:58.320
AM A HEALTH POLICY ANALYST WITH

03:04:58.387 --> 03:04:59.621
THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:01.590
CENTER. FOR MORE THAN A DECADE,

03:05:01.657 --> 03:05:04.293
CIPC HAS BEEN PROUD TO CO-LEAD

03:05:04.359 --> 03:05:05.828
THE HEALTH FOR ALL COALITION,

03:05:05.894 --> 03:05:07.396
WHICH HAS BEEN THE MAIN DRIVING

03:05:07.463 --> 03:05:09.498
FORCE TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE OUR

03:05:09.565 --> 03:05:12.100
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO INCLUDE ALL

03:05:12.167 --> 03:05:13.135
CALIFORNIANS, REGARDLESS OF

03:05:13.202 --> 03:05:15.270
IMMIGRATION STATUS. OUR

03:05:15.337 --> 03:05:16.672
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN

03:05:16.738 --> 03:05:18.974
DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE IMPACTS

03:05:19.041 --> 03:05:21.076
OF THE PASSAGE OF H.R. ONE.

03:05:21.143 --> 03:05:22.578
TODAY, I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE

03:05:22.644 --> 03:05:24.680
IMPACTS ON PUBLIC CHARGE,

03:05:24.746 --> 03:05:25.581
CONCERNS THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM

03:05:25.647 --> 03:05:28.016
OUR COMMUNITY ON THE GROUND, AND

03:05:28.083 --> 03:05:30.819
WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT DATA

03:05:30.886 --> 03:05:32.321
SHARING WITH DEPARTMENT OF

03:05:32.387 --> 03:05:34.356
HOMELAND SECURITY AND ICE,

03:05:34.423 --> 03:05:36.124
STARTING WITH PUBLIC CHARGE.

03:05:36.191 --> 03:05:38.360
THIS IS A TEST APPLIED WHEN

03:05:38.427 --> 03:05:39.761
IMMIGRANTS SEEK TO ADJUST THEIR

03:05:39.828 --> 03:05:42.731
STATUS. DURING THIS EVALUATION,

03:05:42.798 --> 03:05:44.433
A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, AN

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:45.501
IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL, DECIDES

03:05:45.567 --> 03:05:46.668
WHETHER THIS INDIVIDUAL IS

03:05:46.735 --> 03:05:48.704
LIKELY TO BECOME DEPENDENT ON

03:05:48.770 --> 03:05:51.974
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE LONG TERM.

03:05:52.040 --> 03:05:53.075
FOR PROGRAMS LIKE SUPPLEMENTAL

03:05:53.141 --> 03:05:55.310
SECURITY INCOME, TEMPORARY

03:05:55.377 --> 03:05:56.678
ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES,

03:05:56.745 --> 03:05:58.914
GENERAL ASSISTANCE SLASH RELIEF,

03:05:58.981 --> 03:06:03.218
AND MEDICAID FOR LONG TERM

03:06:03.285 --> 03:06:05.687
MEDICAL CARE IN AN INSTITUTION

03:06:05.754 --> 03:06:07.489
LIKE A NURSING HOME OR

03:06:07.556 --> 03:06:09.258
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. IF SOMEONE

03:06:09.324 --> 03:06:11.226
IS DEEMED A PUBLIC CHARGE, THEY

03:06:11.293 --> 03:06:12.995
CAN BE DENIED THE ABILITY TO

03:06:13.061 --> 03:06:15.464
ADJUST THEIR STATUS. THIS

03:06:15.531 --> 03:06:17.533
CREATES A FEAR IN IMMIGRANT

03:06:17.599 --> 03:06:19.334
COMMUNITIES FROM ACCESSING BASIC

03:06:19.401 --> 03:06:22.604
PROGRAMS. NOW, THE MAJORITY OF

03:06:22.671 --> 03:06:24.473
THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY DOES NOT

03:06:24.540 --> 03:06:26.308
QUALIFY FOR THESE PUBLIC

03:06:26.375 --> 03:06:29.077
BENEFITS TO BEGIN WITH, BUT H.R.

03:06:29.144 --> 03:06:30.879
ONE KICKS ALMOST ALL IMMIGRANTS,

03:06:30.946 --> 03:06:32.247
ALMOST ALL IMMIGRANTS WITHOUT A

03:06:32.314 --> 03:06:34.850
GREEN CARD OFF OF THE FEW

03:06:34.917 --> 03:06:36.818
BENEFITS THAT THEY DID QUALIFY

03:06:36.885 --> 03:06:39.187
FOR. NOW, THESE CHANGES REDUCE

03:06:39.254 --> 03:06:41.023
THE IMPACT THAT PUBLIC CHARGE

03:06:41.089 --> 03:06:43.559
HAS. HOWEVER, IT'S THE FEAR THAT

03:06:43.625 --> 03:06:44.626
IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITIES THE

03:06:44.693 --> 03:06:47.429
MOST. EVEN YEARS AFTER THE

03:06:47.496 --> 03:06:48.564
MEDI-CAL EDUCATION AND

03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:49.698
ENROLLMENT CAMPAIGNS THAT WE

03:06:49.765 --> 03:06:52.200
DID, THE FEAR OF PUBLIC CHARGE

03:06:52.267 --> 03:06:53.735
STILL HAUNTS OUR COMMUNITIES TO

03:06:53.802 --> 03:06:55.771
THIS DAY. AND THESE FEARS HAVE

03:06:55.837 --> 03:06:57.940
BEEN EVEN MULTIPLIED BY THE

03:06:58.006 --> 03:07:00.042
REPORTS THAT HHS IS PROVIDING

03:07:00.108 --> 03:07:01.944
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

03:07:02.010 --> 03:07:04.046
ACCESS TO THE RECORDS OF ALL

03:07:04.112 --> 03:07:05.948
PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED MEDI-CAL,

03:07:06.014 --> 03:07:08.016
EVEN IF ONLY FOR EMERGENCY

03:07:08.083 --> 03:07:09.351
SERVICES. AND TO ANSWER YOUR

03:07:09.418 --> 03:07:11.186
QUESTION FROM THE PREVIOUS

03:07:11.253 --> 03:07:12.955
PANEL, MADAM CHAIR, PEOPLE ARE

03:07:13.021 --> 03:07:15.123
SCARED. RIGHTFULLY SO. PEOPLE

03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:16.959
ARE SCARED THAT ICE WILL KNOW

03:07:17.025 --> 03:07:18.560
WHERE THEY LIVE, WILL KNOW WHERE

03:07:18.627 --> 03:07:20.228
THEY GET THEIR HEALTH CARE. THEY

03:07:20.295 --> 03:07:21.997
ARE SCARED THAT ICE WILL STALK

03:07:22.064 --> 03:07:23.699
THEIR HOMES OR THEIR HOSPITALS,

03:07:23.765 --> 03:07:25.167
AND WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE NO

03:07:25.233 --> 03:07:27.502
LONGER IN A PRIVATE AREA TO

03:07:27.569 --> 03:07:29.538
KIDNAP THEM WITHOUT A WARRANT.

03:07:29.605 --> 03:07:31.073
AT FIRST, COMMUNITY MEMBERS

03:07:31.139 --> 03:07:32.441
WOULD WEIGH THE OPTIONS OF

03:07:32.507 --> 03:07:34.543
SWITCHING FROM IN-PERSON

03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:36.078
APPOINTMENTS TO TELEHEALTH

03:07:36.144 --> 03:07:37.546
APPOINTMENTS. BUT NOW WE HAVE

03:07:37.613 --> 03:07:38.647
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE

03:07:38.714 --> 03:07:39.948
CONTACTING THEIR HEALTH CENTERS

03:07:40.015 --> 03:07:41.650
AND THEIR ENROLLER ORGANIZATIONS

03:07:41.717 --> 03:07:43.051
AND ASKING THEM TO DISENROLL

03:07:43.118 --> 03:07:45.020
THEM FROM MEDI-CAL COVERAGE,

03:07:45.087 --> 03:07:46.822
THEN THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL

03:07:46.888 --> 03:07:47.956
POTENTIALLY BE SUBJECT TO THE

03:07:48.023 --> 03:07:49.524
MEDI-CAL ENROLLMENT FREEZE IN

03:07:49.591 --> 03:07:52.327
JANUARY 1ST, 2026, MEANING THEY

03:07:52.394 --> 03:07:54.029
WILL BE FROZEN OUT THE PROGRAM

03:07:54.096 --> 03:07:55.931
ENTIRELY. WE ARE EVEN HEARING

03:07:55.998 --> 03:07:58.333
THAT SOME LATINOS WITH LAWFUL

03:07:58.400 --> 03:07:59.635
STATUS ARE QUESTIONING IF THEY

03:07:59.701 --> 03:08:01.236
SHOULD DISENROLL FROM MEDI-CAL

03:08:01.303 --> 03:08:03.038
THEMSELVES, DUE TO HOW RACIALLY

03:08:03.105 --> 03:08:04.506
TARGETED THE ICE RATES HAVE

03:08:04.573 --> 03:08:07.042
BEEN. THEY DON'T WANT ICE TO SEE

03:08:07.109 --> 03:08:08.844
A LATINO LAST NAME IN THE

03:08:08.910 --> 03:08:10.579
DATABASE AND THEN GOING AFTER

03:08:10.646 --> 03:08:12.748
THEM OR THEIR FAMILY, WHO MAY BE

03:08:12.814 --> 03:08:15.450
UNDOCUMENTED. AND IF AN

03:08:15.517 --> 03:08:17.019
INDIVIDUAL DIS ENROLLS, THAT

03:08:17.085 --> 03:08:18.587
WILL NOT NECESSARILY PROTECT

03:08:18.654 --> 03:08:20.389
THEIR DATA, SINCE WE DON'T KNOW

03:08:20.455 --> 03:08:22.190
THE EXTENT TO WHICH HOW MUCH

03:08:22.257 --> 03:08:24.026
INFORMATION HHS HAS ALREADY

03:08:24.092 --> 03:08:27.262
SHARED WITH ICE BECAUSE OF THE

03:08:27.329 --> 03:08:28.363
ATTACKS ON OUR IMMIGRANT

03:08:28.430 --> 03:08:30.065
COMMUNITIES, ACCESS TO MEDI-CAL

03:08:30.132 --> 03:08:31.667
IN BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE

03:08:31.733 --> 03:08:34.102
BUDGETS, OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS

03:08:34.169 --> 03:08:35.037
ARE HAVING A HARD TIME KEEPING

03:08:35.103 --> 03:08:37.539
TRACK OF IT ALL, AND THEY ARE

03:08:37.606 --> 03:08:39.141
HAVING AN EVEN HARDER TIME

03:08:39.207 --> 03:08:40.842
DECIDING WHAT THE PROPER

03:08:40.909 --> 03:08:42.444
DECISION FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE

03:08:42.511 --> 03:08:45.614
SITUATION IS. LAST MONTH, I WAS

03:08:45.681 --> 03:08:46.948
CONTACTED BY A COMMUNITY MEMBER

03:08:47.015 --> 03:08:49.217
WHO NEEDED A SURGERY. THEY

03:08:49.284 --> 03:08:50.385
WANTED TO ENROLL IN MEDI-CAL,

03:08:50.452 --> 03:08:51.353
BUT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

03:08:51.420 --> 03:08:54.489
THE DATA SHARING. RIGHTFULLY SO.

03:08:54.556 --> 03:08:55.891
THEY HE DIDN'T WANT HIS

03:08:55.957 --> 03:08:58.427
INFORMATION SHARED WITH ICE. HE

03:08:58.493 --> 03:09:00.395
WANTED TO WAIT TO SEE HOW THIS

03:09:00.462 --> 03:09:03.298
PLAYED OUT IN THE COURTS. BUT

03:09:03.365 --> 03:09:04.666
BECAUSE OF OUR STATE BUDGET

03:09:04.733 --> 03:09:05.801
DECISIONS, THIS INDIVIDUAL IS

03:09:05.867 --> 03:09:07.903
NOW FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:10.572
THEIR HEALTH OR THEIR SAFETY

03:09:10.639 --> 03:09:12.641
BECAUSE THE MEDI-CAL ENROLLMENT

03:09:12.708 --> 03:09:16.144
FREEZE IS LOOMING AHEAD. LOOK,

03:09:16.211 --> 03:09:17.245
NOW MORE THAN EVER, OUR

03:09:17.312 --> 03:09:19.748
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY'S HEALTH AND

03:09:19.815 --> 03:09:21.216
SAFETY IS UNDER THREAT. WHETHER

03:09:21.283 --> 03:09:24.553
IT BE FROM OUR ACCESS TO HEALTH

03:09:24.619 --> 03:09:26.288
COVERAGE BEING STRIPPED AWAY, OR

03:09:26.354 --> 03:09:27.389
BECAUSE WE'RE SCARED TO STEP OUT

03:09:27.456 --> 03:09:30.258
OF OUR DOOR DUE TO THE VIOLENT

03:09:30.325 --> 03:09:32.360
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

03:09:32.427 --> 03:09:34.229
CALIFORNIA MUST ONCE AGAIN

03:09:34.296 --> 03:09:35.731
CHAMPION POLICIES THAT CATALYZED

03:09:35.797 --> 03:09:37.132
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM

03:09:37.199 --> 03:09:40.102
FORWARD, RATHER THAN FREEZING

03:09:40.168 --> 03:09:41.436
OUR COMMUNITIES OUT OF IT. THANK

03:09:41.503 --> 03:09:45.574
YOU SO MUCH. YOU TWO ARE

03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:47.375
PHENOMENAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH

03:09:47.442 --> 03:09:50.846
FOR JUST. HOW CANDID. AND YOU

03:09:50.912 --> 03:09:52.547
KNOW, YOU DIDN'T SUGARCOAT

03:09:52.614 --> 03:09:54.015
ANYTHING, WHICH IS THAT IT'S THE

03:09:54.082 --> 03:09:56.017
REALITY FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS

03:09:56.084 --> 03:09:57.586
RIGHT NOW. SO I DO APPRECIATE

03:09:57.652 --> 03:09:59.054
YOU COMING AND BRINGING THOSE

03:09:59.121 --> 03:10:01.890
ELEVATING THOSE STORIES.

03:10:01.957 --> 03:10:04.760
SENATOR. THANK YOU. CHAIR, I

03:10:04.826 --> 03:10:06.962
WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR

03:10:07.028 --> 03:10:09.030
COMING TO PRESENT BEFORE US

03:10:09.097 --> 03:10:12.033
TODAY. WE ARE DEFINITELY IN

03:10:12.100 --> 03:10:13.368
DIFFICULT TIMES. IT WAS NOT, YOU

03:10:13.435 --> 03:10:15.537
KNOW, EASY STATE BUDGETARY

03:10:15.604 --> 03:10:17.472
ISSUES AND WE DON'T KNOW THE

03:10:17.539 --> 03:10:19.441
FULL IMPACT BECAUSE WE WILL BE

03:10:19.508 --> 03:10:21.643
HAVING SOME SIGNIFICANT CUTS. AS

03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:24.112
THE FIRST PANEL HIGHLIGHTED FROM

03:10:24.179 --> 03:10:25.647
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO

03:10:25.714 --> 03:10:27.783
WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO IS

03:10:27.849 --> 03:10:29.651
EXTREMELY LIMITED AT THIS POINT.

03:10:29.718 --> 03:10:32.721
BUT YOUR PROGRAM, HEALTHCARE

03:10:32.788 --> 03:10:43.598
WITHOUT FEAR. INTRIGUING. SO,

03:10:43.665 --> 03:10:44.699
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

03:10:44.766 --> 03:10:47.936
HEARING A LOT THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:10:48.003 --> 03:10:50.405
AFRAID TO EVEN OPEN THEIR DOORS

03:10:50.472 --> 03:10:54.109
TO PEOPLE WHO COME. SO I WAS

03:10:54.176 --> 03:10:57.779
WONDERING HOW HOW ARE YOU ABLE

03:10:57.846 --> 03:11:00.248
TO GET THOSE PATIENTS TO OPEN

03:11:00.315 --> 03:11:02.384
THE DOORS AND ALLOW THE

03:11:02.450 --> 03:11:04.219
PROVIDERS TO COME IN TO THEIR

03:11:04.286 --> 03:11:06.655
HOME TO PROVIDE THE CARE THAT

03:11:06.721 --> 03:11:07.389
THEY NEED? ARE THESE THEIR THEIR

03:11:07.455 --> 03:11:08.623
DOCTORS THAT THEY'VE BEEN SEEING

03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:10.325
SO THEY KNOW THEM? IS IT

03:11:10.392 --> 03:11:11.226
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE THAT

03:11:11.293 --> 03:11:13.161
YOU'RE SENDING OUT OR CALLING TO

03:11:13.228 --> 03:11:14.262
THE PATIENTS IN ADVANCE? I'M

03:11:14.329 --> 03:11:16.031
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

03:11:16.097 --> 03:11:17.933
HOW YOU ALL ARE ABLE TO MAKE IT

03:11:17.999 --> 03:11:20.001
WORK, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

03:11:20.068 --> 03:11:21.336
EXCELLENT THAT THAT YOU'VE DONE

03:11:21.403 --> 03:11:23.705
THIS. BUT HOW ARE YOU HOW DO YOU

03:11:23.772 --> 03:11:25.674
HAVE THAT TRUST FOR THAT

03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:27.175
PARTICULAR PATIENT TO LET YOU

03:11:27.242 --> 03:11:29.611
IN? THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION. I

03:11:29.678 --> 03:11:31.847
THINK THAT AS FEDERALLY

03:11:31.913 --> 03:11:33.281
QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS,

03:11:33.348 --> 03:11:34.616
OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE VERY INGRAINED

03:11:34.683 --> 03:11:36.218
IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE

03:11:36.284 --> 03:11:40.822
SERVE. WE MADE WE DECIDED WHEN

03:11:40.889 --> 03:11:42.724
THE WHEN THE TRUMP

03:11:42.791 --> 03:11:44.559
ADMINISTRATION FIRST TOOK OFFICE

03:11:44.626 --> 03:11:46.661
THAT WE WERE GOING TO CALL. WE

03:11:46.728 --> 03:11:47.262
KNEW SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS

03:11:47.329 --> 03:11:49.865
COMING DOWN. SOME OF THESE THESE

03:11:49.931 --> 03:11:52.033
ICE RAIDS OR ATTACKS ON

03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:53.501
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES OR ON THEIR

03:11:53.568 --> 03:11:55.670
HEALTH CARE. SO WE STARTED

03:11:55.737 --> 03:11:58.240
CALLING ALL OF OUR 25,000 PLUS

03:11:58.306 --> 03:11:59.941
PATIENTS WHO WE KNOW ARE

03:12:00.008 --> 03:12:02.444
UNDOCUMENTED. AND WE ASKED THEM,

03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:04.079
YOU KNOW, WHAT THEIR GREATEST

03:12:04.145 --> 03:12:07.482
FEARS WERE AND WHAT KIND OF

03:12:07.549 --> 03:12:09.684
SERVICES THEY WOULD BE WILLING

03:12:09.751 --> 03:12:12.187
TO ACCESS. AND SO WE HAD A SENSE

03:12:12.254 --> 03:12:14.322
GOING IN BEFORE THE RAIDS REALLY

03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:15.924
STARTED. WE HAD A SENSE OF WHAT

03:12:15.991 --> 03:12:18.727
WAS WHAT WAS ON THE MINDS OF OUR

03:12:18.793 --> 03:12:19.861
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. SO WHEN THE

03:12:19.928 --> 03:12:22.998
RAIDS HIT, WE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN

03:12:23.064 --> 03:12:25.033
CALLING THOSE PATIENTS BACK,

03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:26.268
PARTICULARLY THE PATIENTS WHO

03:12:26.334 --> 03:12:28.470
DIDN'T SHOW OR CANCELED THEIR

03:12:28.536 --> 03:12:29.471
APPOINTMENTS AND ASKED THEM IF

03:12:29.537 --> 03:12:30.972
THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO HAVE A

03:12:31.039 --> 03:12:34.342
DOCTOR VISIT THEIR HOME. AND

03:12:34.409 --> 03:12:36.077
AGAIN, WE CALLED THOUSANDS OF

03:12:36.144 --> 03:12:37.479
PATIENTS, AND WE CALLED HUNDREDS

03:12:37.545 --> 03:12:39.247
EVERY DAY WHO HAD MISSED THEIR

03:12:39.314 --> 03:12:41.349
APPOINTMENTS. AND MANY OF THE

03:12:41.416 --> 03:12:42.817
PATIENTS, PROBABLY HALF OF THE

03:12:42.884 --> 03:12:45.153
PATIENTS, SAID NO AND REQUESTED

03:12:45.220 --> 03:12:47.622
A TELEHEALTH VISIT. BUT ABOUT

03:12:47.689 --> 03:12:49.557
HALF OF THE PATIENTS SAID YES.

03:12:49.624 --> 03:12:52.460
AND SO THOSE ARE THE PATIENTS

03:12:52.527 --> 03:12:55.964
THAT WE VISITED. THANK YOU FOR

03:12:56.031 --> 03:12:58.767
THAT. AND THANK YOU FOR BEING SO

03:12:58.833 --> 03:13:02.737
PROACTIVE IN. ONE REALIZING THAT

03:13:02.804 --> 03:13:05.140
THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL ISSUE,

03:13:05.206 --> 03:13:06.942
BUT TO ALSO COMING UP WITH A

03:13:07.008 --> 03:13:08.743
VERY QUICK SOLUTION SO THAT YOUR

03:13:08.810 --> 03:13:12.380
PATIENTS AREN'T. MISSING OUT ON

03:13:12.447 --> 03:13:14.616
THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED,

03:13:14.683 --> 03:13:17.018
WHETHER VIA TELEHEALTH OR

03:13:17.085 --> 03:13:19.921
ACTUALLY IN PERSON. DO YOU SEE A

03:13:19.988 --> 03:13:27.829
ROLE FOR NOT ONLY. WITH YOUR.

03:13:27.896 --> 03:13:31.499
HOSPITAL, BUT OR YOUR CLINIC,

03:13:31.566 --> 03:13:34.002
BUT JUST IN GENERAL WITHIN THE

03:13:34.069 --> 03:13:35.670
HEALTH CARE SPACE OF STARTING TO

03:13:35.737 --> 03:13:37.472
HAVE MORE COLLABORATION WITH

03:13:37.539 --> 03:13:40.575
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS?

03:13:40.642 --> 03:13:41.843
BECAUSE THAT TRUST IS EXTREMELY

03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:43.044
IMPORTANT. AND LIKE YOU SAID,

03:13:43.111 --> 03:13:44.179
IT'S A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED

03:13:44.245 --> 03:13:45.080
HEALTH CENTER. YOU'RE THERE IN

03:13:45.146 --> 03:13:46.881
THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S NOT

03:13:46.948 --> 03:13:48.016
NECESSARILY THE CASE FOR EVERY

03:13:48.083 --> 03:13:49.818
CLINIC OR EVERY HOSPITAL. SO DO

03:13:49.884 --> 03:13:52.354
YOU SEE A ROLE IN THE FUTURE IN

03:13:52.420 --> 03:13:54.789
NEEDING TO STRENGTHEN THOSE

03:13:54.856 --> 03:13:56.958
RELATIONSHIPS? IN CASE WE NEED

03:13:57.025 --> 03:13:59.461
TO DO MORE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

03:13:59.527 --> 03:14:01.262
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S A VERY,

03:14:01.329 --> 03:14:03.298
VERY IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE

03:14:03.365 --> 03:14:04.899
SAINT JOHN'S HAS BEEN THERE A

03:14:04.966 --> 03:14:07.736
LONG TIME, AND WE HAVE VERY DEEP

03:14:07.802 --> 03:14:09.304
RELATIONSHIPS IN SOUTH LA AND

03:14:09.371 --> 03:14:12.073
EAST LOS ANGELES. AND, YOU KNOW,

03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:13.842
WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

03:14:13.908 --> 03:14:14.976
CHIRLA. WE WORK VERY CLOSELY

03:14:15.043 --> 03:14:17.512
WITH CPIC AND MANY OTHER

03:14:17.579 --> 03:14:19.381
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS,

03:14:19.447 --> 03:14:20.782
PARTICULARLY COMMUNITY BASED

03:14:20.849 --> 03:14:22.250
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE LA AREA AND

03:14:22.317 --> 03:14:24.352
THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND SO THAT

03:14:24.419 --> 03:14:26.421
HAS HELPED A LOT, BECAUSE A LOT

03:14:26.488 --> 03:14:27.088
OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

03:14:27.155 --> 03:14:31.092
REACHED OUT TO THEIR CLIENTS,

03:14:31.159 --> 03:14:32.093
MANY OF WHOM ARE PATIENTS OF

03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:34.095
SAINT JOHN'S. SO IT WAS KIND OF

03:14:34.162 --> 03:14:36.097
A JOINT EFFORT THAT ALLOWED US

03:14:36.164 --> 03:14:38.266
TO REACH THOSE PATIENTS. ONE

03:14:38.333 --> 03:14:40.268
THING I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IS

03:14:40.335 --> 03:14:42.003
THAT WE DID CALL THE DEPARTMENT

03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:43.104
OF HEALTH SERVICES TO SEE IF WE

03:14:43.171 --> 03:14:44.773
COULD GET REIMBURSED FOR THOSE

03:14:44.839 --> 03:14:46.608
HOME VISITS, AND THEY SAID NO.

03:14:46.674 --> 03:14:49.110
SO WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING THAT

03:14:49.177 --> 03:14:50.912
WITHOUT ANY REIMBURSEMENT

03:14:50.979 --> 03:14:52.280
WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING THE

03:14:52.347 --> 03:14:57.652
DELIVERY OF MEDICINE. THANK YOU

03:14:57.719 --> 03:15:03.858
FOR THAT. JIM. YOU MENTIONED YOU

03:15:03.925 --> 03:15:04.893
STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE

03:15:04.959 --> 03:15:06.394
INCIDENT AT MACARTHUR PARK IN

03:15:06.461 --> 03:15:08.263
THE PREVIOUS PANEL. WE TALKED

03:15:08.329 --> 03:15:10.398
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF

03:15:10.465 --> 03:15:11.332
REPLICATING STREET MEDICINE LIKE

03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:12.967
WE DO WITH THE UNHOUSED

03:15:13.034 --> 03:15:16.504
POPULATION TO THIS POPULATION,

03:15:16.571 --> 03:15:19.107
BUT WE COULD ENCOUNTER

03:15:19.174 --> 03:15:20.542
ADDITIONAL INCIDENTS LIKE YOU

03:15:20.608 --> 03:15:22.043
DID. SO WOULD YOU SAY, IS THIS

03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:24.112
NOT THE SOLUTION TO GET CARE TO

03:15:24.179 --> 03:15:25.513
THIS POPULATION? DURING THESE

03:15:25.580 --> 03:15:27.348
TIMES? I THINK WE HAVE TO TRY

03:15:27.415 --> 03:15:29.417
MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS. WE DO HAVE

03:15:29.484 --> 03:15:30.952
MOBILES THAT ARE GOING OUT ON,

03:15:31.019 --> 03:15:34.089
YOU KNOW, AND WE'RE CONTACTING

03:15:34.155 --> 03:15:35.623
NEIGHBORS IN THE IMMEDIATE

03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:37.859
SURROUNDING BLOCKS AND THEY FEEL

03:15:37.926 --> 03:15:39.561
A LITTLE MORE SECURE IN THE

03:15:39.627 --> 03:15:41.329
RESIDENTIAL AREA TO COME OUT AND

03:15:41.396 --> 03:15:44.632
ACCESS THE MOBILE. BUT WE'VE HAD

03:15:44.699 --> 03:15:47.068
OUR MOBILE HIT BY ICE IN

03:15:47.135 --> 03:15:48.937
ADDITION TO MACARTHUR PARK,

03:15:49.003 --> 03:15:51.840
ANOTHER TIME WHERE WE LITERALLY

03:15:51.906 --> 03:15:53.308
ARE SECURITY. WE'VE DONE A LOT

03:15:53.374 --> 03:15:55.410
OF TRAININGS WITH OUR STAFF, OF

03:15:55.477 --> 03:15:57.679
COURSE, AND OUR SECURITY GUARDS

03:15:57.745 --> 03:16:00.181
QUICKLY. WE WERE AT A ALCOHOL

03:16:00.248 --> 03:16:01.483
AND DRUG RECOVERY CENTER IN

03:16:01.549 --> 03:16:05.086
DOWNEY, AND ICE PULLED UP, AND

03:16:05.153 --> 03:16:06.888
WE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE GATES

03:16:06.955 --> 03:16:08.656
AND MOVED THE PATIENTS INTO THE

03:16:08.723 --> 03:16:11.893
MOBILE. BUT THE MOBILE HAS BEEN

03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:14.462
WE HAVEN'T HAD OUR CLINICS HIT,

03:16:14.529 --> 03:16:16.331
BUT WE'VE HAD ICE APPROACHED

03:16:16.397 --> 03:16:17.432
SEVERAL OF OUR MOBILES ON

03:16:17.499 --> 03:16:20.301
SEVERAL OCCASIONS, SO THE MOBILE

03:16:20.368 --> 03:16:22.003
SEEMED TO US TO BE A LITTLE MORE

03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:24.873
VULNERABLE. BUT WE HAVE TAKEN

03:16:24.939 --> 03:16:26.741
THEM INTO LIKE A RESIDENTIAL

03:16:26.808 --> 03:16:28.643
BLOCK AND THEN CONTACTED ALL OF

03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:31.079
OUR PATIENTS ON THAT BLOCK AND

03:16:31.146 --> 03:16:33.181
HAD THEM COME OUT, AND THAT THAT

03:16:33.248 --> 03:16:35.016
HAS WORKED. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE

03:16:35.083 --> 03:16:37.986
HAD TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A LOT OF

03:16:38.052 --> 03:16:38.753
SECURITY BECAUSE PATIENTS WANTED

03:16:38.820 --> 03:16:40.722
TO KNOW THAT THEY HAD A BUFFER

03:16:40.788 --> 03:16:43.291
BETWEEN A POTENTIAL ICE

03:16:43.358 --> 03:16:44.726
INTERVENTION AND THE CLINIC

03:16:44.792 --> 03:16:46.895
SPACE. OKAY. AND THEN YOU SPOKE

03:16:46.961 --> 03:16:48.329
ABOUT YOU WERE ABLE TO CALL

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:52.267
THOSE 2500 OR 25,000, 25,000

03:16:52.333 --> 03:16:53.735
INDIVIDUALS. DO YOU KNEW THEY

03:16:53.801 --> 03:16:55.203
WERE UNDOCUMENTED? BUT I'VE

03:16:55.270 --> 03:16:56.404
HEARD FROM OTHER ENTITIES THAT

03:16:56.471 --> 03:16:58.239
THEY DON'T KNOW WHO IS

03:16:58.306 --> 03:16:58.907
UNDOCUMENTED, THAT THEY SERVE IN

03:16:58.973 --> 03:17:00.842
THEIR CLINICS. HOW WERE YOU ABLE

03:17:00.909 --> 03:17:02.277
TO GET THAT DATA? AND CAN YOU

03:17:02.343 --> 03:17:04.312
STILL DO YOU STILL KNOW WHICH OF

03:17:04.379 --> 03:17:05.914
YOUR CLIENTS OR PATIENTS ARE

03:17:05.980 --> 03:17:07.081
UNDOCUMENTED? WELL, THE BENEFIT

03:17:07.148 --> 03:17:09.184
OF BEING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

03:17:09.250 --> 03:17:11.119
IS THAT PRIOR TO THE EXPANSION

03:17:11.186 --> 03:17:14.322
OF MEDI-CAL TO THE UNDOCUMENTED

03:17:14.389 --> 03:17:15.190
POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA, THERE

03:17:15.256 --> 03:17:17.759
WAS A PROGRAM CALLED MY HEALTH

03:17:17.825 --> 03:17:19.661
LA. AND THAT PROGRAM WAS

03:17:19.727 --> 03:17:20.828
SPECIFICALLY FOR UNDOCUMENTED

03:17:20.895 --> 03:17:22.864
IMMIGRANTS WHO WERE NOT ELIGIBLE

03:17:22.931 --> 03:17:26.501
FOR MEDI-CAL. AND SO THAT LIST

03:17:26.568 --> 03:17:29.370
IS WHAT WE USE AS A BASIS. AND

03:17:29.437 --> 03:17:30.638
I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE THERE

03:17:30.705 --> 03:17:31.839
WERE PATIENTS THAT WERE MISSED

03:17:31.906 --> 03:17:33.374
THAT SOME OF THOSE PATIENTS

03:17:33.441 --> 03:17:35.143
OBVIOUSLY DROPPED OFF IN THE

03:17:35.210 --> 03:17:36.878
MEDI-CAL TRANSITION, AND THERE

03:17:36.945 --> 03:17:38.813
WERE NEW ONES THAT JOINED, BUT

03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:44.319
WE HAD A CORE LIST OF PATIENTS

03:17:44.385 --> 03:17:45.987
WHO WE KNEW WERE UNDOCUMENTED

03:17:46.054 --> 03:17:47.055
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO REACH OUT

03:17:47.121 --> 03:17:49.290
TO. I REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM,

03:17:49.357 --> 03:17:51.759
ACTUALLY. YEAH. CARLOS, YOU GAVE

03:17:51.826 --> 03:17:53.661
A STORY REGARDING ONE OF THE

03:17:53.728 --> 03:17:55.029
INDIVIDUALS MAKING THAT

03:17:55.096 --> 03:17:57.398
DECISION. ANECDOTALLY, AS YOU'RE

03:17:57.465 --> 03:17:58.866
HEARING, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

03:17:58.933 --> 03:18:00.702
HEARING MORE OF THOSE SCENARIOS

03:18:00.768 --> 03:18:04.339
OR INDIVIDUALS OPTING TO SIGN ON

03:18:04.405 --> 03:18:06.908
GIVEN THAT RESTRICTION COMING

03:18:06.975 --> 03:18:08.776
UP, OR ARE THEY OPTING TO NOT

03:18:08.843 --> 03:18:12.480
SIGN ON? SOMETIMES IT'S 5050

03:18:12.547 --> 03:18:15.283
REALLY. LIKE THEY COME TO US

03:18:15.350 --> 03:18:17.986
ASKING FOR INFORMATION. AND AS

03:18:18.052 --> 03:18:19.020
AN ORGANIZATION, THE BEST WE

03:18:19.087 --> 03:18:22.090
COULD DO IS GIVE THEM THE FACTS.

03:18:22.156 --> 03:18:24.092
RIGHT GIVEN GIVING THEM THE

03:18:24.158 --> 03:18:27.028
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS HAPPENED. AND

03:18:27.095 --> 03:18:28.863
BY THIS I MEAN CMS SHARING THE

03:18:28.930 --> 03:18:30.698
DATA WITH DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

03:18:30.765 --> 03:18:32.166
SECURITY AND ALSO LETTING THEM

03:18:32.233 --> 03:18:33.568
KNOW WHAT OPTIONS THEY HAVE TO

03:18:33.635 --> 03:18:36.404
ENROLL IN MEDI-CAL AND LETTING

03:18:36.471 --> 03:18:39.641
THEM DECIDE, REALLY. AND I'VE

03:18:39.707 --> 03:18:41.709
SEEN IT GO EITHER WAY. SO ARE

03:18:41.776 --> 03:18:43.011
YOU. I MEAN, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

03:18:43.077 --> 03:18:44.245
STRUGGLING WITH THAT TALKING

03:18:44.312 --> 03:18:46.681
POINT, THAT MESSAGING AS WELL IS

03:18:46.748 --> 03:18:48.983
I WANT MY COMMUNITY TO HAVE

03:18:49.050 --> 03:18:51.119
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, BUT THEY

03:18:51.185 --> 03:18:52.987
NEED TO KNOW ALSO IF THEY SIGN

03:18:53.054 --> 03:18:55.256
UP, RIGHT, THEY COULD BE ON THE

03:18:55.323 --> 03:18:56.758
LIST. SO IN YOUR IN YOUR

03:18:56.824 --> 03:18:59.427
OPINION, THE MESSAGING TO THE

03:18:59.494 --> 03:19:01.129
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW IS

03:19:01.195 --> 03:19:03.264
GIVEN THE FACTS AND HAVE THEM

03:19:03.331 --> 03:19:05.233
DECIDE. YEAH, LETTING THEM MAKE

03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:07.635
THE BEST DECISION FOR THEIR OWN

03:19:07.702 --> 03:19:09.404
HEALTH CARE SITUATION WITHOUT

03:19:09.470 --> 03:19:12.340
LEANING TO THIS TO THAT. I, I

03:19:12.407 --> 03:19:14.509
TRY NOT TO. RIGHT. BUT LIKE IF

03:19:14.575 --> 03:19:16.878
AN INDIVIDUAL TELLS ME LIKE HOW

03:19:16.944 --> 03:19:18.713
SEVERE THEIR CONDITION MAY BE, I

03:19:18.780 --> 03:19:21.316
MIGHT LIKE, HEY, GIVEN THE

03:19:21.382 --> 03:19:22.784
SITUATION, MAYBE ENROLLING IN

03:19:22.850 --> 03:19:23.351
MEDI-CAL MIGHT BE THE BEST

03:19:23.418 --> 03:19:25.253
DECISION, RIGHT? BUT AGAIN, I

03:19:25.320 --> 03:19:28.589
TRY TO LIKE NOT LEAN THEM ONE

03:19:28.656 --> 03:19:30.958
WAY OR ANOTHER. AND AGAIN, IT'S

03:19:31.025 --> 03:19:32.393
5050. PEOPLE ARE LIKE, I'LL JUST

03:19:37.098 --> 03:19:40.368
JUST KNOW COME JAN 2026 AND

03:19:40.435 --> 03:19:41.936
ENROLLMENT FREEZE IS COMING,

RIGHT? YEAH, THANKS. YEAH I

03:19:45.773 --> 03:19:47.575
THINK THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT

03:19:47.642 --> 03:19:48.943
PARTICULAR EXAMPLE AND SOME OF

03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:50.411
THE IMPACTS THAT YOU'RE SEEING.

03:19:50.478 --> 03:19:52.080
AND MY QUESTION TO ONE OF MY

03:19:52.146 --> 03:19:54.315
QUESTIONS TO THE FIRST PANEL WAS

03:19:54.382 --> 03:19:57.585
AROUND PERHAPS A LITTLE MUDDLED

03:19:57.652 --> 03:20:01.489
IN MY QUESTIONING WHAT THE

03:20:01.556 --> 03:20:02.957
INTERACTION OR THE INTERPLAY

03:20:03.024 --> 03:20:05.460
BETWEEN THE RECENT CHANGES OR

03:20:05.526 --> 03:20:07.862
BUDGET DECISIONS THAT CALIFORNIA

03:20:07.929 --> 03:20:12.266
MADE IN ADVANCE OF H.R. ONE, AND

03:20:12.333 --> 03:20:15.503
WHETHER THERE ARE ASPECTS OF

03:20:15.570 --> 03:20:17.171
WHAT WE'VE ALREADY MOVED FORWARD

03:20:17.238 --> 03:20:19.807
WITH OUR PROPOSAL THAT NEED TO

03:20:19.874 --> 03:20:22.410
BE REEXAMINED, GIVEN THE

03:20:22.477 --> 03:20:23.945
EXISTENCE OF H.R. ONE, I THINK

03:20:24.011 --> 03:20:26.347
THAT YOU'RE HITTING ON ONE OF

03:20:26.414 --> 03:20:27.849
THE AREAS WHERE THERE IS JUST A

03:20:27.915 --> 03:20:30.985
NATURAL TENSION, RIGHT? IF WE

03:20:31.052 --> 03:20:32.820
AND CHIRLA MENTIONED THIS AS

03:20:32.887 --> 03:20:34.756
WELL, WHERE WE WANT TO BE ABLE

03:20:34.822 --> 03:20:36.124
TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:20:36.190 --> 03:20:38.993
ENROLLING PRIOR TO THE MEDI-CAL

03:20:39.060 --> 03:20:41.095
ENROLLMENT FREEZE THAT WE NEEDED

03:20:41.162 --> 03:20:43.131
TO IMPLEMENT TO, WELL, THAT THAT

03:20:43.197 --> 03:20:46.768
WE ADOPTED. BUT THEN THAT ALSO

03:20:46.834 --> 03:20:48.269
KIND OF PUTS US IN TENSION WITH

03:20:48.336 --> 03:20:50.538
THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE WANT SOME

03:20:50.605 --> 03:20:53.007
CERTAINTY AROUND THE PROTECTION

03:20:53.074 --> 03:20:56.210
OF THEIR OF THEIR DATA AND THEIR

03:20:56.277 --> 03:20:59.814
PRIVACY SO THAT THEY WILL NOT BE

03:20:59.881 --> 03:21:03.451
MORE VULNERABLE TO BEING EXPOSED

03:21:03.518 --> 03:21:06.921
TO THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL

03:21:06.988 --> 03:21:08.423
GOVERNMENT, WHICH, BY THE WAY,

03:21:08.489 --> 03:21:12.093
ARE SWEEPING UP PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:15.296
DOCUMENTED UNDOCUMENTED, OF

03:21:15.363 --> 03:21:18.399
LEGAL STATUS, OF, YOU KNOW,

03:21:18.466 --> 03:21:20.067
THEY'RE SWEEPING UP PEOPLE WHO

03:21:20.134 --> 03:21:22.870
ARE BLACK AND BROWN. AND OUR

03:21:22.937 --> 03:21:25.673
AAPI COMMUNITIES IN IN RECORD

03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:28.276
NUMBERS, IN MANY INSTANCES,

03:21:28.342 --> 03:21:30.111
NONDISCRIMINATORY. SO IT IS VERY

03:21:30.178 --> 03:21:31.045
IMPORTANT FOR US TO KIND OF LOOK

03:21:31.112 --> 03:21:33.147
AT THOSE AREAS WHERE THERE IS

03:21:33.214 --> 03:21:35.149
NATURAL TENSION KIND OF BUILT IN

03:21:35.216 --> 03:21:36.083
SEEING WHAT THE FEDERAL

03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:37.151
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE AROUND

03:21:37.218 --> 03:21:39.754
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, AROUND

03:21:39.821 --> 03:21:41.989
THE ASPECTS OF H.R. ONE, SO THAT

03:21:42.056 --> 03:21:44.525
WE CAN GO BACK AND SEE WHETHER

03:21:44.592 --> 03:21:45.560
OR NOT THERE IS SOME HARM

03:21:45.626 --> 03:21:46.594
MITIGATION THAT WE SHOULD ENGAGE

03:21:46.661 --> 03:21:48.396
IN AS THE LEGISLATURE. SO I

03:21:48.463 --> 03:21:49.130
REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING

03:21:49.197 --> 03:21:51.732
UP THAT VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLE TO

03:21:51.799 --> 03:21:54.869
BE ABLE TO HAVE US PERHAPS LOOK

03:21:54.936 --> 03:21:57.438
AT, LOOK AT OUR EFFORTS THERE TO

03:21:57.505 --> 03:21:59.173
SEE WHAT KIND OF TENSIONS THERE

03:21:59.240 --> 03:22:00.074
ARE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER AREAS

03:22:00.141 --> 03:22:02.477
WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE THERE IS A

03:22:02.543 --> 03:22:03.144
NATURAL TENSION BETWEEN WHAT YOU

03:22:03.211 --> 03:22:06.314
ARE SAYING FROM HEALTH PROVIDER

03:22:06.380 --> 03:22:10.618
PERSPECTIVE AROUND H.R. ONE, AND

03:22:10.685 --> 03:22:15.590
WHERE CALIFORNIA IS? HAS ALREADY

03:22:15.656 --> 03:22:16.791
MADE SOME DECISIONS TO TAKE,

03:22:16.858 --> 03:22:19.794
SOME ACTIONS TO BE ABLE TO DEAL

03:22:19.861 --> 03:22:22.563
WITH THE OVERALL COST OF HEALTH

03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:27.335
CARE. WELL, I THINK THAT THAT'S

03:22:27.401 --> 03:22:32.673
A HARD QUESTION. VERY THOUGHTFUL

03:22:32.740 --> 03:22:33.774
QUESTION, BUT A VERY HARD

03:22:33.841 --> 03:22:39.680
QUESTION, I THINK THAT. I THINK

03:22:39.747 --> 03:22:43.417
THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS IN THE

03:22:43.484 --> 03:22:45.920
COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE THAT

03:22:45.987 --> 03:22:49.657
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

03:22:49.724 --> 03:22:51.425
GOING AFTER IMMIGRANT

03:22:51.492 --> 03:22:54.161
COMMUNITIES AND THAT THEY ARE

03:22:54.228 --> 03:22:55.830
COMING AT THEM IN MANY DIFFERENT

03:22:55.897 --> 03:22:57.698
WAYS. IN ADDITION TO THE RAIDS,

03:22:57.765 --> 03:23:00.868
THE DATA SHARING, THE

03:23:00.935 --> 03:23:04.071
ADMINISTRATIVE, THE, THE, THE

03:23:04.138 --> 03:23:05.406
CHANGING OF PUBLIC CHARGE,

03:23:05.473 --> 03:23:08.109
AGAIN. BUT I THINK WHAT PEOPLE

03:23:08.175 --> 03:23:11.879
ARE MOST SURPRISED BY IS THE

03:23:11.946 --> 03:23:15.883
STATE NOW INSTITUTING A FEE,

03:23:15.950 --> 03:23:19.820
FREEZING ENROLLMENT, AND CUTTING

03:23:19.887 --> 03:23:21.622
MEDI-CAL SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANT

03:23:21.689 --> 03:23:24.191
FAMILIES AS WELL. SO I THINK

03:23:24.258 --> 03:23:27.395
THAT IS I THINK A LOT OF

03:23:27.461 --> 03:23:28.796
FAMILIES AND CERTAINLY AS AN

03:23:28.863 --> 03:23:32.066
FQHC PROVIDER, WE THOUGHT THAT

03:23:32.133 --> 03:23:34.535
WE WOULD BE SAFE IN THE STATE OF

03:23:34.602 --> 03:23:36.137
CALIFORNIA. WE THOUGHT THAT THE

03:23:36.203 --> 03:23:37.071
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

03:23:37.138 --> 03:23:38.639
WOULD PROTECT THOSE GAINS THAT

03:23:38.706 --> 03:23:42.577
WE HAD MADE. AND SO, I MEAN,

03:23:42.643 --> 03:23:45.379
THERE ARE I MEAN, WE'RE WE'RE

03:23:45.446 --> 03:23:47.181
PART OF A FORMATION OF A

03:23:47.248 --> 03:23:50.618
COMMITTEE OF A COALITION TO PUT

03:23:50.685 --> 03:23:52.320
TO LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF

03:23:52.386 --> 03:23:53.955
PUTTING AN INITIATIVE ON THE

03:23:54.021 --> 03:23:57.825
BALLOT TO BRING IN REVENUE TO

03:23:57.892 --> 03:23:58.893
BACKFILL THE CUTS FROM THE FEDS,

03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:01.596
AND ALSO ALLOW THE STATE TO

03:24:01.662 --> 03:24:03.831
PREVENT MAKING THOSE CUTS

03:24:03.898 --> 03:24:06.467
THEMSELVES. AND IT WHAT WE'RE

03:24:06.534 --> 03:24:08.869
LOOKING AT IS THAT TAX ON THE

03:24:08.936 --> 03:24:12.373
RICH IN CALIFORNIA COMMENSURATE

03:24:12.440 --> 03:24:14.609
WITH THE AMOUNT THAT THAT THEY

03:24:14.675 --> 03:24:16.577
SAVED THROUGH THE FEDS COULD

03:24:16.644 --> 03:24:20.648
BRING IN ANYWHERE BETWEEN 80

03:24:20.715 --> 03:24:21.882
BILLION AND $150 BILLION, WHICH

03:24:21.949 --> 03:24:23.884
IS WAY MORE THAN THE $12 BILLION

03:24:23.951 --> 03:24:25.086
DEFICIT WE'RE LOOKING AND

03:24:25.152 --> 03:24:26.587
ESSENTIALLY WOULD END THE

03:24:26.654 --> 03:24:29.090
DEFICIT FOR THE FOR THE STATE OF

03:24:29.156 --> 03:24:32.393
CALIFORNIA FOREVER. SO, YOU

03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:34.028
KNOW, IF WE HAVE TO DO THAT

03:24:34.095 --> 03:24:35.529
OURSELVES, OBVIOUSLY, WITH

03:24:35.596 --> 03:24:37.898
PARTNERS IN LABOR AND OTHER THAN

03:24:37.965 --> 03:24:39.767
WE WILL, BUT OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD

03:24:39.834 --> 03:24:41.235
BE A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE AND A

03:24:41.302 --> 03:24:43.404
LOT EASIER IF THE LEGISLATURE

03:24:43.471 --> 03:24:45.139
WOULD EITHER DO THAT. AND IF THE

03:24:45.206 --> 03:24:46.574
GOVERNOR REFUSES TO SIGN IT,

03:24:46.641 --> 03:24:49.176
THEN TO PUT THAT ON THE BALLOT,

03:24:49.243 --> 03:24:51.012
I THINK WE COULD SAVE. AND I

03:24:51.078 --> 03:24:54.215
THINK IT WOULD BE A REAL

03:24:54.281 --> 03:24:56.384
STRATEGIC MOVE ON THE PART OF

03:24:56.450 --> 03:24:57.218
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO SAY

03:24:57.284 --> 03:24:59.086
TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, WE

03:24:59.153 --> 03:25:01.055
ARE NOT ACCEPTING THIS. WE ARE

03:25:01.122 --> 03:25:03.858
NOT GOING TO ALLOW DONALD TRUMP

03:25:03.924 --> 03:25:06.460
TO DICTATE HOW OUR FAMILIES IN

03:25:06.527 --> 03:25:07.128
CALIFORNIA ARE TREATED, AND

03:25:07.194 --> 03:25:08.996
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:25:09.063 --> 03:25:11.265
ALL OF THOSE CUTS THAT YOU'RE

03:25:11.332 --> 03:25:12.867
MAKING ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL ARE

03:25:12.933 --> 03:25:14.535
RESTORED. WE'RE GOING TO

03:25:14.602 --> 03:25:15.903
BACKFILL. I MEAN, IN LA COUNTY,

03:25:15.970 --> 03:25:17.171
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT

03:25:17.238 --> 03:25:18.973
OF PUBLIC HEALTH, DEPARTMENT OF

03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:20.775
HEALTH, SORRY, THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:25:20.841 --> 03:25:22.176
HEALTH SERVICES ALONE IS LOOKING

03:25:22.243 --> 03:25:24.612
AT CLOSING A PUBLIC HOSPITAL AND

03:25:24.679 --> 03:25:27.782
LAYING OFF 5000 WORKERS, UNION

03:25:27.848 --> 03:25:31.452
WORKERS. WE HAVE TO WE CAN'T

03:25:31.519 --> 03:25:32.386
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. I THINK IN

03:25:32.453 --> 03:25:34.822
THIS STATE AND WE HAVE THE

03:25:34.889 --> 03:25:36.557
RESOURCES. SO I DON'T THINK I

03:25:36.624 --> 03:25:39.226
REALLY ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION.

03:25:39.293 --> 03:25:42.129
ASSEMBLYWOMAN. I'M SORRY, I, I

03:25:42.196 --> 03:25:44.832
DON'T I CAN'T GRASP THE

03:25:44.899 --> 03:25:46.434
SPECIFICS OF THAT CORRELATION

03:25:46.500 --> 03:25:47.802
YET. I HAVE TO GIVE IT SOME

03:25:47.868 --> 03:25:50.738
THOUGHT. BUT I UNDERSTAND WHERE

03:25:50.805 --> 03:25:53.207
YOU'RE GOING, AND I IT'S KIND OF

03:25:53.274 --> 03:25:55.042
HERE, BUT I CAN'T I HAVE TO

03:25:55.109 --> 03:25:57.344
THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT. I'M

03:25:57.411 --> 03:25:59.113
SORRY. I DO APPRECIATE THE WHAT

03:25:59.180 --> 03:26:01.215
YOU DID OFFER, AND I THINK IT

03:26:01.282 --> 03:26:03.284
WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE FIRST

03:26:03.350 --> 03:26:06.954
PANEL AS WELL. WE ARE IN A

03:26:07.021 --> 03:26:09.223
MOMENT IN TIME WHERE CALIFORNIA

03:26:09.290 --> 03:26:10.591
ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE

03:26:10.658 --> 03:26:13.761
RESPONSIVE TO THE MOMENT WE ARE

03:26:13.828 --> 03:26:16.731
STEPPING UP IN THAT WAY AROUND

03:26:16.797 --> 03:26:20.735
ANOTHER AREA RELATED TO

03:26:20.801 --> 03:26:21.368
REDISTRICTING. WE KNOW THAT WE

03:26:21.435 --> 03:26:23.838
ARE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW, AND IT

03:26:23.904 --> 03:26:26.741
IS ENTIRELY BECAUSE OF JUST

03:26:26.807 --> 03:26:29.610
NEEDING TO BE INCREDIBLY

03:26:29.677 --> 03:26:33.247
RESPONSIVE TO THE POTENTIAL

03:26:33.314 --> 03:26:34.982
DESTRUCTION OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

03:26:35.049 --> 03:26:36.884
DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY. THAT'S

03:26:36.951 --> 03:26:38.586
WHY WE ARE DOING THAT. I DO

03:26:38.652 --> 03:26:40.688
THINK THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

03:26:40.755 --> 03:26:42.757
THE ENORMITY OF THE SITUATION

03:26:42.823 --> 03:26:44.391
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AS IT

03:26:44.458 --> 03:26:45.926
RELATES TO OUR HEALTH CARE

03:26:45.993 --> 03:26:50.197
SYSTEM, WITH AS MUCH INTENTION

03:26:50.264 --> 03:26:52.933
AND CREATIVITY TO ENSURE THAT WE

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.503
KEEP CALIFORNIANS AND THE

03:26:55.569 --> 03:26:56.370
PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AROUND

03:26:56.437 --> 03:26:58.572
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN PLACE.

03:26:58.639 --> 03:27:02.109
SO I APPRECIATE YOU OFFERING ONE

03:27:02.176 --> 03:27:04.545
POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE THAT WE

03:27:04.612 --> 03:27:06.380
THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN. AND

03:27:06.447 --> 03:27:07.782
THAT'S MORE ON THE REVENUE

03:27:07.848 --> 03:27:09.750
GENERATING SIDE, WHICH WE'VE

03:27:09.817 --> 03:27:11.719
SPENT A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING

03:27:11.786 --> 03:27:14.221
AS WELL. AND I'M SURE WE WILL

03:27:14.288 --> 03:27:15.623
COME UP WITH SOME OTHER

03:27:15.689 --> 03:27:17.925
SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH

03:27:17.992 --> 03:27:19.260
THE HEALTHCARE SAVINGS SIDE AS

03:27:19.326 --> 03:27:22.429
WELL. YEAH. AND I ALSO DID WANT

03:27:22.496 --> 03:27:23.664
TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR

03:27:23.731 --> 03:27:24.999
POSTPONING MANY OF THOSE CUTS,

03:27:25.065 --> 03:27:26.834
BECAUSE IT DOES GIVE US A

03:27:26.901 --> 03:27:28.669
WINDOW, AND IT DOES GIVE US THE

03:27:28.736 --> 03:27:29.870
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT SOME

03:27:29.937 --> 03:27:33.107
OTHER SOLUTIONS. SO, YOU KNOW, I

03:27:33.174 --> 03:27:35.543
THINK THAT WAS A VERY BOLD AND

03:27:35.609 --> 03:27:38.746
IMPORTANT MOVE THAT GIVES US THE

03:27:38.813 --> 03:27:40.514
TIME WE NEED IN ORDER TO FIGURE

03:27:40.581 --> 03:27:42.016
OUT A SOLUTION. I APPRECIATE

03:27:42.082 --> 03:27:44.518
THAT. THANK YOU. CHAIR.

03:27:44.585 --> 03:27:46.320
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

03:27:46.387 --> 03:27:47.922
THIS DIALOG, I APPRECIATE IT. I

03:27:47.988 --> 03:27:49.657
LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING

03:27:49.723 --> 03:27:50.791
CONVERSATIONS ON THIS. THANK YOU

03:27:50.858 --> 03:27:53.327
SO MUCH FOR INVITING US. WE'RE

03:27:53.394 --> 03:27:55.095
GOING TO NOW TURN TO PUBLIC

03:27:55.162 --> 03:28:10.845
COMMENT.

03:28:10.911 --> 03:28:12.112
WE COULD KEEP IT UNDER TWO

03:28:12.179 --> 03:28:13.414
MINUTES, PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY

03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:15.182
MUCH. VANESSA KAHINA WITH KP

03:28:15.249 --> 03:28:16.951
PUBLIC AFFAIRS. ON BEHALF OF A

03:28:17.017 --> 03:28:18.352
NUMBER OF CLIENTS, I DON'T KNOW

03:28:18.419 --> 03:28:21.488
WHERE TO START TODAY. THIS IS

03:28:21.555 --> 03:28:23.123
OVERWHELMING IN A WAY THAT I

03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:24.692
HAVEN'T SEEN IN MY ENTIRE

03:28:24.758 --> 03:28:27.828
CAREER. I CAN SAY THAT IN TERMS

03:28:27.895 --> 03:28:29.296
OF PROGRAMS OF ALL INCLUSIVE

03:28:29.363 --> 03:28:30.965
CARE FOR THE ELDERLY, THE THINGS

03:28:31.031 --> 03:28:32.366
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT, WHERE WE

03:28:32.433 --> 03:28:34.535
NEED TO BE PROACTIVE IS HOW WE

03:28:34.602 --> 03:28:35.970
GET NIMBLE AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

03:28:36.036 --> 03:28:37.371
ELIGIBILITY REDETERMINATIONS

03:28:37.438 --> 03:28:39.173
WHERE WE CAN BE LOOKING AT

03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:41.175
PLACES WHERE WE CAN SAVE MONEY

03:28:41.242 --> 03:28:42.042
ON THE FRONT END, ON PREVENTIVE

03:28:42.109 --> 03:28:43.477
CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH ESPECIALLY

03:28:43.544 --> 03:28:45.546
HIGH CHRONIC CONDITIONS, AND

03:28:45.613 --> 03:28:47.114
BETTER WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT

03:28:47.181 --> 03:28:48.482
CARE. SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS

03:28:48.549 --> 03:28:49.316
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE'VE

03:28:49.383 --> 03:28:51.185
BEEN TALKING ABOUT, I THINK THAT

03:28:51.252 --> 03:28:52.219
THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES

03:28:52.286 --> 03:28:55.022
THERE FOR US TO PARTNER. I CAN

03:28:55.089 --> 03:28:56.457
TELL YOU, WITH SOME ANECDOTAL

03:28:56.523 --> 03:28:57.157
EVIDENCE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

03:28:57.224 --> 03:28:59.660
ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS,

03:28:59.727 --> 03:29:01.228
ONE OF OUR MEMBER CLINICS IN THE

03:29:01.295 --> 03:29:03.364
CENTRAL VALLEY TOLD US THAT LAST

03:29:03.430 --> 03:29:06.533
WEEK THEY HAD A 40% DECLINE IN

03:29:06.600 --> 03:29:08.002
APPOINTMENTS. THOSE WERE

03:29:08.068 --> 03:29:09.570
CANCELLATIONS. THIS IS PRIMARY

03:29:09.637 --> 03:29:12.106
CARE. SO AS WE LOOK AND THINK

03:29:12.172 --> 03:29:14.108
ABOUT THE DATA SHARING AND THE

03:29:14.174 --> 03:29:14.942
DATA COLLECTION THAT WE CAN DO

03:29:15.009 --> 03:29:17.144
IN A SAFE WAY, WE'VE GOT TO BE

03:29:17.211 --> 03:29:18.746
LOOKING AT BOTH THE PRIMARY CARE

03:29:18.812 --> 03:29:19.914
FRONT END AND THEN ALSO THE

03:29:19.980 --> 03:29:21.916
EMERGENT CARE AND THE CONTINUITY

03:29:21.982 --> 03:29:24.218
OF CARE THAT NEEDS TO BE GOING

03:29:24.285 --> 03:29:25.719
ON WITH ALL OF THAT. AND FAMILY

03:29:25.786 --> 03:29:27.154
PHYSICIANS ARE CRITICALLY,

03:29:27.221 --> 03:29:28.656
CRITICALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ALL

03:29:28.722 --> 03:29:30.357
OF THESE CHANGES AND ARE THERE

03:29:30.424 --> 03:29:31.659
TO PARTNER WITH YOU AND REALLY

03:29:31.725 --> 03:29:32.393
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM

03:29:32.459 --> 03:29:34.028
SAINT JOHN'S. TODAY, I WILL

03:29:34.094 --> 03:29:36.196
LEAVE YOU WITH A GLIMMER OF HOPE

03:29:36.263 --> 03:29:38.766
THAT I HAD TODAY. IS THAT FOR VÆ

03:29:38.832 --> 03:29:40.000
COMPROMISO AND THE 4000

03:29:40.067 --> 03:29:42.269
PROMOTORAS DE SALUD AROUND

03:29:42.336 --> 03:29:44.071
CALIFORNIA, THEY CAN BE THOSE

03:29:44.138 --> 03:29:46.173
PUENTES DE SALUD, LOS PUNTOS DE

03:29:46.240 --> 03:29:47.241
COMUNIDAD, TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:29:47.308 --> 03:29:48.642
PEOPLE ARE GETTING WHAT THEY

03:29:48.709 --> 03:29:49.910
NEED. LET'S THINK ABOUT HOW TO

03:29:49.977 --> 03:29:51.979
BE CREATIVE WITH SOME OF THE

03:29:52.046 --> 03:29:53.480
WITH SOME OF THE REIMBURSEMENT

03:29:53.547 --> 03:29:54.248
METHODS THAT WE'VE ALREADY

03:29:54.315 --> 03:29:55.482
THOUGHT ABOUT HERE IN

03:29:55.549 --> 03:29:57.518
CALIFORNIA. WE SET THAT STAGE.

03:29:57.584 --> 03:29:59.920
LET'S KEEP IT GOING. THANK YOU

03:29:59.987 --> 03:30:02.656
VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD

03:30:02.723 --> 03:30:03.791
AFTERNOON. LARA LANE, ON BEHALF

03:30:03.857 --> 03:30:05.993
OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

03:30:06.060 --> 03:30:07.094
PUBLIC HOSPITALS. THANK YOU,

03:30:07.161 --> 03:30:08.595
CHAIRMAN AND CHAIR, FOR

03:30:08.662 --> 03:30:09.596
CONVENING THIS HEARING AND FOR

03:30:09.663 --> 03:30:11.231
YOUR LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING

03:30:11.298 --> 03:30:13.233
THE SERIOUS CONCERNS FACING OUR

03:30:13.300 --> 03:30:14.201
PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE

03:30:14.268 --> 03:30:16.236
SYSTEMS. H.R. ONE, AS YOU HEARD,

03:30:16.303 --> 03:30:18.238
CUTS NEARLY $1 TRILLION FROM

03:30:18.305 --> 03:30:19.707
MEDICAID OVER TEN YEARS. THAT'S

03:30:19.773 --> 03:30:22.142
ABOUT $250 MILLION EVERY DAY

03:30:22.209 --> 03:30:23.711
RIPPED FROM HEALTH CARE FUNDING

03:30:23.777 --> 03:30:25.813
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. H.R. ONE

03:30:25.879 --> 03:30:27.581
THREATENS THE FOUNDATION OF

03:30:27.648 --> 03:30:29.049
CALIFORNIA'S SAFETY NET SYSTEMS.

03:30:29.116 --> 03:30:30.784
OUR 17 PUBLIC HEALTH CARE

03:30:30.851 --> 03:30:33.253
SYSTEMS SERVE 3 MILLION PATIENTS

03:30:33.320 --> 03:30:34.722
WITH 10 MILLION OUTPATIENT

03:30:34.788 --> 03:30:37.057
VISITS ANNUALLY, PROVIDING 35%

03:30:37.124 --> 03:30:38.792
OF ALL MEDI-CAL AND UNINSURED

03:30:38.859 --> 03:30:40.861
HOSPITAL CARE, AND RUNNING OVER

03:30:40.928 --> 03:30:42.096
HALF THE STATE'S HIGHEST LEVEL

03:30:42.162 --> 03:30:44.098
TRAUMA AND BURN CENTERS. THE

03:30:44.164 --> 03:30:46.233
FINANCIAL IMPACT IS DEVASTATING.

03:30:46.300 --> 03:30:49.169
BY 2032, JUST THE IMPACT OF

03:30:49.236 --> 03:30:51.372
STATE DIRECTED PAYMENT CUTS,

03:30:51.438 --> 03:30:52.840
WHICH WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT

03:30:52.906 --> 03:30:56.210
TODAY, WILL RESULT IN A $2.3

03:30:56.276 --> 03:30:58.545
BILLION NET LOSS ANNUALLY TO OUR

03:30:58.612 --> 03:30:59.913
SYSTEMS. WHEN COMBINED WITH

03:30:59.980 --> 03:31:01.682
OTHER LOOMING FEDERAL CUTS AND

03:31:01.749 --> 03:31:03.584
STATE BUDGET CUTS TO PROGRAMS

03:31:03.650 --> 03:31:05.386
SERVING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS,

03:31:05.452 --> 03:31:08.155
WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE THAN $7

03:31:08.222 --> 03:31:10.391
BILLION IN LOST FUNDING ANNUALLY

03:31:10.457 --> 03:31:12.192
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SERVING

03:31:12.259 --> 03:31:13.694
MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL UNINSURED

03:31:13.761 --> 03:31:16.130
PATIENTS. H.R. ONE ELIGIBILITY

03:31:16.196 --> 03:31:17.498
CHANGES COULD STRIP COVERAGE

03:31:17.564 --> 03:31:20.467
FROM UP TO 3.4 MILLION MEDI-CAL

03:31:20.534 --> 03:31:22.269
MEMBERS, CREATING A SURGE IN

03:31:22.336 --> 03:31:24.204
UNCOMPENSATED CARE PRECISELY

03:31:24.271 --> 03:31:25.539
WHEN OUR FUNDING IS BEING

03:31:25.606 --> 03:31:28.709
SLASHED. THIS ISN'T THEORETICAL.

03:31:28.776 --> 03:31:30.878
CLOSURES, SERVICE CUTS AND

03:31:30.944 --> 03:31:31.979
LAYOFFS ARE PRACTICALLY

03:31:32.046 --> 03:31:33.547
GUARANTEED, AND THE COLLAPSE

03:31:33.614 --> 03:31:34.915
WILL CASCADE FAR BEYOND OUR

03:31:34.982 --> 03:31:36.283
PUBLIC SYSTEMS TO OVERWHELM

03:31:36.350 --> 03:31:38.118
EVERY HOSPITAL, CLINIC AND

03:31:38.185 --> 03:31:40.254
EMERGENCY ROOM IN THE STATE. WE

03:31:40.320 --> 03:31:42.456
NEED YOUR PARTNERSHIP TO DEVELOP

03:31:42.523 --> 03:31:43.424
STRATEGIES THAT PRESERVE

03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:45.993
COVERAGE, PROTECT PATIENTS, AND

03:31:46.060 --> 03:31:47.661
PREVENT FURTHER CUTS TO

03:31:47.728 --> 03:31:48.295
CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE SAFETY

03:31:48.362 --> 03:31:51.131
NET SYSTEM. FURTHER, WE URGE YOU

03:31:51.198 --> 03:31:52.132
TO REAFFIRM AND STRENGTHEN

03:31:52.199 --> 03:31:53.467
CALIFORNIA PROTECTIONS THAT KEEP

03:31:53.534 --> 03:31:55.736
HEALTHCARE SETTINGS SAFE FOR ALL

03:31:55.803 --> 03:31:57.905
PATIENTS AND HELP US WORK TO

03:31:57.971 --> 03:31:58.572
REBUILD THE TRUST WITH FAMILIES

03:31:58.639 --> 03:32:01.108
IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE STILL

03:32:01.175 --> 03:32:03.010
AFRAID TO SEEK CARE. THANK YOU

03:32:03.077 --> 03:32:05.813
SO MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD

03:32:05.879 --> 03:32:07.214
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIRS AND

03:32:07.281 --> 03:32:08.982
MEMBER CONNIE DELGADO, ON BEHALF

03:32:09.049 --> 03:32:10.150
OF THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL

03:32:10.217 --> 03:32:11.618
LEADERSHIP FORUM, THESE ARE THE

03:32:11.685 --> 03:32:13.120
33 DISTRICT MUNICIPAL HOSPITALS

03:32:13.187 --> 03:32:14.922
IN THE STATE. TWO THIRDS OF

03:32:14.988 --> 03:32:16.156
THESE HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED IN

03:32:16.223 --> 03:32:17.958
RURAL COMMUNITIES, AND 18 OF

03:32:18.025 --> 03:32:20.027
THEM HAVE CRITICAL ACCESS

03:32:20.094 --> 03:32:21.428
DESIGNATION. I JUST WANTED TO

03:32:21.495 --> 03:32:22.863
ADD VERY QUICKLY, I KNOW THAT

03:32:22.930 --> 03:32:24.898
YOU DID MENTION DISTRESSED

03:32:24.965 --> 03:32:26.133
HOSPITALS AND KIND OF THE

03:32:26.200 --> 03:32:28.368
CURRENT STATE. I WANT TO LET YOU

03:32:28.435 --> 03:32:29.136
KNOW THAT THESE HOSPITALS

03:32:29.203 --> 03:32:31.772
RECEIVED 50% OF THE POT THAT WAS

03:32:31.839 --> 03:32:32.806
ALLOCATED FOR THE DISTRESSED

03:32:32.873 --> 03:32:35.709
HOSPITAL FUND. SO THESE

03:32:35.776 --> 03:32:38.178
HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING NOW.

03:32:38.245 --> 03:32:39.880
H.R. ONE WILL JEOPARDIZE THE

03:32:39.947 --> 03:32:41.081
FUTURE OF THESE HOSPITALS,

03:32:41.148 --> 03:32:42.583
INCREASING THE UNINSURED

03:32:42.649 --> 03:32:43.217
POPULATIONS, WHICH WE'VE HEARD A

03:32:43.283 --> 03:32:44.885
LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT TODAY IN

03:32:44.952 --> 03:32:46.587
THE COMMUNITIES, WHILE CUTTING

03:32:46.653 --> 03:32:47.955
MEDI-CAL FUNDING STREAMS THAT

03:32:48.021 --> 03:32:49.556
SERVE ALL LIFELINES FOR RURAL

03:32:49.623 --> 03:32:51.458
AND SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. THESE

03:32:51.525 --> 03:32:53.861
FEDERAL CHANGES ARE RAPIDLY,

03:32:53.927 --> 03:32:55.529
RAPIDLY APPROACHING. AND WHILE

03:32:55.596 --> 03:32:56.997
HOSPITALS ARE DOING EVERYTHING

03:32:57.064 --> 03:32:59.466
POSSIBLE TO PREPARE, THEY ARE

03:32:59.533 --> 03:33:00.634
SIMULTANEOUSLY GRAPPLING WITH

03:33:00.701 --> 03:33:02.603
STATE BUDGET REDUCTIONS AND NEW

03:33:02.669 --> 03:33:04.104
MANDATES THAT INCREASE COSTS

03:33:04.171 --> 03:33:06.974
WITHOUT PROVIDING FUNDING. THIS

03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:08.308
COMBINATION MAKES SURVIVAL

03:33:08.375 --> 03:33:10.577
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HOSPITALS

03:33:10.644 --> 03:33:12.179
ALREADY OPERATING ON THE

03:33:12.246 --> 03:33:13.480
THINNEST OF MARGINS. WE'RE

03:33:13.547 --> 03:33:15.349
TALKING, YOU KNOW, MINIMAL DAYS,

03:33:15.415 --> 03:33:17.050
CASH ON HAND. WE DISCUSSED THIS

03:33:17.117 --> 03:33:22.289
IN VARIOUS. FORUMS WHEN A WHEN A

03:33:22.356 --> 03:33:23.590
DISTRICT HOSPITAL CLOSES,

03:33:23.657 --> 03:33:26.660
PATIENTS LOSE LOCAL ACCESS TO

03:33:26.727 --> 03:33:28.662
EMERGENCY AND INPATIENT CARE

03:33:28.729 --> 03:33:30.063
COMMUNITIES LOSE THEIR LARGEST

03:33:30.130 --> 03:33:31.832
EMPLOYER, WHICH WE'VE HAD

03:33:31.899 --> 03:33:33.267
CONVERSATIONS TODAY ABOUT THE

03:33:33.333 --> 03:33:34.301
WORKFORCE AND THE STATE LOSES

03:33:34.368 --> 03:33:36.203
CRITICAL HEALTH CARE

03:33:36.270 --> 03:33:37.237
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WANT TO URGE

03:33:37.304 --> 03:33:39.072
THE LEGISLATURE TO STAND WITH

03:33:39.139 --> 03:33:41.642
US, OPPOSE FEDERAL CUTS, AVOID

03:33:41.708 --> 03:33:43.644
ADDING ADDITIONAL UNFUNDED

03:33:43.710 --> 03:33:44.845
MANDATES AS THEY MOVE THROUGH

03:33:44.912 --> 03:33:46.613
THE LEGISLATURE, AND PARTNER

03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:47.915
WITH US ON SOLUTIONS THAT

03:33:47.981 --> 03:33:50.150
PRESERVE ACCESS TO CARE IN RURAL

03:33:50.217 --> 03:33:51.985
AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND

03:33:52.052 --> 03:33:53.720
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS

03:33:53.787 --> 03:33:56.990
CONVERSATION. HELLO. MY NAME IS

03:33:57.057 --> 03:33:59.459
BEATRICE HERNANDEZ, AND I'M HERE

03:33:59.526 --> 03:34:00.360
WITH THE HEALTH COALITION. I'M

03:34:00.427 --> 03:34:02.129
AN UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIAN. I

03:34:02.196 --> 03:34:04.198
DON'T HAVE DACA, AND I'M FULLY

03:34:04.264 --> 03:34:05.699
UNDOCUMENTED. THROUGH THE

03:34:05.766 --> 03:34:07.067
MEDI-CAL EXPANSION FOR

03:34:07.134 --> 03:34:08.235
UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS, I WAS

03:34:08.302 --> 03:34:10.470
ABLE TO AVOID PAYING THOUSANDS

03:34:10.537 --> 03:34:11.805
OF DOLLARS FOR MY UNIVERSITIES

03:34:11.872 --> 03:34:14.041
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE

03:34:14.107 --> 03:34:16.176
I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO HAVE MY

03:34:16.243 --> 03:34:18.679
OWN COVERAGE. THAT IS WHY I'M SO

03:34:18.745 --> 03:34:20.113
ALARMED BY THE ROLLBACKS WE'RE

03:34:20.180 --> 03:34:22.282
SEEING. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT

03:34:22.349 --> 03:34:24.418
UNTIL HARM HAPPENS BEFORE TAKING

03:34:24.484 --> 03:34:26.253
ACTION. THIS YEAR, THE

03:34:26.320 --> 03:34:28.355
LEGISLATURE ONLY APPROVED LEGAL

03:34:28.422 --> 03:34:31.225
SERVICES FUNDING AFTER ICE RAIDS

03:34:31.291 --> 03:34:33.126
AND KIDNAPINGS STARTED TO HAPPEN

03:34:33.193 --> 03:34:35.195
IN LA. PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE

03:34:35.262 --> 03:34:37.097
SAME MISTAKE WITH HEALTH CARE.

03:34:37.164 --> 03:34:38.832
WE NEED YOU TO RESTORE HEALTH

03:34:38.899 --> 03:34:40.334
FOR ALL MEDI-CAL FOR

03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:41.602
UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS WITH

03:34:41.668 --> 03:34:43.937
NO ROLLBACKS. BEFORE WE START

03:34:44.004 --> 03:34:45.839
SEEING DEVASTATING IMPACTS

03:34:45.906 --> 03:34:48.542
ACROSS OUR STATE. AND FINALLY, I

03:34:48.609 --> 03:34:50.744

CONVERSATION OF RELIEF AND KIND

03:35:25.812 --> 03:35:27.547
OF HOW TO WORK TOGETHER FOR THE

03:35:27.614 --> 03:35:29.216
FUTURE. WE ALL NEED TO WORK

03:35:29.283 --> 03:35:31.051
TOGETHER TO FIND THOSE

03:35:31.118 --> 03:35:32.452
OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE THAT

03:35:32.519 --> 03:35:34.288
NEEDED RELIEF AND SUPPORT FOR

03:35:34.354 --> 03:35:35.622
OUR COMMUNITY HOSPITALS, TO HELP

03:35:35.689 --> 03:35:39.559
THEM SURVIVE AND CARE FOR OUR

VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THANK

03:35:40.227 --> 03:35:43.297

ADDITION TO MY COLLEAGUES

03:35:52.639 --> 03:35:54.007
TESTIMONY TODAY, WE OPPOSE

03:35:54.074 --> 03:35:56.343
HOSTILE FEDERAL ICE AND DATA

03:35:56.410 --> 03:35:57.711
INTRUSION ACTIONS THAT WILL

03:35:57.778 --> 03:35:58.779
INSTILL FEAR WITHIN OUR

03:35:58.845 --> 03:36:00.447
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. AND WE

03:36:00.514 --> 03:36:02.349
OPPOSE H.R. ONE FUNDING CUTS

03:36:02.416 --> 03:36:03.884
TARGETED AT IMMIGRANTS AND URGE

03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:05.886
THE STATE TO STEP UP TO FILL IN

03:36:05.952 --> 03:36:07.254
THE WIDENING GAP COVERAGE GAPS

03:36:07.321 --> 03:36:09.156
IN THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET AND

03:36:09.222 --> 03:36:11.325
AS A RESULT OF FEDERAL ACTIONS,

03:36:11.391 --> 03:36:13.026
WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE TODAY FACE

03:36:13.093 --> 03:36:15.395
NUMEROUS CHALLENGES IN ACCESSING

03:36:15.462 --> 03:36:17.097
MEDI-CAL, INCLUDING LANGUAGE

03:36:17.164 --> 03:36:18.965
BARRIERS, COMPLEX PAPERWORK

03:36:19.032 --> 03:36:20.300
REQUIREMENTS, AND MISINFORMATION

03:36:20.367 --> 03:36:22.235
DURING RENEWAL PROCESSES, WHICH

03:36:22.302 --> 03:36:24.738
WILL BE EXACERBATED. WE URGE THE

03:36:24.805 --> 03:36:25.739
LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT POLICIES

03:36:25.806 --> 03:36:27.908
THAT MINIMIZE THE HARMS OF H.R.

03:36:27.974 --> 03:36:29.876
ONE AND REDUCE BARRIERS TO

03:36:29.943 --> 03:36:30.877
CALIFORNIANS ABILITY TO KEEP

03:36:30.944 --> 03:36:32.946
THEIR HEALTH CARE, REGARDLESS OF

03:36:33.013 --> 03:36:34.981
IMMIGRATION STATUS. A SPECIFIC

03:36:35.048 --> 03:36:37.351
POLICY SOLUTION TO MITIGATE H.R.

03:36:37.417 --> 03:36:38.318
ONE IMPACTS IS TO SIMPLIFY

03:36:38.385 --> 03:36:40.120
TODAY'S CURRENTLY BURDENSOME

03:36:40.187 --> 03:36:41.888
MANUAL PROCESSES BY

RE-IMPLEMENTING THE MEDI-CAL

03:36:43.056 --> 03:36:44.524
WINDING FLEXIBILITIES, WHICH

03:36:44.591 --> 03:36:46.259
HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO INCREASE

03:36:46.326 --> 03:36:48.095
AUTOMATIC RENEWALS AND REDUCE

03:36:48.161 --> 03:36:49.429
PROCEDURAL TERMINATIONS. WE LOOK

03:36:49.496 --> 03:36:52.366
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.

03:36:52.432 --> 03:36:54.434
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON.

03:36:54.501 --> 03:36:57.104
CHAIRS AND MEMBERS. H.R. ONE IS

03:36:57.170 --> 03:36:58.105
OMAR AL-TAMIMI WITH THE

CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH

03:36:59.439 --> 03:37:01.007
NETWORK. H.R. ONE IS A SERIOUS

03:37:01.074 --> 03:37:02.709
THREAT TO THE HEALTH CARE OF

03:37:02.776 --> 03:37:03.643
CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE

03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:04.745
POPULATIONS, THREATENING TO

03:37:04.811 --> 03:37:06.413
EXACERBATE DISPARITIES FACED BY

03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:07.547
CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS AND

03:37:07.614 --> 03:37:08.982
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

03:37:09.049 --> 03:37:10.417
POLICYMAKERS MUST STAND READY TO

03:37:10.484 --> 03:37:12.152
DEVELOP CREATIVE POLICY

03:37:12.219 --> 03:37:13.520
SOLUTIONS SOLUTIONS SUCH AS

03:37:13.587 --> 03:37:15.122
AUTOMATION, IN ORDER TO MITIGATE

03:37:15.188 --> 03:37:16.356
THE DAMAGING PROVISIONS OF H.R.

03:37:16.423 --> 03:37:18.291
ONE, WHICH SEEK TO UNDERMINE AND

03:37:18.358 --> 03:37:19.860
DESTROY OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

03:37:19.926 --> 03:37:21.528
BY ADDING UNNECESSARY

03:37:21.595 --> 03:37:22.295
ADMINISTRATIVE HURDLES TO

03:37:22.362 --> 03:37:23.864
MAINTAINING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE

03:37:23.930 --> 03:37:25.932
ON TOP OF CUTS THE LEGISLATURE

03:37:25.999 --> 03:37:26.967
MADE LARGELY TO IMMIGRANT

03:37:27.033 --> 03:37:28.468
FAMILIES. IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET,

03:37:28.535 --> 03:37:29.870
H.R. ONE WILL MEAN MORE PEOPLE

03:37:29.936 --> 03:37:31.972
LOSING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AS A

03:37:32.038 --> 03:37:32.806
RESULT OF BURDENSOME NEW

03:37:32.873 --> 03:37:35.242
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL

03:37:35.308 --> 03:37:36.676
UNFAIRLY TARGET WOMEN AND

03:37:36.743 --> 03:37:37.811
CAREGIVERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE

03:37:37.878 --> 03:37:38.912
ALREADY WORKING. AS A RESULT,

03:37:38.979 --> 03:37:40.247
PEOPLE WILL BE LIVING SICKER AND

03:37:40.313 --> 03:37:42.115
DYING UNNECESSARILY FROM

03:37:42.182 --> 03:37:43.583
ILLNESSES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

03:37:43.650 --> 03:37:44.684
PREVENTED. IT EXPANDS THE

03:37:44.751 --> 03:37:46.520
CATEGORIES OF IMMIGRANTS

03:37:46.586 --> 03:37:47.087
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING

03:37:47.154 --> 03:37:48.655
THOSE CONSIDERED TO BE UI'S,

03:37:48.722 --> 03:37:49.689
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS ALSO

03:37:49.756 --> 03:37:51.024
BAKED INTO THE STATE BUDGET

03:37:51.091 --> 03:37:52.526
ELIGIBILITY CHANGES, AND IT

03:37:52.592 --> 03:37:53.960
CHANGES HOW PROVIDER TAXES CAN

03:37:54.027 --> 03:37:55.495
BE LEVERAGED AND RAISES

03:37:55.562 --> 03:37:57.564
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER PROP 35

03:37:57.631 --> 03:37:58.665
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE

03:37:58.732 --> 03:37:59.232
IMPLEMENTED AS WRITTEN, OR

03:37:59.299 --> 03:38:01.201
WHETHER WE MUST GO BACK TO THE

03:38:01.268 --> 03:38:02.502
VOTERS VOTERS TO AVOID

03:38:02.569 --> 03:38:04.104
ADDITIONAL CUTS TO ACCESS TO

03:38:04.171 --> 03:38:05.539
HEALTHCARE IN THE FUTURE. THESE

03:38:05.605 --> 03:38:06.473
CHANGES AND DISRUPTIONS TO THE

03:38:06.540 --> 03:38:08.074
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WILL ALSO

03:38:08.141 --> 03:38:09.209
MEAN MORE CALIFORNIANS END UP

03:38:09.276 --> 03:38:10.877
WITH MEDICAL DEBT. WE'RE GOING

03:38:10.944 --> 03:38:13.146
TO NEED POLICYMAKERS TO FOCUS ON

03:38:13.213 --> 03:38:14.047
MAKING SURE WE MAINTAIN A STRONG

03:38:14.114 --> 03:38:15.115
SAFETY NET FOR THOSE WHO NEED

03:38:15.182 --> 03:38:17.517
IT. AS WE WORK TOWARDS

03:38:17.584 --> 03:38:18.285
IMPLEMENTING H.R. ONE, WE NEED

03:38:18.351 --> 03:38:18.785
POLICYMAKERS WHO PUT THE

03:38:18.852 --> 03:38:20.153
HEALTHCARE OF CALIFORNIANS

03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:21.288
FIRST. WE MUST PUT PEOPLE'S

03:38:21.354 --> 03:38:23.123
HEALTH BEFORE PROFITS, INCREASE

03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:24.224
REVENUE, AND LOOK TO ALTERNATIVE

03:38:24.291 --> 03:38:26.026
FUNDING SOURCES, WHILE WE ALSO

03:38:26.092 --> 03:38:28.495
HOLD INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE TO

03:38:28.562 --> 03:38:30.497
KEEP ACCESS AND COVERAGE INTACT.

03:38:30.564 --> 03:38:33.934
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON.

03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:35.302
AMANDA. ON BEHALF OF COUNTY

03:38:35.368 --> 03:38:37.003
WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION, I

03:38:37.070 --> 03:38:38.305
WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND

03:38:38.371 --> 03:38:40.173
YOUR STAFF FOR PUTTING ON THIS

03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:42.242
REALLY IMPORTANT HEARING. AS

03:38:42.309 --> 03:38:43.243
COUNTIES, WE ARE GOING TO BE ON

03:38:43.310 --> 03:38:45.378
THE FRONT LINES OF THE

03:38:45.445 --> 03:38:46.046
IMPLEMENTATION OF H.R. ONE, AND

03:38:46.112 --> 03:38:47.547
WE'RE GOING TO SEE FIRSTHAND ALL

03:38:47.614 --> 03:38:49.149
OF THESE POLICY DECISIONS COMING

03:38:49.216 --> 03:38:51.117
INTO EFFECT. THERE ARE A FEW

03:38:51.184 --> 03:38:52.652
THINGS, MORE THAN A FEW THINGS

03:38:52.719 --> 03:38:54.421
THAT WE THINK ARE GOING TO BE

03:38:54.488 --> 03:38:55.622
CHALLENGES THAT I'D LIKE TO

03:38:55.689 --> 03:38:57.324
HIGHLIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, OF

03:38:57.390 --> 03:38:59.125
COURSE, IS GOING TO BE THE WORK

03:38:59.192 --> 03:39:00.961
REQUIREMENTS. AND MAKING SURE

03:39:01.027 --> 03:39:03.497
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE

03:39:03.563 --> 03:39:06.466
DATA BETWEEN KELSO'S FOR OUR

03:39:06.533 --> 03:39:08.134
MEDI-CAL WORK REQUIREMENTS

03:39:08.201 --> 03:39:11.037
ALONGSIDE CALFRESH AND CALWORKS.

03:39:11.104 --> 03:39:14.241
BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:39:14.307 --> 03:39:16.109
THOSE PROGRAMS WORK TOGETHER,

03:39:16.176 --> 03:39:18.078
AND THAT AS THE COMPLEXITY

03:39:18.144 --> 03:39:20.747
BUILDS FOR MEDI-CAL, WE ARE ALSO

03:39:20.814 --> 03:39:22.716
BEING ABLE TO TRAIN OUR

03:39:22.782 --> 03:39:24.017
WORKFORCE. AS THIS PROGRAM

03:39:24.084 --> 03:39:25.485
BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED, IT'S

03:39:25.552 --> 03:39:27.120
MORE COMPLICATED FOR OUR STAFF

03:39:27.187 --> 03:39:28.955
TO IMPLEMENT. IT BECOMES MORE

03:39:29.022 --> 03:39:30.824
DIFFICULT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS TO

03:39:30.891 --> 03:39:32.225
MEET THE NEEDS AND THE

03:39:32.292 --> 03:39:34.427
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. AND SO

03:39:34.494 --> 03:39:35.962
PART OF AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN

03:39:36.029 --> 03:39:38.031
OUT OF THAT IS ALSO THE TIMING

03:39:38.098 --> 03:39:38.865
OF THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT

03:39:38.932 --> 03:39:41.601
SHOULD BE COMING DOWN. WE ARE

03:39:41.668 --> 03:39:43.803
NOT PARTICULARLY NIMBLE WHEN

03:39:43.870 --> 03:39:44.938
IMPLEMENTING THINGS, ESPECIALLY

03:39:45.005 --> 03:39:46.973
NEW THINGS LIKE THIS. AND IT'S

03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:48.441
REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE

03:39:48.508 --> 03:39:50.243
ENOUGH TIMING TO DO THIS RIGHT.

03:39:50.310 --> 03:39:52.045
AND SO BY DOING SO, WE'LL BE

03:39:52.112 --> 03:39:53.580
ABLE TO HOPEFULLY MITIGATE SOME

03:39:53.647 --> 03:39:55.282
OF THAT CHURN THAT I KNOW THE

03:39:55.348 --> 03:39:57.050
DIRECTOR WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT

03:39:57.117 --> 03:39:59.119
YOU HAVE MENTIONED, AND MAKING

03:39:59.185 --> 03:40:00.554
SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T JUST

03:40:00.620 --> 03:40:02.122
FALLING OFF FOR PAPERWORK OR

03:40:02.188 --> 03:40:04.591
PROCEDURAL REASONS. I ALSO WANT

03:40:04.658 --> 03:40:06.793
TO HIGHLIGHT, OF COURSE, THERE

03:40:06.860 --> 03:40:08.662
ARE CHALLENGES BETWEEN OUR STATE

03:40:08.728 --> 03:40:11.932
AND FEDERAL BUDGET AND THE

03:40:11.998 --> 03:40:14.434
FREEZE COMING UP IN 2026. THAT'S

03:40:14.501 --> 03:40:16.603
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM AS WELL.

03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:19.139
AND JUST GENERALLY ANY OF THE

03:40:19.205 --> 03:40:20.473
FUTURE POLICY SHIFTS THAT MAY

03:40:20.540 --> 03:40:22.475
ALSO COME DOWN BECAUSE OF H.R.

03:40:22.542 --> 03:40:24.110
ONE OR FROM THE FEDERAL

03:40:24.177 --> 03:40:25.111
GOVERNMENT. WE WILL HAVE TO, OF

03:40:25.178 --> 03:40:27.047
COURSE, IMPLEMENT THOSE AS THEY

03:40:27.113 --> 03:40:29.149
COME OUT. AND THAT WILL ALSO

03:40:29.215 --> 03:40:31.985
IMPACT HOW WE WORK WITH OUR

03:40:32.052 --> 03:40:33.887
CUSTOMERS. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING

03:40:33.954 --> 03:40:36.156
FOR AND HOPING THAT WE CAN WORK

03:40:36.222 --> 03:40:36.823
WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON IS BEING

03:40:36.890 --> 03:40:38.625
ABLE TO DESIGN THE WORK

03:40:38.692 --> 03:40:40.193
REQUIREMENTS AND THE AUTOMATION

03:40:40.260 --> 03:40:41.928
PROCESSES TO LEVERAGE THE DATA

03:40:41.995 --> 03:40:43.563
SHARING ACROSS CALWORKS,

03:40:43.630 --> 03:40:45.165
CALFRESH, AND MEDI-CAL. WE'RE

03:40:45.231 --> 03:40:48.969
ALSO HOPING TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL

03:40:49.035 --> 03:40:50.136
FLEXIBILITIES THAT WILL BE

03:40:50.203 --> 03:40:53.406
ALLOWED. THANK YOU. HI, MY NAME

03:40:53.473 --> 03:40:55.075
IS MANDY DIAZ. I'M WITH

SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOURCE ACTION

03:40:56.209 --> 03:40:59.079
CENTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

03:40:59.145 --> 03:41:00.347
HOLDING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT

03:47:26.966 --> 03:47:29.335
COMING. I WANTED TO SAY THANK

03:47:29.402 --> 03:47:31.671
YOU FOR RAISING THE CONCERNS OF

03:47:31.738 --> 03:47:32.605
THIS HEARING TODAY ABOUT THE

03:47:32.672 --> 03:47:35.141
IMPACTS OF H.R. ONE, THE FEDERAL

03:47:35.208 --> 03:47:36.776
IMMIGRATION RAIDS, AND JUST THIS

03:47:36.843 --> 03:47:39.579
GENERAL SENSE OF FEAR THAT IS

03:47:39.645 --> 03:47:41.781
NOW PERVADING THE STATE OF

03:47:41.848 --> 03:47:43.716
CALIFORNIA. IT'S NOT A SCENARIO

03:47:43.783 --> 03:47:46.052
WE EVER ENVISIONED COULD HAPPEN.

03:47:46.119 --> 03:47:48.888
AND YET IT IS. WE WORRY ABOUT,

03:47:48.955 --> 03:47:51.157
OF COURSE, FOLKS NOT ACCESSING

03:47:51.224 --> 03:47:52.258
THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED AND

03:47:52.325 --> 03:47:54.360
THE IMPACTS ON PROVIDERS, BUT OF

03:47:54.427 --> 03:47:55.728
COURSE, ALSO THE IMPACTS ON

03:47:55.795 --> 03:47:57.997
PUBLIC HEALTH. YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC

03:47:58.064 --> 03:48:00.066
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE ALREADY

03:48:00.133 --> 03:48:02.235
FACING CUTS AND LAYOFFS FROM

03:48:02.301 --> 03:48:04.037
SEPARATE FEDERAL ACTIONS FROM

03:48:04.103 --> 03:48:08.441
H.R. ONE AND IMMIGRATION RAIDS.

03:48:08.508 --> 03:48:09.709
AND THE GREATEST CONCERN, OUR

03:48:09.776 --> 03:48:11.110
GREATEST CONCERN ON ALL OF ALL

03:48:11.177 --> 03:48:15.148
OF THESE THINGS IS HOW WE CAN DO

03:48:15.214 --> 03:48:16.916
OUR CORE MISSION, WHICH IS

03:48:16.983 --> 03:48:18.484
IDENTIFYING, PREVENTING AND

03:48:18.551 --> 03:48:20.253
RESPONDING TO COMMUNICABLE

03:48:20.319 --> 03:48:22.655
DISEASE. WHEN YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC

03:48:22.722 --> 03:48:24.924
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE FORCED TO

03:48:24.991 --> 03:48:27.460
MOVE SLOWER LIKE THEY ARE NOW,

03:48:27.527 --> 03:48:29.262
COMMUNICABLE DISEASE MOVES MORE

03:48:29.328 --> 03:48:31.798
QUICKLY AND THAT'S OUR MAIN

03:48:31.864 --> 03:48:33.599
CONCERN. WE THANK THE

03:48:33.666 --> 03:48:34.867

03:48:34.934 --> 03:48:36.869
THEIR RECENT INVESTMENTS IN THE

03:48:36.936 --> 03:48:37.437
FUTURE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

03:48:37.503 --> 03:48:38.771

03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:44.744
TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ACCESS THE

03:48:44.811 --> 03:48:46.946
CARE THEY NEED, AND WE KEEP OUR

APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF A

03:50:04.023 --> 03:50:06.125
HEALTH CENTER LEADER WHO IS A

03:50:06.192 --> 03:50:07.226

50 EVENTS AND ACTIVATED

03:50:20.540 --> 03:50:21.874
THOUSANDS OF SEIU MEMBERS TO NOT

ONLY EDUCATE THEM ON THE THREAT

03:50:23.342 --> 03:50:25.244

03:50:37.123 --> 03:50:38.491
WITH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

03:50:38.558 --> 03:50:39.091
ACTIONS, ARE MAKING OUR

03:50:39.158 --> 03:50:40.660
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES INTO

03:50:40.726 --> 03:50:42.428
PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR ZONES. THIS IS

03:50:42.495 --> 03:50:43.896
NOT CONDUCIVE TO HEALING AND

03:50:43.963 --> 03:50:45.464
DOES NOT ALLOW US TO MANAGE

03:50:45.531 --> 03:50:46.499
CHRONIC DISEASES OR HELPING

03:50:46.566 --> 03:50:47.900
MOTHER PREPARE FOR THE BIRTH OF

03:50:47.967 --> 03:50:50.069

ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION, H.R. ONE

03:51:34.380 --> 03:51:36.449
IMPACTS OUR CALIFORNIA'S RURAL

03:51:36.515 --> 03:51:38.384
MIGRANT FARMWORKERS ACCESS TO

03:51:38.451 --> 03:51:40.286
VITAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. AND

03:51:40.353 --> 03:51:42.521
IT'S DRASTIC. THESE BAD FEDERAL

03:51:42.588 --> 03:51:43.623
CHANGES, COUPLED WITH

03:51:43.689 --> 03:51:45.791
IMMIGRATION RAIDS, CAUSES FEAR,

03:51:45.858 --> 03:51:47.627
STRESS, AND UNCERTAINTY IN OUR

03:51:47.693 --> 03:51:49.395
RURAL FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES,

03:51:49.462 --> 03:51:51.897
AFFECTING THEIR ECONOMIC, SOCIAL

03:51:51.964 --> 03:51:53.699
HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE STATE

03:51:53.766 --> 03:51:55.935
BUDGET CUTS TO THE MEDI-CAL

03:51:56.002 --> 03:51:58.104
PROGRAM IS A HUGE STEP BACK FROM

03:51:58.170 --> 03:51:59.505
THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO

03:51:59.572 --> 03:52:01.007
FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES,

03:52:01.073 --> 03:52:01.974
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION

03:52:02.041 --> 03:52:04.210
STATUS. THIS WHILE WE STILL HAVE

03:52:04.277 --> 03:52:06.012
MORE GAPS TO WORK ON TO CLOSE

03:52:06.078 --> 03:52:08.381
THE UNINSURED GAP ESTIMATES ARE

03:52:08.447 --> 03:52:09.815
36% OF FARMWORKERS RECEIVE

03:52:09.882 --> 03:52:12.051
MEDI-CAL THAT COVERS MORE THAN

03:52:12.118 --> 03:52:14.587
300,000 STATEWIDE. THE AG

03:52:14.654 --> 03:52:15.921
INDUSTRY BENEFITS FROM HAVING

03:52:15.988 --> 03:52:17.857
FARMWORKERS ON MEDI-CAL. IF THEY

03:52:17.923 --> 03:52:19.225
WERE TO COVER FARMWORKERS, IT

03:52:19.292 --> 03:52:22.561
WOULD COST AN ESTIMATED $2.5

03:52:22.628 --> 03:52:24.163
BILLION ANNUALLY. WE CAN'T

03:52:24.230 --> 03:52:26.565
SOLELY RELY ON THE AG INDUSTRY

03:52:26.632 --> 03:52:28.601
TO COVER FARMWORKERS. AS A

03:52:28.668 --> 03:52:29.935
RESULT, A RETURN TO HIGH

03:52:30.002 --> 03:52:32.571
UNINSURED RATES AND POOR HEALTH

03:52:32.638 --> 03:52:34.974
ACCESS AND OUTCOMES IS VERY

03:52:35.041 --> 03:52:37.476
LIKELY TO HAVE ON FARMWORKERS

03:52:37.543 --> 03:52:39.445
FROM KEEPING AND MAINTAINING OR

03:52:39.512 --> 03:52:41.547

OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

03:52:59.432 --> 03:53:01.067
HEALTH PLANS. THE MEDICAL

03:53:01.133 --> 03:53:02.802
PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT TO ALL

03:53:02.868 --> 03:53:03.869
CALIFORNIANS, AND ITS VALUE

03:53:03.936 --> 03:53:07.073
EXTENDS TO ALL OUR COMMUNITIES.

COVERAGE IN ALL 58 COUNTIES, AND

03:53:12.345 --> 03:53:13.979
WE HAVE FIRSTHAND VIEW OF THE

03:53:14.046 --> 03:53:15.114
IMPORTANCE OF MEDI-CAL TO OUR

03:53:15.181 --> 03:53:16.849
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IT IS

03:53:16.916 --> 03:53:18.684
CRUCIAL FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE

03:53:18.751 --> 03:53:21.187
AND WORKING FAMILIES. WITHOUT

03:53:21.253 --> 03:53:22.688
NECESSARY HEALTH CARE, MANY WILL

03:53:22.755 --> 03:53:24.490
END UP IN EMERGENCY ROOM. THIS

03:53:24.557 --> 03:53:26.258
IS NOT. THIS NOT ONLY CREATES

03:53:26.325 --> 03:53:27.259
UNCOMPENSATED CARE, BUT ALSO

03:53:27.326 --> 03:53:28.694
DRIVES UP THE COST FOR EVERYONE

03:53:28.761 --> 03:53:30.496
IN THE SYSTEM. HEALTH PLANS ARE

03:53:30.563 --> 03:53:32.298

03:53:57.623 --> 03:53:58.991
AND THE LACK OF ACTION IN

03:53:59.058 --> 03:54:00.393
CONGRESS TO EXTEND THE ENHANCED

AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. IT

03:54:03.295 --> 03:54:04.330
WILL DIRECTLY INCREASE

03:54:04.397 --> 03:54:06.599
HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR HARDWORKING

03:54:06.665 --> 03:54:07.566
CALIFORNIANS, DESTABILIZING

03:54:07.633 --> 03:54:09.368
DESTABILIZE THE MARKET, AND LEAD

03:54:09.435 --> 03:54:11.203
TO EVEN HIGHER INCREASES IN THE

03:54:11.270 --> 03:54:13.305
FUTURE. HOWEVER, CAP AND OUR

03:54:13.372 --> 03:54:14.874

03:54:14.940 --> 03:54:16.342

IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. GOOD

03:54:31.090 --> 03:54:32.425
EVENING, RITA MEDINA. I AM THE

03:54:32.491 --> 03:54:33.859
DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE LATINO

03:54:33.926 --> 03:54:34.994
COALITION FOR HEALTHY

03:54:35.060 --> 03:54:37.163
CALIFORNIA. LCHC, ECHOING

03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:38.264
EVERYBODY'S COMMENTS MULTIPLE

03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:39.298
TIMES. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS

03:54:39.365 --> 03:54:40.833
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. YOU

03:54:40.900 --> 03:54:43.569
KNOW, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

03:54:43.636 --> 03:54:45.171
LATINO HEALTH $N

03:54:45.237 --> 03:54:46.906
COMING OUT OF COVID AND THE

03:54:46.972 --> 03:54:49.108
CONTINUED IMPACTS ON LATINOS. WE

03:54:49.175 --> 03:54:50.409
TALKED ABOUT LATINO HEALTH WHEN

03:54:50.476 --> 03:54:52.545
WE WENT THROUGH REDETERMINATION

03:54:52.611 --> 03:54:55.114
WITH MEDI-CAL, NOT UNDER H.R.

03:54:55.181 --> 03:54:56.515
ONE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND KNEW HOW

03:54:56.582 --> 03:54:58.717
THAT REDETERMINATION PROCESS

03:54:58.784 --> 03:55:00.319
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED LATINOS

03:55:00.386 --> 03:55:02.054
BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS,

03:55:02.121 --> 03:55:03.489
CHANGING ADDRESSES, MAIL,

03:55:03.556 --> 03:55:04.557
ADMINISTRATIVE PIECES. AND NOW

03:55:04.623 --> 03:55:06.725
HERE WE ARE WITH H.R. ONE,

03:55:06.792 --> 03:55:08.127
FACING THESE NEGATIVE

03:55:08.194 --> 03:55:09.562
CONSEQUENCES. LAYERED ON TOP OF

03:55:09.628 --> 03:55:12.164
THAT ARE STATE BUDGET DECISIONS

03:55:12.231 --> 03:55:14.200
THAT WERE RECENTLY MADE TO LIMIT

03:55:14.266 --> 03:55:16.101
AND CUT ACCESS TO MEDI-CAL. AND

03:55:16.168 --> 03:55:18.471
SO WE KNOW THAT LATINO PUBLIC

03:55:18.537 --> 03:55:20.473
HEALTH IS ON THE LINE. I THINK,

03:55:20.539 --> 03:55:21.841
YOU KNOW, JUST POINTING TO ONE

03:55:21.907 --> 03:55:23.175
OTHER PIECE THAT COLLEAGUE

03:55:23.242 --> 03:55:25.744
MENTIONED AT THE TOP, ONE OF THE

03:55:25.811 --> 03:55:26.745
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE

03:55:26.812 --> 03:55:28.814
RIGHT NOW, AND LCHC WE'RE VERY

03:55:28.881 --> 03:55:31.150
MUCH FOCUSED ON, IS INVESTING IN

03:55:31.217 --> 03:55:32.218

03:55:34.053 --> 03:55:36.856
EVERY WEEK THAT THEY ARE ON THE

03:55:36.922 --> 03:55:38.791
FRONT LINES. WE KNOW THEY ARE

03:55:38.858 --> 03:55:39.391
THERE HEARING THESE QUESTIONS

03:55:39.458 --> 03:55:40.826
THAT WE HAVE ABOUT PEOPLE COMING

03:55:40.893 --> 03:55:42.561
AND SAYING, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE

03:55:42.628 --> 03:55:45.130
MY OPTIONS FOR ENROLLING IN

03:55:45.197 --> 03:55:48.133
MEDI-CAL? OKAY, BUT WHAT ARE MY

03:55:48.200 --> 03:55:49.168
ACTUAL REALITIES AS A PERSON? DO

03:55:49.235 --> 03:55:51.270
YOU HAVE LEGAL RESOURCES? AND SO

03:55:51.337 --> 03:55:52.738
THEY'RE HAVING TO PROVIDE HEALTH

03:55:52.805 --> 03:55:55.207
BENEFIT INFORMATION NOW, COUPLED

COUNSELOR AND PROVIDING LEGAL

03:55:58.511 --> 03:56:00.679
RECOURSE INFORMATION. AND SO WE

03:56:00.746 --> 03:56:02.648
HAVE BEEN WORKING TO FIGURE

03:56:02.715 --> 03:56:04.183
THOSE CONVERSATIONS OUT AND MOVE

03:56:04.250 --> 03:56:06.218
FORWARD. AND SO IF THERE IS AN

03:56:06.285 --> 03:56:07.219
OPPORTUNITY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

03:56:07.286 --> 03:56:08.220
THE WORD PROVIDERS, WE THINK

03:56:08.287 --> 03:56:09.622
ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PLACES WHERE

03:56:09.688 --> 03:56:11.123
PEOPLE GET THEIR CARE, BUT ALSO

03:56:11.190 --> 03:56:12.491
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING

03:56:12.558 --> 03:56:14.026
THEIR CARE. AND THEN JUST TO

03:56:14.093 --> 03:56:15.327
FINALLY CLOSE AND SAY AGAIN,

03:56:15.394 --> 03:56:16.795
THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

03:56:16.862 --> 03:56:18.464
WE KNOW THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS

03:56:18.531 --> 03:56:20.165
COUPLED TOGETHER ARE GOING TO

03:56:20.232 --> 03:56:21.534
PUT US IN LATINO PUBLIC HEALTH

03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:22.968
FURTHER BEHIND. AND SO WE

03:56:23.035 --> 03:56:24.203
ENCOURAGE, AS WE MOVE FORWARD

03:56:24.270 --> 03:56:25.938
THIS YEAR, TO REALLY HOLD THE

03:56:26.005 --> 03:56:27.773
LINE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON

03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:28.741
BASELINE SAFETY NET PROTECTIONS

03:56:28.807 --> 03:56:31.277
THAT WE STILL HAVE, SO THAT THE

03:56:31.343 --> 03:56:33.445
RECOVERY FROM THIS TRUMP ERA

03:56:33.512 --> 03:56:35.447
DOES NOT PUT US FURTHER BACK.

03:56:35.514 --> 03:56:38.117
THANK YOU. THANKS, RITA. THANK

03:56:38.183 --> 03:56:39.952

MEDI-CAL DENTAL PROVIDER, AND

03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:46.392
HAVE BEEN PART OF MEDI-CAL SINCE

03:56:46.458 --> 03:56:48.961
THE BEGINNING. I AGAIN WANT TO

03:56:49.028 --> 03:56:50.729
ECHO THE THANKS OF MY

03:56:50.796 --> 03:56:51.263

03:56:52.197 --> 03:56:54.433
TO STAFF FOR ALL YOUR WORK OVER

03:56:54.500 --> 03:56:56.368
THE LAST DECADE. THROUGH STRONG

03:56:56.435 --> 03:56:57.002
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AND

03:56:57.069 --> 03:56:58.470
FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, WE HAVE

03:56:58.537 --> 03:56:59.071
MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS TO

03:56:59.138 --> 03:57:00.573
INCREASE ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH

03:57:00.639 --> 03:57:02.341
CARE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THAT

03:57:02.408 --> 03:57:04.209
PROGRESS IS NOW AT RISK UNDER

03:57:04.276 --> 03:57:06.178
H.R. ONE, THE LIMITS ON PROVIDER

03:57:06.245 --> 03:57:07.613
TAXES JEOPARDIZE CALIFORNIA'S

03:57:07.680 --> 03:57:09.481
ABILITY TO SUSTAIN MEDI-CAL

03:57:09.548 --> 03:57:11.216
FUNDING. THE REDUCTION IN THE

03:57:11.283 --> 03:57:12.685
FEDERAL MATCH FOR IMMIGRANT

03:57:12.751 --> 03:57:14.553
POPULATIONS WILL SHIFT COSTS TO

03:57:14.620 --> 03:57:16.221
PROVIDERS, AND WE ARE FULLY

03:57:16.288 --> 03:57:17.756
SUPPORTIVE OF TREATING ALL

03:57:17.823 --> 03:57:18.857
PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF THE

03:57:18.924 --> 03:57:21.093
ABILITY TO PAY. BUT H.R. ONE

03:57:21.160 --> 03:57:22.761
DEFINITELY SETS US BACK A

03:57:22.828 --> 03:57:24.263
SEPARATE FROM H.R. ONE. WE WANT

03:57:24.330 --> 03:57:26.765
TO NOTE THAT WE ARE SEEING A

03:57:26.832 --> 03:57:27.833
CHILLING, CHILLING EFFECT OF

03:57:27.900 --> 03:57:29.168
INCREASED FEDERAL IMMIGRATION

03:57:29.234 --> 03:57:31.036
ENFORCEMENT. IN OUR SOUTHERN

03:57:31.103 --> 03:57:32.104
CALIFORNIA CLINICS, UTILIZATION

03:57:32.171 --> 03:57:34.206
HAS DECREASED BY ROUGHLY 20% AS

03:57:34.273 --> 03:57:36.075
FAMILIES AVOID VISITS DUE TO

03:57:36.141 --> 03:57:38.611
FEAR AS CHILDREN RETURN TO

03:57:38.677 --> 03:57:39.612
SCHOOL. THIS MEANS MORE KIDS

03:57:39.678 --> 03:57:41.180
WITHOUT PREVENTIVE CARE, WHICH

03:57:41.246 --> 03:57:42.881
NOT ONLY HARMS THEIR HEALTH BUT

03:57:42.948 --> 03:57:44.316
AFFECTS THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN.

03:57:44.383 --> 03:57:46.485
SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF THE

03:57:46.552 --> 03:57:47.620
CHALLENGES STEM FROM FEDERAL

03:57:47.686 --> 03:57:49.388
ACTIONS BEYOND YOUR CONTROL.

03:57:49.455 --> 03:57:50.889
HOWEVER, WE URGE YOU TO THINK

03:57:50.956 --> 03:57:52.057
CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA

03:57:52.124 --> 03:57:54.426
CAN RESPOND AND TO DRAW FROM

03:57:54.493 --> 03:57:55.894
EXPERTISE OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN

03:57:55.961 --> 03:57:57.963

ACCESS TO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES,

03:58:01.500 --> 03:58:02.468
AND PRESERVING THE STATE'S

03:58:02.534 --> 03:58:05.204
ABILITY TO INNOVATE AND CARE

H.R. ONE ON CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET

03:58:17.616 --> 03:58:19.284
AND OUR HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET.

03:58:19.351 --> 03:58:20.953
THIS IS A CRITICAL CONVERSATION

03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:22.121
FOR THE PATIENTS AND COMMUNITIES

03:58:22.187 --> 03:58:23.956
WE SERVE. AT ULTIMATE, WE

VAST MAJORITY ENROLLED IN

03:58:28.327 --> 03:58:30.162
MEDI-CAL EVERY DAY. WE LIVE OUR

COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE

03:58:37.403 --> 03:58:39.438
CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. FEDERAL

03:58:39.505 --> 03:58:40.906
PROPOSALS LIKE H.R. ONE THAT

03:58:40.973 --> 03:58:42.708
RESTRICT STATE FLEXIBILITY OR

03:58:42.775 --> 03:58:43.776
REDUCE HEALTHCARE FUNDING

03:58:43.842 --> 03:58:44.910
STREAMS THREATENED TO

03:58:44.977 --> 03:58:46.645
DESTABILIZE MEDI-CAL. ANY

03:58:46.712 --> 03:58:47.780
FUNDING DISRUPTIONS WOULD

03:58:47.846 --> 03:58:49.248
DIRECTLY REDUCE PATIENT ACCESS

03:58:49.314 --> 03:58:51.016
AND STRAIN SAFETY. NET PROVIDERS

03:58:51.083 --> 03:58:52.351

SHORTAGES AND RISING COSTS,

03:58:54.553 --> 03:58:55.387
CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED HARD TO

03:58:55.454 --> 03:58:57.089
BUILD SUSTAINABLE FINANCING

03:58:57.156 --> 03:58:58.524

03:59:01.794 --> 03:59:03.529
DOLLARS ARE USED FOR THEIR

03:59:03.595 --> 03:59:05.664
INTENDED PURPOSE. BUT IF FEDERAL

03:59:05.731 --> 03:59:07.466
ACTIONS ERODE STATE OPTIONS, THE

03:59:07.533 --> 03:59:08.600
CONSEQUENCES WILL RIPPLE ACROSS

03:59:08.667 --> 03:59:11.537
THE SYSTEM, JEOPARDIZING ACCESS,

03:59:11.603 --> 03:59:12.705

CALIFORNIA. AND WE JUST WANT TO

04:06:46.458 --> 04:06:48.527
ELEVATE THREE POINTS. ONE, THAT

THE CURRENT THE CURRENT MEDICAID

ONE COULD FACE COULD MEAN THAT

04:06:55.233 --> 04:06:55.934
THE COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS

04:06:56.001 --> 04:06:57.235
WON'T BE ABLE TO ABSORB THOSE

04:06:57.302 --> 04:06:59.671
KINDS OF HITS AND THEREFORE WILL

04:06:59.738 --> 04:07:01.473
HAVE TO WILL LEAD TO REDUCTIONS

04:07:01.540 --> 04:07:03.408
OR CLOSURES OF SOME OF THEIR

04:07:03.475 --> 04:07:05.577
FACILITIES FOR SOME OF THE FOLKS

04:07:05.644 --> 04:07:06.444
THAT THEY SERVE. SECOND, BECAUSE

04:07:06.511 --> 04:07:07.913
OF THE CURRENT IMMIGRATION

THAT THEY'RE HAVING ON OUR LOCAL

04:07:12.784 --> 04:07:14.519
COMMUNITIES MEANS THAT A LOT OF

04:07:14.586 --> 04:07:15.487
FOLKS THAT NEED SOME OF THOSE

04:07:15.554 --> 04:07:17.355
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR

04:07:17.422 --> 04:07:18.690
SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES ARE NOT

ABOUT THAT HAPPENING IN OUR

04:07:27.933 --> 04:07:30.635

SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SEEING

04:07:34.039 --> 04:07:35.674
COULD POSE A HUGE CHALLENGE AND

04:07:35.740 --> 04:07:37.542
RISK TO A LOT OF THE PROVIDERS

04:07:37.609 --> 04:07:39.044
BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE

04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:40.478
PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVE IN THEIR

04:07:40.545 --> 04:07:41.880

04:07:41.947 --> 04:07:44.149
LOT OF THEM ARE NOT GOING TO BE

04:07:44.216 --> 04:07:45.784
ABLE TO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES

04:07:45.850 --> 04:07:46.418
OR CONTINUE THOSE SERVICES, AND

04:07:46.484 --> 04:07:48.220
ONCE AGAIN LEAD TO A FURTHER

04:07:48.286 --> 04:07:50.021
ISSUE AND CREATE A WIDER AND

04:07:50.088 --> 04:07:51.957
WIDER GAP THAT WE JUST WON'T BE

04:07:52.023 --> 04:07:53.325
ABLE TO CLOSE IN MORE AND MORE

04:07:53.391 --> 04:07:54.859
RECENT YEARS. SO WE'RE HOPING

04:07:54.926 --> 04:07:56.561
THAT SOME OF THOSE, SOME OF

04:07:56.628 --> 04:07:58.096
THOSE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE

04:07:58.163 --> 04:07:59.531

THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND SEE IF

04:08:05.103 --> 04:08:06.738
THERE'S ANY WAYS OR ANY

04:08:06.805 --> 04:08:07.339
OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH WE CAN

04:08:07.405 --> 04:08:10.308
WORK TOGETHER TO KIND OF FIND A

04:08:10.375 --> 04:08:10.909
