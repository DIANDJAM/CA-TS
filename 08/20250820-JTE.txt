HERE TODAY TO SHARE THEIR

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.789
EXPERIENCES, AND PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:03.956
WATCHING ONLINE, AND OUR

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.158
PARTNERS WHO AREN'T ABLE TO

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.727
WATCH TODAY BECAUSE WE ARE

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.762
FACING SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:10.763
ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES IN

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.500
HISTORY. AND IT'S ONLY TOGETHER,

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:15.835
WORKING COLLABORATIVELY, THAT

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:18.671
WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:22.041
LEAVE THIS PLACE BETTER THAN WE

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.843
FOUND IT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.947
SO THAT'S MY OVERARCHING

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:30.850
PHILOSOPHY ABOUT HOW I LEAD THE

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.686
ORGANIZATION. WITH THAT SAID,

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.822
SINCE I'VE STARTED SERVING AS

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:38.758
DIRECTOR JUST NINE MONTHS AGO,

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.727
I'VE BROUGHT THREE PILLARS TO

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:45.765
GUIDE OUR DEPARTMENT FIRST,

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:46.899
ENFORCEMENT STRENGTH,

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.901
STRENGTHENING OUR ENFORCEMENT

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.671
CULTURE AT THE DEPARTMENT TO

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:53.339
IMPROVING OUR COMMUNITY

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:56.809
ENGAGEMENT, AND THREE, WORKING

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:57.977
COLLABORATIVELY, NOT JUST

00:07:58.044 --> 00:08:00.012
ACROSS THE SILOS WITHIN OUR OWN

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.814
DEPARTMENT, BUT ACROSS SILOS

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:04.650
WITH OUR REGULATORY PARTNERS,

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:07.854
OUR OTHER EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.390
AND I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:13.092
OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITHIN

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.861
THESE THREE PILLARS OVER THE

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:18.664
PAST YEAR, BECAUSE THESE

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:22.969
PILLARS HAVE REALLY HELPED US

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.371
MOVE FORWARD PAST REFORM. THAT

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.406
WAS ONLY FOUR YEARS AGO TO

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:29.876
BECOME A MORE TRANSPARENT,

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:31.711
ACCOUNTABLE AND PROACTIVE

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:35.248
DEPARTMENT. SO WE FOUND THAT

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:36.983
CONSISTENT, TIMELY AND

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.885
EQUITABLE ENFORCEMENT IS

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.354
INTEGRAL TO IMPLEMENTING OUR

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.355
STATUTORY MANDATES AND

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:44.223
PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES THAT

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.759
WE SERVE. FIRST AND FOREMOST,

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.127
OUR GOAL WITH ENFORCEMENT IS

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.662
ALWAYS TO BRING A REGULATORY,

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.864
REGULATED ENTITY INTO

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.065
COMPLIANCE. AND FOR THE MOST

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:56.235
PART, REGULATORY ENTITIES ARE

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.703
WILLING TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.272
SOMETIMES THEY NEED MORE

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:02.241
INFORMATION ON HOW TO DO THAT.

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:04.076
AND WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:04.744
CONSISTENT TRAINING FOR

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.013
ENFORCEMENT STAFF TO PROVIDE

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:08.714
INFORMATION TO REGULATORY,

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:11.484
REGULATED ENTITIES TO IMPROVE

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.685
COMPLIANCE THROUGH THOSE

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:15.221
INSPECTIONS IN THE FIELD. WE

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:17.790
ALSO ARE UNIQUE IN THE EPA

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.058
FAMILY, IN WHICH WE HAVE THE

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.761
ONLY SWORN PEACE OFFICERS, AND

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.195
WE HAVE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.665
TOOLS AS WELL, AND WE RESERVE

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:28.000
THOSE FOR THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.703
ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES. AND WE

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.238
WON'T HESITATE TO USE THAT

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.973
AUTHORITY WHEN NECESSARY. AND

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.875
THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT.

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:38.444
IN JUST THE PAST YEAR WHERE

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.879
WE'VE COLLABORATED MORE CLOSELY

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:42.949
WITH LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS,

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:44.183
PARTICULARLY THE LOS ANGELES

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.818
DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS BEEN A

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.620
LEADER IN THIS SPACE. WE

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:51.157
ASSISTED THE LA DA WITH AN

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:53.025
INVESTIGATION OF ATLAS METALS,

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.961
AND OUR WORK LED TO THE

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.663
SHUTDOWN OF ATLAS METALS,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.798
LOCATED IMMEDIATELY NEXT TO A

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:01.634
HIGH SCHOOL. IN RECENT YEARS,

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.070
THE FACILITY REPEATEDLY

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:05.771
RECEIVED VIOLATIONS. THE

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:07.907
COMMUNITY WAS VERY OUTSPOKEN

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:10.109
ABOUT THE FEAR THEIR KIDS HAD

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:12.378
GOING TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY,

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.879
RIGHT NEXT TO THIS FACILITY.

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:15.781
THE FACILITY HAD EXPLOSIONS OF

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:20.686
GAS CYLINDERS AND POSING HARM

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:22.154
FROM THE METALS BEING RECYCLED

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:24.623
THERE TO THE NEARBY HIGH SCHOOL.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.927
SO OUR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:28.761
TEAM WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE LA

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:32.064
DA, AND ULTIMATELY ATLAS WAS

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.000
CHARGED WITH FIVE FELONY COUNTS

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:34.800
OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:37.136
AND NOW THE FACILITY IS WORKING

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:38.938
TO COMPLY WITH OUR DEPARTMENT'S

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.707
CLEANUP ORDERS SO THAT THE SITE

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:45.945
CAN BE REVITALIZED, REUSED FOR,

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:48.347
HOPEFULLY, A COMMUNITY LED

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:50.649
PURPOSE. WE'VE ALSO TAKEN OUR

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:51.784
ENFORCEMENT SERIOUSLY WHEN IT

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.853
COMES TO CHIQUITA CANYON

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:56.722
LANDFILL, AND RECENTLY TOOK

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.958
ENFORCEMENT ACTION TO ADDRESS

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.626
THE ONGOING ELEVATED

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:02.428
TEMPERATURE CHEMICAL REACTION

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.530
THAT'S OCCURRING AT THAT

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:07.166
LANDFILL. IT'S IMPACTING THE

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:08.601
NEARBY COMMUNITIES. THE

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:09.902
COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:13.305
HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND ODORS. AND

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:16.175
IN APRIL THIS YEAR, WE ISSUED

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:16.876
AN IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:18.677
ENDANGERMENT ORDER AND A

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.046
SUMMARY OF VIOLATIONS TO

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.714
REQUIRE SEVERAL CORRECTIVE

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.784
ACTIONS, INCLUDING LAYING A GEO

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.087
MEMBRANE LAYER OVER OVER THE

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:28.954
LANDFILL TO CONTROL THE GASES

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.624
AND ODORS. IF THE LANDFILL

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.059
DOESN'T TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.528
MEASURES, IT WILL FACE

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:38.364
PENALTIES UP TO $70,000 PER DAY.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.465
ALSO DEMONSTRATING OUR

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.400
COMMITMENT TO ENFORCEMENT AND

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:44.937
TRANSPARENCY. LAST YEAR WE WE

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:46.872
UNVEILED ONLINE AN INTERACTIVE

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:49.608
MAP THAT SHOWS WHERE OUR

00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:51.010
INSPECTIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:53.079
ACROSS THE STATE. IN CALIFORNIA,

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.714
WE HEARD FEEDBACK ABOUT ENVIRO

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.616
STORE, OUR ONLINE DATABASE

00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:58.184
ABOUT THIS INFORMATION BEING

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.353
HARD TO ACCESS. VERY CUMBERSOME.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.489
AND WHILE WE HAVE CHALLENGES

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.157
FIXING AND VIRAL ENVIRO STORE

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:07.793
ITSELF, WE DECIDED WE WOULD

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.995
LAUNCH THIS MAP SO THAT PEOPLE

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:12.598
HAD EASY, EASY TO USE, READILY

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:13.866
AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:16.268
WHERE DTSC IS CONDUCTING ITS

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.803
ACTIVITIES, AND THEN THEY CAN

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.472
EASILY LINK TO THE SUMMARIES OF

00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:21.173
THOSE INSPECTIONS VIOLATIONS

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.343
AND BE MORE AWARE OF WHAT'S

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.177
HAPPENING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:28.080
SO YOU WILL SEE US DOING MORE

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:29.115
COMMUNICATION ABOUT OUR

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:30.316
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. IT'S

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:31.784
IMPORTANT FOR THE REGULATED

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.119
ENTITIES SO THEY UNDERSTAND THE

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:34.820
LAWS TO COMPLY WITH, AND THEN

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:37.089
ALSO FOR THE COMMUNITIES WHO

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.090
ARE LOCATED NEAR THESE

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:39.859
FACILITIES SO THEY UNDERSTAND

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.727
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:43.662
NEIGHBORHOOD AND GIVING

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:44.930
EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES WITH

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:47.633
INFORMATION ON HOW TO REPORT

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.468
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS TO US AS

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:52.738
WELL. SECOND, STRENGTHENING

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:53.706
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.975
COLLABORATION. THIS IS A HUGE

00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:57.710
PRIORITY FOR US THIS YEAR,

00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:00.212
ESPECIALLY AS ICE RAIDS AND

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.014
MILITARY PRESENCE IN

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:04.150
COMMUNITIES ARE THREATENING THE

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.918
COMMUNITIES WE SERVE AND THEIR

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:09.188
HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND ECONOMIC

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:12.224
STABILITY. AND SO WE TAKE OUR

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.592
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EXTREMELY

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.728
SERIOUSLY, PROBABLY NOW MORE

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:18.531
THAN EVER, TO DO IT IN A

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:20.199
THOUGHTFUL WAY AS A GOVERNMENT

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.235
ENTITY, DOING PUBLIC OUTREACH

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.304
IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:26.872
OVERBURDENED WITH POLLUTION, WE

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:29.041
HAVE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:31.010
COMMUNITY LEADERS. WE HAVE TO

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:33.646
BE SENSITIVE TO ACCESS TO

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:36.115
MEETING SPACES AND INFORMATION,

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.284
AND OUR TEAMS ARE DOING A GREAT

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.319
JOB OF TAKING ALL OF THAT INTO

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:43.889
ACCOUNT. AN EXAMPLE OF DTSC

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.591
DOING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.760
DIFFERENTLY THAN THE PAST IS.

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:49.962
TONIGHT WILL BE HOLDING A

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:53.165
SECOND OPEN HOUSE IN

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:55.034
BUTTONWILLOW, WHERE ONE OF OUR

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.901
HAZARDOUS WASTE LANDFILL

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:57.903
FACILITIES IS LOCATED, AND

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.272
WE'RE BRINGING ENVIRONMENTAL

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.341
REGULATORS FROM ACROSS THE

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.677
STATE TO ONE SPACE. SO IT'S A

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:06.845
ONE STOP SHOP FOR THE COMMUNITY

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:09.215
TO GET INFORMATION ON

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.349
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS THEY MAY

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:11.884
BE EXPERIENCING. SO WHILE DTSC

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:15.354
IS FOCUSED ON THE PERMIT

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:17.156
RENEWAL PROCESS FOR

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:19.325
BUTTONWILLOW LANDFILL, WE'RE

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.826
USING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:22.228
ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY ABOUT

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.662
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS THEY MAY

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:26.165
BE HAVING AND BRINGING

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.700
INFORMATION SOLUTIONS, TALKING

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:28.867
THROUGH THEIR PROBLEMS WITH

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:32.738
THEM IN REAL TIME AND IN

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:33.839
SPANISH, SINCE IT'S LARGELY A

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:36.342
SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITY.

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:38.811
WE'VE MADE STRIDES IN OTHER

00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:40.713
AREAS, SETTING UP OUR OWN

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:43.115
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.684
COUNCIL THAT WAS A PART OF THE

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:48.988
REFORM MANDATE. THIS COUNCIL

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.789
WAS LAUNCHED AND HELD THEIR

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:51.890
FIRST MEETING THIS YEAR, WHICH

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:55.427
WAS A BIG MILESTONE FOR US.

00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:57.596
WE'VE HELD OVER A DOZEN

00:14:57.663 --> 00:14:58.864
WORKSHOPS AND FOUR PUBLIC

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:00.766
HEARINGS WITH THE BOARD'S

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.134
PARTNERSHIP AND LEADERSHIP ON

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.403
THE PUBLIC HEARINGS FOR THE

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.238
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:09.074
FOR THE EXIDE CLEANUP PROJECT,

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.043
ONE OF DTS'S LEGACY CLEANUPS.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.978
WE DEVELOPED NEW APPROACHES TO

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:14.980
CONDUCT OUTREACH AND COLLECT

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:16.782
FEEDBACK. WE HAVE AN EXIDE

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:18.817
CLEANUP FEEDBACK MANAGEMENT

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:20.653
SYSTEM, SO THIS IS AN ONLINE

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:21.920
PORTAL THAT MAKES IT A LOT

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:24.056
EASIER FOR THE PUBLIC TO SUBMIT

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:25.624
THEIR COMMENTS, ASK THEIR

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:28.027
QUESTIONS, TRACK OUR RESPONSES

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.663
AND FEEDBACK. NOT QUITE REAL

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.865
TIME, BUT CLOSE TO IT. AND

00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:33.766
THAT'S A MODEL. NOW WE'RE

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:36.135
LOOKING TO TAKE TO OTHER

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.870
PROJECTS WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF

00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:39.805
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, AND SO WE

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:41.940
STILL HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:43.676
TAKE THESE EXAMPLES AND

00:15:43.742 --> 00:15:44.977
INSTITUTIONALIZE THEM MORE

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.512
ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT. BUT WE

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:50.883
ARE ON OUR WAY TO DO THAT. A

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.718
TOOL TO DO THAT GOING FORWARD.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.888
LOOKING AHEAD THIS YEAR, ONE OF

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:57.690
MY PRIORITIES IS TO OVERHAUL

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:00.459
OUR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION MANUAL,

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:02.728
WHICH WHEN IT WAS CREATED FIRST

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.431
WAS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE FIRST

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:07.833
OF ITS KIND AND WAS

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.001
REVOLUTIONARY. AND SO WE WANT

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.803
TO DUST IT OFF. WE WANT TO MAKE

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:13.072
SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:15.341
PARTICIPATION PRACTICES ARE

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:17.276
MODERNIZED, REFLECTING THE BEST

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.611
STANDARDS TODAY. SO WE'LL BE

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.313
WORKING ON THAT OVER THE COURSE

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.916
OF THE NEXT YEAR. AND INVOLVING

00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:25.718
STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND COMMENT

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:30.856
TO THAT PROCESS. AS FAR AS

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:32.257
COLLABORATION GOES, WE HAVE

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:35.060
BEEN PARTICIPATING IN DOZENS OF

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.061
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TASK

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:38.731
FORCE MEETINGS ACROSS THE STATE.

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:41.033
THIS IS WHERE LOCAL ENTITIES

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.769
AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS BRING

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.537
ISSUES TO OUR INVESTIGATORS,

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.940
OUR ENFORCEMENT TEAMS. AND, YOU

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:50.576
KNOW, WE FOLLOW UP ON

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:51.910
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS,

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:54.246
WORKING TOGETHER CLOSELY WITH

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:55.848
OUR AGENCY PARTNERS AT CARB, AT

00:16:55.914 --> 00:17:00.619
THE WATER BOARD, SOMETIMES DPR

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:03.889
AND OTHERS. IT'S REALLY THE

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.225
CROSS COORDINATION ON OUR

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.261
REGULATORY RESPONSES THAT OFTEN

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:11.363
MAKES US MOST SUCCESSFUL WHEN

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.699
WE'RE TACKLING SOME OF THE

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.300
HARDEST OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:18.570
PROBLEMS, SO THAT COLLABORATION

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:20.839
IS KEY. EARLIER THIS YEAR, AS

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:22.374
YOU ALL KNOW, THE EATON AND

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:23.809
PALISADES FIRES DEVASTATED THE

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.978
RESIDENTS OF LOS ANGELES. AND

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.147
SO WE WERE ALL HANDS ON DECK

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:29.815
WITH THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.550
REMOVAL FROM THE PROPERTIES IN

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:34.853
A RECORD TIME OF 30 DAYS,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.622
WORKING CLOSELY WITH US, EPA,

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:40.325
WE WERE INTEGRATED INTO THE US

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.261
EPA RESPONSE TEAMS, WORKING

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.929
TOGETHER TO REMOVE ALL THE

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.597
HAZARDOUS WASTE FROM THE

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:46.865
PROPERTIES. NOW, U.S. ARMY

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:49.701
CORPS OF ENGINEERS HAS CLOSE TO

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:51.170
FINISHED THE PHASE TWO

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.672
OPERATIONS, AND WE CONTINUE TO

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:54.940
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:57.242
OUR TOXICOLOGY EXPERTS ARE

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:59.178
RESPONDING IN REAL TIME TO

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:01.547
QUESTIONS FROM CONSULTANTS. THE

00:18:01.613 --> 00:18:04.817
COUNTY ON REBUILD PROCESS, AND

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:07.085
HELPING RESIDENTS HAVE A CLEAR

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.188
PATH TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:13.125
LIVES. SO I'D LIKE TO PIVOT

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:15.928
FROM THOSE THREE PILLARS. THE

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:17.763
OVERARCHING SORT OF STRATEGIC

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.999
GOALS OF OUR DEPARTMENT. NOW TO

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.868
REFORM SPECIFICS AND FOUR MAJOR

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.903
AREAS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.305
REFLECT HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS

00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:27.906
BEEN IMPLEMENTING THE REFORM

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:31.910
MANDATES. FIRST FEES, ALONG

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:35.547
WITH GOVERNANCE REFORM, OFFERED

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:39.117
FEE REFORM. AND SO I'M HAPPY TO

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:40.853
SHARE THAT DTSC IS NOW A

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:44.056
FISCALLY STABLE AGENCY. THIS IS

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:47.960
A TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT FROM

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:51.163
REFORM EFFORTS. REFORM

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.964
ESTABLISHED A SUSTAINABLE FEE

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.400
STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR CORE

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.202
PROGRAMS AND ADDRESS THESE

00:18:57.269 --> 00:19:00.572
HISTORICAL FISCAL CHALLENGES.

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:01.807
HOWEVER, SINCE THE ENACTMENT

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:05.644
FOUR YEARS AGO, WE DID

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:08.413
INITIALLY, WE DID INITIALLY

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.915
EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES. AND SO

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.885
WE WERE BRINGING IN LESS FEES

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:15.821
THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. AND SO

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:19.291
I'M GRATEFUL TO OUR STAFF, OUR

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:22.828
BUDGET OFFICE, LEGISLATORS FOR

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:26.031
THEIR SUPPORT IN HELPING US

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.466
ADDRESS THE SHORTFALL. WE

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.801
QUICKLY MOVED TO PARTNER WITH

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:32.704
THE LEGISLATURE, MAKE NECESSARY

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:35.107
STATUTORY CHANGES AROUND

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:36.909
PARTICULARLY EXEMPTIONS AND

00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:39.811
PENALTIES FOR LATE OR

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:41.980
NONPAYMENT. AND THEN WE

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:44.049
PROMULGATED REGULATIONS TO

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:44.850
IMPLEMENT THESE STATUTORY

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:47.719
CHANGES. AND THESE REGULATIONS

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:49.221
WENT INTO EFFECT EARLIER THIS

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:52.291
YEAR. SO LIKE WITH ANY NEW

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:54.726
SYSTEM, SORT OF THE DUST NEEDS

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.595
TO SETTLE, YOU KNOW, SEE HOW

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.831
THE FEES ARE COMING IN, WHAT

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:01.099
ASPECTS OF THAT SYSTEM NEED TO

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:02.734
BE TWEAKED. AND THAT'S EXACTLY

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:04.870
WHAT WE DID WITH THESE RECENT

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:07.739
STATUTORY CHANGES AND THE

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:09.107
REGULATIONS THAT WE SET FORTH

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:10.976
EARLIER THIS YEAR. SO THOSE

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.946
WERE SUCCESSFUL. AND LIKE I

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:15.948
MENTIONED, NOW WE'RE FISCALLY

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:18.550
STABLE WITH THOSE CHANGES.

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:20.686
SECOND, THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:22.921
MANAGEMENT PLAN, AS YOU

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:24.623
MENTIONED, SENATOR BLAKE SPEER

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.960
IS A PLAN THAT REQUIRES OUR

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:30.862
DEPARTMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.598
FUTURE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:36.201
MANAGEMENT IN OUR STATE AND

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:37.269
WHAT STRATEGIES,

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:39.771
RECOMMENDATIONS DO WE HAVE FOR

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:41.773
PARTICULARLY WASTE REDUCTION

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.810
AND WASTE DIVERSION. AND THAT

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:47.279
IS OUR NUMBER ONE FOCUS WITH

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:51.216
THIS PLAN. HOW CAN WE AS A

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:52.784
DEPARTMENT, FOSTER MORE

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.319
SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.088
PRACTICES AND INVEST IN

00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:58.824
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AND

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.025
FACILITATE THAT RESEARCH AND

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.793
INNOVATION ACROSS THE STATE? SO

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.863
IT'S NOT JUST A GUIDE FOR OUR

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.832
DEPARTMENT'S ACTIVITIES, BUT

00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:10.335
IT'S A GUIDE FOR STATEWIDE

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.504
ACTIVITIES, LOCAL ACTIVITIES

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:16.108
ALIKE, AND TO FACILITATE OUR

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:17.709
PARTNERSHIPS. EARLIER THIS YEAR

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.012
IN MARCH, WE RELEASED AND WE

00:21:20.078 --> 00:21:22.314
MET THE STATUTORY DEADLINE FOR

00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:23.882
THE RELEASE OF THE FIRST DRAFT

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.984
OF THE PLAN AND SUBMITTED IT TO

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:28.120
THE BOARD. THE BOARD HAS HELD

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:29.788
FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS, AND WE

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:33.792
HEARD EXTENSIVE PUBLIC COMMENT.

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.627
WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:39.197
THE PUBLIC AND FROM THE BOARD,

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:40.599
PARTICULARLY ONE ASPECT OF THE

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:44.036
PLAN WE HAD SET FORTH WHERE WE

00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:46.772
PROPOSED TO DIVERT NON METAL

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:48.874
CONTAMINATED SOIL TO MUNICIPAL

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.910
LANDFILLS, THAT WE WE WERE

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.079
ASKED TO TAKE THAT OUT. SO WE

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.348
DID. SO WE'VE BEEN REVISING THE

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:58.684
PLAN ACCORDING TO THE THE

00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.951
PUBLIC COMMENT AND THE BOARD

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:02.287
INPUT THAT WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING,

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:03.789
OUR STAFF AND THE BOARD STAFF

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:05.090
HAVE BEEN WORKING INTENSELY

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.359
TOGETHER OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:08.694
MONTHS TO PRODUCE A REVISED

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.996
PLAN THAT WILL BE RELEASING

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:13.965
LATER THIS YEAR. SO OUR GOAL IS

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:18.770
TO GET A FINAL PLAN CODIFIED,

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.639
APPROVED BY THE BOARD BY THE

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:23.141
END OF THE YEAR. AND I'M

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.142
CONFIDENT THAT THE

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.077
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PLAN

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:28.180
WILL SET US ON THE RIGHT PATH

00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:30.716
TO THINK MORE PROACTIVELY ABOUT

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:32.951
WASTE REDUCTION. WASTE

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:33.752
DIVERSION. WE STILL DO HAVE

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.787
SOME DATA GAPS THAT MAKE THIS

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:37.923
CHALLENGING FOR US TO SET

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:40.826
SPECIFIC GOALS. SO WE ARE IN

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:43.095
THIS THREE YEAR CYCLE OF

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:44.763
UPDATING THE PLAN EVERY THREE

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.998
YEARS. AND AS WE GET MORE

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:49.801
MODERNIZED DATA SYSTEMS, BETTER

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:50.969
INFORMATION ON DIFFERENT WASTE

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:55.407
STREAMS, THEN WE WILL BE MOVING

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:56.608
FORWARD TO REFINING THE PLAN IN

00:22:56.675 --> 00:22:59.845
FUTURE YEARS AS WELL. THIRD, I

00:22:59.911 --> 00:23:02.047
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR EQUITABLE

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:03.148
COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION GRANT

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:05.484
PROGRAM. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.886
POPULAR GRANT PROGRAM THAT

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:10.989
FUNDS ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUPS.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:14.993
AND SO IT SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.828
PROPERTIES THAT ARE BEING

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:19.664
REVITALIZED BY LOCAL

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:22.467
MUNICIPALITY, NONPROFIT

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:25.003
ORGANIZATION. AND WE ALLOCATED

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.006
OVER $129 MILLION THROUGH 90

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:30.909
GRANTS TO SUPPORT CLEANUP OF

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:33.378
CONTAMINATED SITES FOR NEW USES.

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:36.214
THE USES INCLUDE AFFORDABLE

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.415
HOUSING, COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:40.252
SPACES, PARKS AND COMMUNITY

00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:42.654
GARDENS. SO MORE THAN HALF OF

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.256
THESE PROJECTS FUNDED BY THE

00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:45.557
GRANT PROGRAM ARE IN

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:46.658
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:49.094
COMMUNITIES, AND THEY'VE MADE

00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:51.730
MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS TO

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.165
AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:53.932
DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED IN

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:56.835
THE PAST. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE

00:23:56.902 --> 00:23:58.003
MISS MARGARET GORDON WESTPORT

00:23:58.069 --> 00:24:00.705
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT, AND

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:03.141
THIS PROVIDES 58 AFFORDABLE

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:05.043
HOUSING UNITS IN WEST OAKLAND,

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.913
FUNDED IN PART THROUGH THIS

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:11.249
GRANT PROGRAM. ANOTHER EXAMPLE

00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:11.983
IS THE REVITALIZATION OF THE

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.753
WEST ANAHEIM CORRIDOR THROUGH

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.888
THE CITY OF ANAHEIM'S REBUILD

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:18.790
BEACH INITIATIVE, AND THEY

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:20.392
RECENTLY HOSTED A

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:21.893
GROUNDBREAKING CONSTRUCTION OF

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.863
NEARLY 50 EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:29.067
HOUSING UNITS. SO THROUGH THIS

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.036
WORK IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:34.039
DEVELOPMENT, WE'VE RECOGNIZED

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:37.275
THAT BECAUSE OF SILOS THAT

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:39.044
NATURALLY EXIST, PIECEMEAL

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.148
APPROACH IN FUNDING CAN CREATE

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:45.016
DELAYS. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:48.353
TAKING ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.155
BY COORDINATING ACROSS STATE

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:51.957
DEPARTMENTS, SUCH AS WITH THE

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:53.491
CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT

00:24:53.558 --> 00:24:54.826
ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND THE

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.027
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:57.796
HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

00:24:57.863 --> 00:25:00.065
DEVELOPMENT. SO WE ALIGN OUR

00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:02.133
FUNDING TIMELINES, AND THEN

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.969
ULTIMATELY THAT MAKES FOR MORE

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:06.204
EFFICIENT PROJECT TIMELINES.

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:07.572
WE'RE ALSO DOING OUTREACH TO

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:10.442
LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES ABOUT HOW

00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:12.677
TO WORK THE PROCESS OF

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:14.312
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP TO

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:16.982
SUPPORT MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:20.285
DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER COMMUNITY

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.420
REUSE PROJECTS, SUPPORTIVE

00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:27.192
HOUSING, PARKS, ETC. FOURTH,

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:31.429
THE BACKLOG OF PERMITS I KNOW

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.098
IS ALWAYS A TOPIC WHEN YOU

00:25:33.164 --> 00:25:35.700
THINK ABOUT DTSC REFORM AND

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:38.570
PRIOR TO REFORM. PRIOR TO ME

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:39.838
COMING TO THE DEPARTMENT,

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:43.375
FRANKLY, I WAS AGHAST AT HOW

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:45.844
MANY PERMITS WERE EXPIRED FIVE

00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:49.347
YEARS, TEN YEARS, 20 YEARS OLD,

00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:52.384
AND SINCE COMING TO DTSC, I'VE

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.454
LEARNED THAT THE CONTINUED

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:59.090
PERMIT OR EXPIRED PERMIT

00:25:59.157 --> 00:26:01.559
DOESN'T PRECLUDE US FROM TAKING

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:02.694
ENFORCEMENT ACTION IF A

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.362
HAZARDOUS WASTE LAW IS VIOLATED,

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:07.165
BUT IT DOES LIMIT OUR ABILITY

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.901
TO REGULATE FACILITIES BECAUSE

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:12.103
THE PERMIT COMES WITH

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:12.804
REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.906
THAT HAVE TO BE MET FOR

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:15.874
OPERATION. AND SO IT'S SIMPLY

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:17.842
NOT GOOD GOVERNMENT TO LET

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:20.712
THESE PERMITS CONTINUE AND

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:22.948
EXPIRE FOR SO LONG. SO I'M

00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:25.750
HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WITH THE

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:28.853
DRAFT PERMIT PROPOSAL FOR THE

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.256
BUTTONWILLOW CLEAN HARBORS

00:26:31.323 --> 00:26:32.924
LANDFILL THAT WE JUST ISSUED

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:35.794
LAST MONTH, THAT CLEARED THE

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.595
DECK OF THE LONGEST STANDING

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:38.797
CONTINUED PERMITS AT THE

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:42.567
DEPARTMENT. AND THAT'S A HUGE

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:43.735
ACHIEVEMENT FOR OUR STAFF. IT'S

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:46.171
A BIG WIN FOR THE COMMUNITIES

00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:47.739
BECAUSE NOW THERE'S STRICTER

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.908
STANDARDS IN THE PERMITS THAT

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:52.777
FACILITIES HAVE TO MEET, AND

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:55.981
IT'S TIED TO MODERNIZING OUR

00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:57.949
HAZARDOUS WASTE SYSTEM ACROSS

00:26:58.016 --> 00:27:01.019
THE STATE AS WELL. WE CAN'T

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.821
MODERNIZE OUR HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:27:02.887 --> 00:27:03.989
FACILITIES IF WE LET THESE

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:05.957
PERMITS LANGUISH. SO WE'RE

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.959
COMMITTED TO STAYING ON TOP OF

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:09.594
THESE PERMITS, NOT LETTING THEM

00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:12.364
LAPSE. AND REFORM GAVE US

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.099
STATUTORY CHANGES THAT HELP,

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:16.968
BECAUSE NOW PERMIT TEAMS HAVE

00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:18.136
AN EARLIER DEADLINE TO SUBMIT

00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:20.171
THEIR APPLICATION A YEAR AHEAD

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:23.041
OF EXPIRING. SO THAT GIVES US A

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:25.910
RUNWAY NOW TO REVIEW. IT'S A

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:27.979
VERY TIME INTENSIVE PROCESS TO

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:30.815
REVIEW PERMITS AND, YOU KNOW,

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:32.884
GO THROUGH THE HEALTH RISK

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:35.320
ASSESSMENT, THE ENGINEERING

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:37.322
CONTROLS, TO ENSURE THAT IF WE

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:39.924
DECIDE TO RENEW A PERMIT,

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:42.761
BECAUSE WE MAY NOT IF WE DON'T

00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:45.663
SEE ENOUGH PROTECTIONS FOR THE

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:52.203
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NEARBY.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.706
BEYOND OUR REFORM MANDATES. I

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:56.708
DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS WELL,

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:57.909
A COMMITMENT THAT WE MADE

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:58.843
DURING LAST YEAR'S OVERSIGHT

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.414
HEARING WITH REGARDS TO SAFER

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.916
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. WE

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:07.285
MADE SOME COMMITMENTS REGARDING

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:10.188
PRIORITY PRODUCTS, MAKING

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:14.159
PROGRESS WITH PHASING OUT

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:16.661
HARMFUL CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:19.497
WE ARE STILL WORKING TOWARDS

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:22.734
MEETING THOSE COMMITMENTS.

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:25.403
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.607
IS CAREFULLY DESIGNED TO PHASE

00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:35.380
OUT OR PROHIBIT, IF NECESSARY,

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:37.082
CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE

00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:40.118
HARMFUL TO CONSUMERS, AND IT IS

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:41.886
A SCIENTIFICALLY RIGOROUS

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:44.756
PROCESS THAT THAT WILL PREVENT

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:47.325
AVOIDABLE SUBSTITUTIONS, WHICH

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:50.862
COULD HAPPEN IF THAT SCIENTIFIC

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:53.832
RESEARCH ISN'T CONDUCTED TO

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:56.201
FULLY VET THOSE REGRETTABLE

00:28:56.267 --> 00:29:01.005
SUBSTITUTIONS. AND IT'S OFTEN

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:02.874
PRIME FOR THINGS WHERE THERE'S

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:05.310
NOT A READILY AVAILABLE

00:29:05.376 --> 00:29:06.044
ALTERNATIVE. AND SO THAT

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:06.744
RESEARCH, THAT INNOVATION IS

00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:10.615
NEEDED BY THE SCP PROGRAM. AND

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.951
WHAT WE'VE ALSO LEARNED IS THAT

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:15.086
PRIORITY PRODUCT LISTINGS,

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:20.258
WHILE THEY ARE A HUGE CRITICAL,

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:21.893
YOU KNOW, ASSET TO THE PROGRAM,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.795
IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY. AND IT'S

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:25.830
DEFINITELY NOT THE QUICKEST WAY

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:26.998
THAT OUR PROGRAM HAS HAD AN

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:31.202
IMPACT ON PHASING OUT CHEMICALS.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:34.739
OFTENTIMES EARLY IN THE PROCESS,

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:36.975
MARKET SIGNALS ARE SENT TO

00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:39.144
SHIFT AWAY FROM HARMFUL

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.578
CHEMICALS. AND WE'VE SEEN THIS

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:41.846
HAPPENING WITH A SHIFT AWAY

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:43.882
FROM CHEMICALS AND VINYL

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.950
FLOORING AND PFAS IN CARPETS

00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:50.155
AND RUGS, AS WELL AS PFAS IN

00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:51.389
TEXTILE AND OTHER LEATHER

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.926
TREATMENTS. SO USING THIS

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.362
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO PREVENT

00:29:57.428 --> 00:30:01.766
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS. WILL

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:04.068
CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY. AND

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:07.572
SPENT MUCH OF LAST YEAR SETTING

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:08.940
A STRONG FOUNDATION TO SET US

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:11.809
UP FOR SUCCESS. WE NOTICED FOUR

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:13.711
RULEMAKING PACKAGES TO ADVANCE

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:16.881
THE PROGRAM AND ITS IMPROVEMENT

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:19.184
TO PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES, WITH

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.519
AMENDMENTS TO THE SCP FRAMEWORK.

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:23.688
UNDER THE NEW SENATE BILL 502

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:26.357
AUTHORITIES, AND WE CLARIFIED

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:27.725
COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS FOR

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:30.895
IMPORTERS OF REGULATED PRODUCTS.

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:33.064
WE ALSO ADDED MICROPLASTICS TO

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:35.600
THE CANDIDATE CHEMICAL LIST.

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:38.369
AND THIS SENDS A SIGNAL TO

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:41.439
INDUSTRY THAT MICROPLASTICS

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:44.008
THAT ARE AVOIDABLE IN PRODUCTS

00:30:44.075 --> 00:30:48.213
SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. THIS IS A

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.181
GROUNDBREAKING MOVE THAT WILL

00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:52.917
ALLOW SCP IN THE FUTURE TO

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:54.185
REGULATE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:57.455
OR GENERATE MICROPLASTICS AS

00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:58.790
NECESSARY. THIS, AGAIN, IS

00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:01.359
UPFRONT WORK THAT IS NEEDED TO

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:03.928
MAKE CERTAIN THAT FUTURE

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:06.231
PRIORITY PRODUCT LISTINGS ARE

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:12.036
SUCCESSFUL. SO IN CLOSING, WITH

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:15.406
OUR COMMITMENT TO TIMELY,

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:16.608
CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT, TO

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:18.876
ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, TO

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:21.946
COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES, OUR

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:23.147
DEPARTMENT IS POSITIONED TO

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:25.717
ENTER A NEW ERA IN WHICH IT

00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:27.986
LEADS THE NATION IN PROTECTING

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:30.255
PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH

00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:31.322
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:34.259
REGULATIONS. OUR STAFF ARE

00:31:34.325 --> 00:31:36.060
RELENTLESSLY DEDICATED AND

00:31:36.127 --> 00:31:38.429
TOGETHER AS A TEAM WITH THE

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:39.397
COLLECTIVE WISDOM FROM OUR

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:40.932
PARTNERS, THE LIVED EXPERIENCES

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:43.568
FROM THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE.

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:44.936
WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR MISSION

THE BOARD MUST DECREASE FEES,

00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:07.959
SINCE WITHOUT A REDUCTION, THE

TWO ACCOUNTS WILL BE WELL OVER

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.996

SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS. WE

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.762
RECOGNIZE THAT DEVELOPING A NEW

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:45.997
FUNDING MODEL WILL REQUIRE

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:48.799
THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND WILL BE

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:50.234
SOLICITING PUBLIC INPUT. MORE

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:52.603
GENERALLY ON FEES, DTSC IS IN

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.072
BETTER STANDING AS COMPARED TO

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:55.840
PRE-REFORM. HOWEVER, THE

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:57.675
HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT,

00:37:57.742 --> 00:37:58.976
WHICH INCLUDES REVENUE FROM THE

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.578
GENERATION AND HANDLING FEE,

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:02.179
REMAINS IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT.

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.148
THE BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS THAT

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.650

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:07.051
RATE OF THE GENERATION AND

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:09.153
HANDLING FEE IN SB 158 PROVED

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.921
TO BE FAR TOO LOW, RESULTING IN

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:13.224
A SHORTFALL THAT REQUIRED LOANS

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.793
TO KEEP THE ACCOUNT SOLVENT. WE

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.228
REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THE

00:38:17.294 --> 00:38:18.029
GENERATION AND HANDLING FEE MAY

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:19.697
NEED TO BE INCREASED IN THE

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.966
FUTURE TO ENSURE THAT REVENUES

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:23.601
AND EXPENDITURES REMAIN

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.736
BALANCED. OF RELEVANCE HERE,

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:26.937
WE'VE ALSO HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT

00:38:27.004 --> 00:38:28.105
THE PROSPECT OF ANY FURTHER

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:29.874
EXEMPTIONS FROM FEES, AS THE

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.976
EXISTING FEE PAYER BASE THEN

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.078
RETAINS THE BURDEN FOR PAYING

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.013
FOR DTSC ACTIVITIES. SO I'LL

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.549
NOW SPEAK TO THE BOARD'S WORK

00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:39.950

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:41.719

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.287
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:45.589

PLAN AS THE PRIOR STRATEGIC

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:06.610
PLAN EXPIRED IN 2024. DTSC IS

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:07.711
CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:10.114
STRATEGIC STRATEGIC PLAN, AND A

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:10.714
NEW FORWARD LOOKING PLAN WILL

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.349
BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:14.151
GUIDING DTZ'S FUTURE WORK AND

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:15.919
SHARING ITS WORK AND SUCCESS

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:16.920
WITH THE PUBLIC. FINALLY, MANY

00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:19.223
OF THESE AREAS POINT TO A

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:19.790
CAUTIOUS APPROACH WITHIN THE

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:20.858
DEPARTMENT. WHILE THIS CAN LEAD

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.860
TO MORE CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL

00:44:22.926 --> 00:44:24.028
DECISIONS, IT CAN ALSO LEAD TO

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:25.763
DELAYED DECISIONS AND STIFLED

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.031
INNOVATION. I BELIEVE THERE'S

00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:28.966
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DTSC TO TAKE

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.135
MORE PROACTIVE AND BOLD ACTIONS,

00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:31.802
INCLUDING IN RELATION TO THE

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:33.904
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN.

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:36.306
ON THE OTHER HAND, DTSC IS

00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:37.474
SUCCEEDING IN THE FOLLOWING

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:39.910
AREAS. FIRST, DTSC SENIOR

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:41.045

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.649
I'VE HEARD BOTH ADVOCATES AND

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:46.984

00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:57.861
RESPONSIVENESS AND COMPLETED

00:44:57.928 --> 00:45:00.097

CLEANUP BY THE END OF FEBRUARY

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:05.002
2025. THIRD, AS DIRECTOR BUTLER

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.702
MENTIONED, DTSC ISSUED A

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:06.970
REGULATION THAT STRENGTHENED

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:07.905
THE COLLECTION RATE AND

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:09.740
COMPLIANCE FOR THE GENERATION

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:10.908
AND HANDLING FEE, REDUCING ITS

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:14.011
OVERALL DEFICIT. FOURTH, DTSC

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.813

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.548
HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY PERMIT

00:45:17.614 --> 00:45:18.949
DECISIONS FOR SEVERAL COMPLEX

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:21.051
AND CONTROVERSIAL FACILITIES,

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:22.186
NEARLY COMPLETING THE BACKLOG

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:24.755
OF LONG EXPIRED PERMITS. FIFTH,

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:28.292
DTSC MET THE CLEANUP GOAL OF

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:28.859
5940 RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:30.427
SURROUNDING THE FORMER EXIDE

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:32.796
FACILITY. AND FINALLY, DIRECTOR

BUTLER MENTIONED DTSC

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:35.833
ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS HAVE

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:39.169
IMPROVED LARGELY AS A RESULT OF

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:39.736
DTSC LEADERSHIP PRIORITIZING

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:41.738
THIS ISSUE. LOOKING AHEAD, THE

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:42.906
BOARD WILL FOCUS ON THE

00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:44.942
FOLLOWING IN THE NEXT SEVERAL

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:45.742

THREE FEES THAT SUSTAIN DTSC.

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:51.949
THE BOARD WILL ALSO CONSIDER

00:45:52.015 --> 00:45:53.083
APPROVING DIRECTOR BUTLER'S

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.718
FISCAL YEAR 25 AND 26

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.820
PRIORITIES AT ITS MEETING IN

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.155
NOVEMBER. THE BOARD ANTICIPATES

VOTING ON THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:01.725
MANAGEMENT PLAN. THE BOARD IS

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.026

PROTECT FACILITY IN SANTA FE

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:09.867
SPRINGS. AS DTSC FINALIZES

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.902
SEVERAL OTHER HIGH PROFILE

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:18.876
LITIGATION REGARDING AN EARLIER

ENCOURAGE PUBLIC COMMENT AND

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:26.950
ENGAGEMENT IN ALL FACETS OF OUR

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:29.486
OPERATIONS. IN MY REMARKS HERE,

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:30.053
AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.288
OPPORTUNITY AND I LOOK FORWARD

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:33.790
TO RECEIVING ANY QUESTIONS.

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.092
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:36.793
APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOUR

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.295
TESTIMONY AND FOUND IT VERY

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:39.563
INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE. I

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:43.867
WANTED TO. SO I RECOGNIZE THE

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:45.636
BROAD RANGE OF THINGS THAT DTSC

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:48.572
IS DOING. AND DIRECTOR BUTLER,

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.807
YOU MENTIONED THEM AND THEN

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:51.975
CHAIR RAKESTRAW, YOU ALSO

00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:54.878
REEMPHASIZE THEM AND AND, YOU

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:56.113
KNOW, PARTICULARLY SOME OF

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.649
THESE THE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE

00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:00.050
HAPPENING, GOOD STAFFING, LÃ,

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:02.719
FIRE RESPONSE, FINAL DECISIONS

00:47:02.786 --> 00:47:04.788
BACKLOG IS GETTING CLEARED. ONE

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:07.024
OF THE THINGS I DIDN'T HEAR YOU

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.259
FOCUS ON THAT. AND MAYBE IT'S

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:10.861
AN ACRONYM THAT'S BURIED

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:12.129
UNDERNEATH OTHER THINGS YOU

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:14.865
SAID. BUT BUT THE EXTENDED

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:15.599
PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.701
PROGRAMS, THE EPR PROGRAMS, I

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:20.070
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

00:47:20.137 --> 00:47:21.738
REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:24.241
IS THAT THAT WE DO LIVE IN AN

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:24.908
ENVIRONMENT WHERE OUR

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:25.776
REGULATORY SYSTEM WORKS REALLY

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:26.977
CLOSELY WITH THE INDUSTRIES

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:29.012
THAT ARE REGULATED. AND SO

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:31.081
EXTENDED PRODUCER

00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:32.883
RESPONSIBILITY IS, IS SAYING

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.785
THAT THE THOSE WHO MAKE THE

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:36.253
COMPANIES WHO MAKE AND

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:36.920
DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS ARE

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:38.155
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM ON THE

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:41.892
BACK END AND, AND TO FIGURE OUT

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:43.694
A WAY TO HAVE BOTH DISPOSAL

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.396
CLEANUP OR A SUBSTITUTION OF

00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:48.832
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, BE DRIVING

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:50.000
THE DECISION MAKING THAT

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:52.669
COMPANIES ARE MAKING. AND SO

00:47:52.736 --> 00:47:54.972
THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:56.206
DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF THIS. AND

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.874
I WILL JUST NOTE THAT THERE ARE

00:47:57.941 --> 00:47:58.976
CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS, LIKE, FOR

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.143
EXAMPLE, IN BRITISH COLUMBIA,

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.178
THAT ARE JUST MUCH MORE

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.746
ADVANCED WHEN IT COMES TO

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:03.847
EXTENDED PRODUCER

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:05.616
RESPONSIBILITY IN AREAS LIKE

00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:08.085
SOLAR PANEL RECYCLING, ELECTRIC

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.920
VEHICLE RECYCLING, THE CONSUMER

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:10.988
PRODUCTS LIKE HOUSEHOLD

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:13.156
HAZARDOUS WASTE, AND WE HAVE

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.625
HAD SEVERAL BILLS. THIS IS MY

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.893
SECOND YEAR OF RUNNING A BILL

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.663
ON AN EPR PROGRAM ON MARINE

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.832
FLARES. AND AND SOME OF MY

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:23.367
COLLEAGUES HAVE ALSO RUN BILLS

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.736
THAT ARE SIMILAR. SENATOR ALLEN

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:27.504
HAS HAD TWO IMPORTANT ONES SB

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:29.306
501 ON HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:32.476
WASTE, SB 615 ELECTRIC VEHICLE

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:36.146
BATTERIES. AND WHAT WE SEE IS

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:37.681
THAT THAT THE FISCAL COST, THE

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.916
DTSC, PUTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:43.453
OF COST ON A BILL LIKE THIS,

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.821
AND SUGGESTING THAT THE

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:45.689
RESOURCES AND THE STAFF

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:48.392
NECESSARY TO GET SOMETHING OFF

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:50.127
THE GROUND IS JUST ENORMOUS. I

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:53.864
MEAN, IT IS STRIKING TO TO THE

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.232
OFFICES THAT ARE RUNNING THESE

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:56.800
BILLS AND THEN ALSO TO THE

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.135
ADVOCATES WHO ARE SUGGESTING

00:48:58.201 --> 00:49:00.671
THAT PROGRAMS COULD BE RUN IN A

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.939
LEANER WAY. AND, YOU KNOW, I

00:49:03.006 --> 00:49:04.508
THINK YOU SEE THIS ACROSS ALL

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:05.642
PARTS OF GOVERNMENT AND

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:07.878
CRITICISMS OF US AT THE STATE

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:08.745
OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY, BUT

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:10.881
JUST THAT WE CAN'T GET OUT OF

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:12.049
OUR OWN WAY, THAT WE'RE SO

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.684
BURDENED BY OUR OWN PROCESS, BY

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.018
OUR PLANNING ON TOP OF PLANNING,

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:17.354
ON TOP OF PLANNING AND OUTREACH.

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:18.655
THAT'S REPETITIVE AND JUST

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:21.958
TAKES YEARS AND YEARS TO GET

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:23.794
RULEMAKING ACCOMPLISHED OR SOME

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.996
OF THESE THINGS. I MEAN, AS WAS

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:26.863
MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR THAT

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:28.932
LEAD TO DELAY AND AND JUST

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:31.001
BASICALLY INACTION WHEN WE WANT

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:32.869
TO SEE ACTION. AND SO MY I FEEL

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:34.071
AS IF THERE'S ROOM FOR

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.073
IMPROVEMENT HERE. AND I'M, I

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:38.909
WISH THAT YOU EITHER OF YOU HAD

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:40.243
TALKED ABOUT EXTENDED PRODUCER

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.978
RESPONSIBILITY. IT IS SOMETHING

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:44.948
THAT HAS BEEN MORE CENTERED IN

00:49:45.015 --> 00:49:45.882
CALRECYCLE, BUT BECAUSE THERE

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:48.251
ARE SO MANY TOXIC MATERIALS

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:49.720
THAT NEED EPR PROGRAMS, YOU

00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:50.854
KNOW, WE NEED TO HAVE A

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.389
PARTNERSHIP WHERE YOU'RE EITHER

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:53.623
LOOKING TO CALRECYCLE TO HELP

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.192
DO SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:57.327
THEY ALREADY ARE DOING, OR THAT

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:58.662
YOU'RE ABLE TO DEVELOP THAT

00:49:58.729 --> 00:50:01.031
EXPERTISE OR WILL ESSENTIALLY

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:04.701
TO TAKE THIS ON IN HOUSE. AND I

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.036
JUST, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO ASK

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:07.804
IT AS A QUESTION, WHICH IS, ARE

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:10.006
THERE WAYS HOW CAN WE DRIVE

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:11.875
DOWN THE COSTS, YOU KNOW, BY

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:13.043
EITHER USING EXISTING RESOURCES

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.978
THAT EXIST IN THE STATE OR WHY

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:16.780
IS IT SO EXPENSIVE AND LABOR

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.849
INTENSIVE WHEN YOU ANALYZE IT?

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:20.650
BECAUSE IT CAN SOMETIMES FEEL

00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:22.786
AS IF, WHEN THERE'S SUCH A HIGH

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:23.987
FISCAL COST, PUT ON IT WITH A

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:25.789
HUGE NUMBER OF STAFF THAT NEED

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.858
TO BE HIRED FOR AN EPR PROGRAM

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:29.126
THAT HAS LITERALLY ONE PRODUCER

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.827
IN IT, YOU KNOW, YOU WONDER, IS

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:32.829
THIS AN EFFORT TO NOT DO THIS

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:33.697
WORK BECAUSE THERE'S A DESIRE

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:34.898
TO JUST NOT HAVE THIS BE

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:36.967
SOMETHING THAT IS PUT ONTO YOUR

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:38.668
PLATE. AND SO SO MY QUESTION IS

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:40.971
HOW HOW CAN WE MAKE THESE

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.939
PROGRAMS LESS EXPENSIVE OR LESS

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.841
LABOR INTENSIVE TO HAVE A MORE

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:46.877
STREAMLINED, STRAIGHT PATH TO

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:50.147
HAVING DTSC BE INVOLVED IN EPR

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:52.249
PROGRAMS THAT THAT ARE REALLY

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:53.884
CRYING OUT FOR THEM, AND YOU

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.019
CAN BOTH ANSWER. YEAH, THANK

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.754
YOU FOR THAT. AND THANK YOU FOR

00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:59.990
YOUR LEADERSHIP WITH THE MARINE

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:02.726
FLARE ISSUE, WHICH IS AN

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:05.028
IMPORTANT ONE TO PREVENT THE

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:07.030
ILLEGAL DISPOSAL. AND, YOU KNOW,

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:10.534
IT'S AN EXPLOSIVE HAZARDOUS

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.037
WASTE. WE DO HAVE THE MERCURY

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:16.840
THERMOSTAT EPR PROGRAM AT DTSC,

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:19.676
AND IT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.912
PROGRAM. AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.780
AND WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS IS THE

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.782
IMPORTANCE OF THE ENFORCEMENT

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.317
COMPONENT TO MAKE EPR

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:31.188
SUCCESSFUL IN THE LONG RUN. AND

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:32.956
THAT REQUIRES MORE RESOURCES

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:35.125
FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT,

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:37.060
TO DO THE PROPER AUDITS AND

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:39.963
THAT SORT OF THING. PERHAPS,

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.631
YOU KNOW, SOLUTIONS THAT WE DO

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.233
NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.268
LOOKING AT IS PARTNERING WITH

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:48.805
LOCAL AUTHORITIES, YOU KNOW,

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:50.540
THE LOCAL COUNTY COOPERS, FOR

00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:54.277
EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, OTHER

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:56.913
ENTITIES THAT CAN PARTNER ON

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.983
THAT ENFORCEMENT PIECE WITH US.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.952
WE ALSO KNOW AND WE'VE BEEN

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:06.089
CAREFUL IN HOW WE APPROACH THE

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:07.290
RESOURCE PROPOSALS, BECAUSE WE

00:52:07.357 --> 00:52:08.658
KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:11.595
TO INSPECT EVERY SINGLE

00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:13.163
COLLECTION POINT. FOR EXAMPLE,

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.999
FOR AN EPR PROGRAM. AND SO, YOU

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:18.702
KNOW, THERE'S OTHER WAYS, LIKE

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.003
I SPOKE ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.771
COMMUNICATING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.740
ACTIVITIES. THERE'S OUTREACH

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.876
ENFORCEMENT CAN LOOK DIFFERENT

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:28.879
WAYS. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:30.981
BEEN THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:34.184
APPROACH THE RESOURCES. WE ARE

00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:35.719
SAYING WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:37.053
THESE. BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.589
HAVE AN ESTABLISHED EPR PROGRAM

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:40.857
AT OUR DEPARTMENT, IN ORDER FOR

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:43.360
US TO GET IT OFF THE GROUND, IT

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:45.662
WILL REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES.

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:49.266
OKAY. DO YOU WANT TO SAY

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:49.866
ANYTHING ON THIS TOPIC? OKAY.

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:52.435
YEAH. I MEAN, I WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:53.637
A CLOSER PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:55.805
EXISTING STRUCTURES AT

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.040
CALRECYCLE, AND I APPRECIATE

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:58.208
THE FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT. I DO

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.743
THINK CALRECYCLE COULD DO A

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:01.278
LITTLE MORE ENFORCEMENT ON SOME

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:02.178
THINGS. AND THE ENFORCEMENT IS

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:03.213
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.014
YOU'RE NOT ENFORCING THAT,

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.949
NOBODY TAKES IT SERIOUSLY. SO

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:06.883
THINKING AHEAD ABOUT THAT IS

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:08.718
IMPORTANT. BUT THERE'S ALSO,

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:10.954
YOU KNOW, IT REALLY CAN

00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:11.755
COLLAPSE UNDER ITS OWN WEIGHT

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.990
AND NOT AND FAIL TO LAUNCH

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:15.025
ESSENTIALLY. AND I DO PERCEIVE

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:16.726
THAT THAT'S CURRENTLY WHAT'S

00:53:16.793 --> 00:53:17.761
HAPPENING ACROSS THE RANGE OF

00:53:17.827 --> 00:53:19.996
THINGS. AND I, I HOPE, YOU KNOW,

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:22.165
CALIFORNIA, AS A LEADER IN OUR

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:22.732
PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT,

00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:24.901
MEANS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ALL

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:26.202
OF THESE TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:27.904
MATERIALS SERIOUSLY AS

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:30.040
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.908
ADDRESSING, YOU KNOW? SO I'LL

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:34.678
TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES

00:53:34.744 --> 00:53:35.879
HERE. CHAIR CONNELLY, DO YOU

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:38.648
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? I DO, AND

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:40.617
THANK YOU AS WELL FOR THE

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:42.018
TESTIMONY. I WANTED TO I THINK

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:43.853
YOU COVERED A LOT OF GROUND. I

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.189
WANTED TO DRILL DOWN ON A FEW

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:48.792
OF THE TOPICS. AND DIRECTOR,

00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:51.227
MAYBE STARTING WITH YOU. YOU

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:52.696
REFERENCED THE IMPORTANT WORK

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:55.465
GOING ON IN CLEANING UP THE

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:59.803
WILDFIRE SITES IN LOS ANGELES.

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:02.405
SPECIFICALLY, YOU STATED PHASE

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:04.608
TWO OF THE CLEANUP IS ALMOST

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:07.877
COMPLETE. WHAT REMAINS, FROM

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:10.347
YOUR UNDERSTANDING TO TO

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:13.116
COMPLETE. SO I UNDERSTAND IT'S

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.884
SUBSTANTIAL. IT'S SUBSTANTIVELY

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:16.987
COMPLETE FOR THE RESIDENTIAL.

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:18.088
THERE'S STILL SOME COMMERCIAL

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:19.923
PROPERTIES THAT NEED TO BE

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.592
CLEARED. AND NOW, FOR THE MOST

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:25.095
PART, SURVIVORS ARE ENGAGED IN

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:27.263
ASSESSING THEIR PROPERTY

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:28.999
CONDITION, PREPARING IT FOR

00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:30.800
REBUILD. AND THE COUNTY

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:33.203
RECENTLY RELEASED A BLUEPRINT

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:34.804
TO HELP RESIDENTS STEP BY STEP.

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:37.107
HOW TO DO THAT. IT REFERENCES

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:38.742
OUR EXISTING STATE STANDARDS

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:42.212
FOR SOIL CLEANUP, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:45.382
AND THAT CAN BE USED AS A GUIDE

00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:47.384
FOR FOR RESIDENTS WHO ARE

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.653
REBUILDING. SO PEOPLE ARE VERY

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:50.720
MUCH ENTRENCHED IN THE

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:51.855
REBUILDING PROCESS RIGHT NOW.

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:53.990
YEAH. SO IN TERMS OF YOUR

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:55.692
UNDERSTANDING THEN, ARE THESE

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:58.895
HOME SITES NOW SAFE OF TOXIC

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:02.832
MATERIALS AND READY TO REBUILD?

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:05.001
YEAH. SO THE COUNTY HAS DONE.

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:05.735
AND ALSO UNIVERSITIES,

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.604
NONPROFITS HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:09.839
TESTING AND OFFERING FREE SOIL

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:12.342
TESTING PROGRAMS FOR RESIDENTS.

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.844
SO RESIDENTS, SURVIVORS HAVE

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:19.049
BEEN SAMPLING LEARNING ON A

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.283
CASE BY CASE BASIS WHAT THEIR

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.752
CONDITIONS LOOK LIKE. YOU KNOW,

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:25.955
FOR THE MOST PART, THOSE SOIL

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:28.224
CONDITIONS ARE SAFE FOR REBUILD.

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:30.760
BUT BECAUSE OF THE VAST NATURE,

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:33.363
THE HIGH WINDS, THE SPECIFIC,

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.699
YOU KNOW, DENSE URBAN AREA, YOU

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:38.268
KNOW, THERE ARE PROPERTIES THAT

00:55:38.334 --> 00:55:41.438
MAY FIND CONCENTRATIONS OF LEAD

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:42.939
OR ARSENIC ABOVE SCREENING

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:47.077
LEVELS. AND THAT'S WHERE, YOU

00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:48.978
KNOW, THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:50.780
DEPARTMENT FROM A TECHNICAL

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:51.748
PERSPECTIVE. AND THE

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:53.950
UNIVERSITIES, TOGETHER WITH THE

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:56.586
COUNTY, CAN ASSIST RESIDENTS IN

00:55:56.653 --> 00:56:00.123
HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT. AND, YOU

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.258
KNOW, WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:04.728
SURVIVORS, IF THEY DO GET

00:56:04.794 --> 00:56:07.030
ELEVATIONS BACK, THAT THEY HIRE

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:08.798
AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONAL

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.800
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:12.769
THEIR THEIR PLOT FULLY

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:14.337
CHARACTERIZED BEFORE REBUILD.

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:18.141
OKAY. MOVING ON TO HAZARDOUS

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.410
WASTE FEES. APPRECIATED. YOUR

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:23.113
NOTE OF SOME CHANGES IN THE

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:25.615
BUDGET REGARDING THE FEES.

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.984
BOTTOM LINE IS THE REVENUE

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:31.154
COMING IN NOW MATCHING THE

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:34.991
ESTIMATED REVENUE THAT WAS

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.894
ANTICIPATED, SUCH THAT IS THE

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.764
FUND NOW STABLE IN YOUR VIEW?

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:42.665
YES. IT'S STABLE. SO

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.701
SPECIFICALLY, WE WERE

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:45.735
PREVIOUSLY BRINGING IN ONLY

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:48.204
ABOUT 40 MILLION. AND WITH ALL

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.840
THE CHANGES NOW, WE BROUGHT IN

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:52.876
67 MILLION THIS LAST FISCAL

00:56:52.942 --> 00:56:56.246
YEAR, TOGETHER WITH THE VACANCY

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:57.714
REDUCTIONS. NOW WE'RE STABLE

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:00.250
BECAUSE THE WE REDUCED OUR

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:01.684
TOTAL BUDGET BY 18 MILLION,

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:04.654
ALMOST $19 MILLION. SO THAT ALL

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:06.856
ADDS UP TO US. YES. BEING

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.958
STABLE NOW. AND WE'RE IN A GOOD

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:09.793
PLACE NOW WHERE WHERE WE'RE

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:12.829
EVEN ABLE TO REPAY MOST OF OUR

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:14.731
LOAN THAT WE HAD, WHICH IS ALSO

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:16.966
GOOD NEWS FOR US. BUT WE DO

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:18.601
HAVE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT STILL,

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:19.836
WE'RE CHIPPING AWAY AT BUT ON

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:22.338
AN ANNUAL BASIS, WE'RE LOOKING

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:23.740
WE'RE LOOKING GOOD. GREAT.

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:27.577
FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU ABOUT

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.712
THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:33.316
PROGRAM. SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:34.717
SB 158, WE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:37.587
INCREASED FEES TO GIVE DTSC

00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:41.658
STAFF. SPECIFICALLY, WE ROUGHLY

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:43.760
DOUBLED THE SIZE OF THE STAFF

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:45.595
FOR THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:49.866
PROGRAM. TT SC SAID IN BUDGET

00:57:49.933 --> 00:57:52.001
DOCUMENTS THAT BEGINNING IN

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:55.805
2023, THEY OR YOU WOULD ADOPT

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:58.942
FIVE PRIORITY PRODUCTS PER YEAR.

00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:01.244
I BELIEVE THAT DTSC HAS ONLY

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.880
ADOPTED THREE PRIORITY PROJECT,

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:07.550
WITH A FOURTH LIKELY THIS YEAR,

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:10.153
WHEN WE SHOULD BE AT ABOUT 15

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.756
PRODUCTS BY NOW. SO IF YOU CAN

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:16.125
GIVE US THAT ASSESSMENT, WHAT'S

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:18.161
HAPPENING IS IS THE PROGRAM

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:20.930
BROKEN? CAN IT BE FIXED? AND IS

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:22.866
IT TIME TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.801
NOT WE CAN KEEP THIS PROGRAM?

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:26.569
YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.671
COMMENT. AND AS WE HEARD FROM

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:30.940
CHAIR RAKESTRAW, WE ARE

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:31.641
RECEIVING THAT FEEDBACK THAT

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:33.209
IT'S NOT KEEPING PACE WITH

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.711
THOSE EXPECTATIONS. SO PERHAPS

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:38.047
I CAN EXPLAIN A BIT WHAT THE

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:39.649
PROGRAM HAS BEEN UP TO AND

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:40.750
WHERE WE'RE HEADED IN MORE

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:42.919
DETAIL. SO THESE PAST TWO YEARS

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.721
HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON RAMPING UP,

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:47.156
PUTTING THOSE NEW RESOURCES TO

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:49.726
GOOD USE. THE RESULTS ARE

00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:51.928
ALREADY VISIBLE. WE HAVE NOW

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:53.997
OVER 40 TECHNICAL SCIENTIFIC

00:58:54.063 --> 00:58:55.965
PROJECTS UNDERWAY, WHICH IS

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:58.101
DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS

00:58:58.167 --> 00:59:00.837
THAT WERE UNDERWAY IN 2022. SO

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:03.973
BASED ON THESE NUMBERS, WE ARE

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.842
PROJECTING TO REGULATE ABOUT 13

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:07.710
CONSUMER PRODUCTS OVER THE NEXT

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:10.046
2 TO 3 YEARS, WHICH WILL BRING

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:12.515
US IN LINE WITH THAT TOTAL GOAL

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.050
OF NOTICING FIVE LISTINGS PER

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:17.053
YEAR. SO, YOU KNOW, THOSE

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:17.754
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES DID

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:20.290
SUPPORT THE FULL SPECTRUM OF

00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:24.160
SCP. IT'S NOT BROKEN. IT'S VERY

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:25.561
WELL THOUGHT OUT PROGRAM THAT

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:26.696
PRIORITIZES THE PRODUCT

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:28.765
RESEARCH RULE MAKING. THEY'RE

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:31.334
SUPPORTING POST RULEMAKING

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.503
ACTIVITIES. THEY'RE EXTENSIVE

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:34.671
ALTERNATIVE ANALYZES, WHICH NOW

00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:36.839
WITH SENATE BILL 502 WILL BE

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:38.041
ABLE TO CIRCUMVENT WHEN THEY'RE

00:59:38.107 --> 00:59:39.709
NOT NEEDED, WHICH IS A GOOD

00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:41.878
DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL OF US. WE

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.646
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE,

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.249
COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. AND

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:47.717
THEN JUST, YOU KNOW, HIGH LEVEL

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:51.988
COUPLE EFFECTIVE NOTES THAT THE

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:53.723
THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:55.792
ACCOMPLISH UP TO A QUARTER

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:56.759
MILLION POUNDS OF PFAS HAVE

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:57.860
BEEN REMOVED ANNUALLY BY

00:59:57.927 --> 01:00:00.530
REGULATING PFAS IN CARPETS, UP

01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:02.398
TO 1.3 MILLION POUNDS OF

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:04.133
METHYLENE CHLORIDE REMOVED

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.903
ANNUALLY THROUGH OUR REGULATION

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.906
OF METHYLENE CHLORIDE IN PAINT.

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.140
SO THIS SHEER VOLUME OF

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.842
REMOVING CHEMICALS FROM THE

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.610
MARKET HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE. I

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:17.413
THINK WE NEED TO DO A BETTER

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:17.914
JOB COMMUNICATING THESE

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.649
ENDPOINTS, THESE OUTCOMES,

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:20.850
ESPECIALLY AS WE PROCEED

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.885
TURNING THOSE 40 TECHNICAL

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.787
REPORTS INTO THE 13 PRIORITY

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:25.922
PRODUCT LISTINGS OVER THE NEXT

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.024
SEVERAL YEARS, SO THAT WE CAN

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:29.325
GET TO PAR WITH WHAT YOU'RE

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:30.860
TALKING ABOUT. GREAT.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.462
APPRECIATE IT. AND THEN ON

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.897
PERMITS, I BELIEVE THE USUAL

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:37.633
LENGTH OF A PERMIT IS TEN YEARS.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.303
HOWEVER, SEVERAL RECENT PERMITS

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.772
HAVE BEEN FOR FIVE YEARS. CAN

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:45.041
YOU TELL US THE RATIONALE FOR

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.743
ISSUING THE PERMITS FOR FIVE

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.911
YEARS? YEAH. SO LIKE I

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.113
MENTIONED, SOME OF THESE

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:52.015
PERMITS HAVE BEEN EXPIRED FOR

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.950
SOME TIME. AND IT'S AN

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:54.884
INTERESTING FACT THAT

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.085
ORIGINALLY WHEN DTSC FIRST

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:58.855
STARTED INTEREST IN ISSUING

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:00.923
PERMITS, WHEN THE PROGRAM FIRST

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.059
STARTED, MANY OF THEM WERE FIVE

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.695
YEARS OR LESS BECAUSE IT WAS A

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.830
FIRST PERMIT. AND SO IN SOME

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.198
WAYS, THESE RENEWALS ARE LIKE A

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.968
FIRST PERMIT. AND THE TWO THAT

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.803
WE HAVE ISSUED FOR FIVE YEARS,

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:16.272
WHICH IS LESS THAN THE TEN, HAS

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.940
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT COMPLIANCE

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.742
HISTORY. WHILE THOSE TWO

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.878
FACILITIES ARE NOT IN THE

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.780
UNACCEPTABLE TIER OF OUR

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:25.048
SCORING PROGRAM, THAT WOULD

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:29.085
TRIGGER A PATH TO DENIAL. WE'RE

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:29.952
LOOKING AT THE VERY SPECIFIC

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:32.655
COMPLIANCE HISTORY, AND WE

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:34.824
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT EARLIER

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.692
CHECKPOINT OF FIVE YEARS IS

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:39.595
IMPORTANT TO HOLD THE FACILITY

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:40.930
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE NEW

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.865
STANDARDS IN THAT PERMIT. OKAY.

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:46.469
GREAT, CHAIR RAKESTRAW, JUST A

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.704
COUPLE QUESTIONS. GIVEN YOUR

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.773
RECENT APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.343
AND WELCOME ABOARD. COULD YOU

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.778
GIVE US YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS

01:01:55.845 --> 01:02:00.450
OF DTSC? HOW ARE THINGS AS THEY

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:06.222
CURRENTLY STAND? THANKS SO MUCH.

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:08.424
YES, I'M FOUR MONTHS INTO THE

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.859
ROLE APPROXIMATELY, I THINK. I

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.095
MEAN, THE THE OVERVIEW THAT I

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:12.995
GAVE DURING THE TESTIMONY, I

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.364
THINK IS, IS, IS MY GENERAL

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:16.966
IMPRESSIONS, WHICH IS THAT THE

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.801
DIRECTOR HERE HAS ASSEMBLED AN

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:20.470
EXCELLENT TEAM. THEY'VE BEEN

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:21.838
VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE BOARD. I

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.873
RECEIVED A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.208
BRIEFINGS, BEEN UNIVERSALLY

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.310
IMPRESSED AT THE AT THE CALIBER

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.078
OF THE WORK. OF COURSE, YOU

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:30.880
KNOW, MY ROLE ALSO IS GETTING A

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.949
BROAD RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES AND

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.217
MEETING WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS,

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:35.318
MEETING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:36.819
ORGANIZATIONS, MEETING WITH THE

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:38.721
REGULATED COMMUNITY. SO, YOU

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:40.289
KNOW, I'M STILL IN THE PROCESS

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:41.858
OF SYNTHESIZING ALL OF THOSE,

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.659
BUT I WOULD SAY THE OVERALL,

01:02:43.726 --> 01:02:44.994
YOU KNOW, FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:46.929
POSITIVE. I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:49.732
AND THEN TO TOUCH ON THE

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:50.933
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.336
APPRECIATE YOUR DISCUSSION OF

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:55.972
THAT. YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:58.808
FEEL THAT THE AGENCY SHOULD

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:02.979
TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.915
OVERALL. FROM OUR STANDPOINT,

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:07.783
SITTING HERE AS PART OF THAT,

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:09.051
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU SEE THAT

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:13.156
WE AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.157
WITH IN TERMS OF SHORING THAT

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:16.959
UP? AND ALSO, DO YOU THINK

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:19.662
THERE ARE ANY CHANGES,

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:20.930
PARTICULARLY TO THE PROCESS

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:23.065
THAT YOU SEE THAT COULD BE

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:24.967
HELPFUL? AND IS THERE ANY ROLE

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:28.905
FOR US? I THINK DIRECTOR BUTLER

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.706
WILL SURELY HAVE SOMETHING TO

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:32.008
SAY ABOUT THAT. BUT I MEAN, I

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:33.943
WOULD NOTE A GOOD NUMBER OF THE

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.678
GOALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:38.214
WITHIN THE PLAN WILL REQUIRE

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.949
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. SO I

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:41.417
WOULD FULLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.119
AND I THINK IT'S INDICATED BY

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.154
AN ICON WITHIN THE PLAN, BUT I

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:45.888
WOULD FULLY ANTICIPATE THAT

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:48.658
DTSC WILL COME BACK WITH BC AS

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:51.627
A RESULT OF THIS. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:52.795
THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:55.097
REASON WHY THE BOARD IS REALLY

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:56.566
KIND OF SCRUTINIZING EACH ONE

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:57.767
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MEETS THE

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:59.802
STATUTORY MANDATE. AND THAT'S

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.137
ALSO PART OF THE REASON WHY THE

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:03.773
BOARD HAS ASKED FOR KIND OF A

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.875
HIERARCHY OF, OF THESE GOALS,

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:07.977
BECAUSE THERE IS AN ENORMOUS

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:10.146
AMOUNT IN THERE. AND I THINK

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:11.881
GETTING DTSC FOCUSED ON KIND OF

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.049
WHERE IT'S GOING TO START WILL

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:15.785
BE IMPORTANT ON, YOU KNOW, ONE

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:18.621
OTHER THING, YOU KNOW, ONE OF

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.789
THE THOUGHT COMES TO MIND,

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.857
WHICH IS IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:23.693
VIEWS ON OVERALL QUANTITATIVE

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:24.827
REDUCTION GOALS FOR SPECIFIC

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:28.764
WASTE STREAMS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:29.899
THAT'S KIND OF A FLEDGLING

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:32.134
DISCUSSION WITHIN THE PLAN. BUT

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:35.371
IF THERE ARE KIND OF

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:35.805
ASPIRATIONS THAT THE

01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:37.139
LEGISLATURE HAS THERE, THAT

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.141
WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW, GREAT.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:41.410
APPRECIATE IT. THEN FINALLY,

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:44.313
YOU COVERED THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:48.951
FEES AND BACKING UP A STEP. I

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:51.020
MEAN, IF YOU COULD GIVE US A

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.688
SENSE, WHAT IS YOUR OVERALL

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:55.925
APPROACH TO EVALUATING THOSE

01:04:55.992 --> 01:05:00.796
FEES? YEAH. SO THE THE BOARD'S

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:03.899
ROLE IS TO SET THE FEE RATES

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.835
FOR EACH OF THE THREE FEES. AND

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.870
SO WHAT THAT NECESSARILY

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.105
INVOLVES IS A REALLY

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:11.207
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH DTSC

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:13.676
AND DTSC FINANCIAL TEAM, WHERE

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:16.979
BASICALLY THEY PROVIDE US WITH

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:19.181
ALL THE FINANCIALS OF DTSC, THE

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.917
FUND CONDITION STATEMENTS. WE

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:22.918
ASK AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:25.054
PROBING QUESTIONS TO FIGURE OUT

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:28.057
KIND OF HOW HOW IT ALL ADDS UP.

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:30.860
AND THEN BASED ON ALL OF THAT,

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:31.927
THE BOARD THEN PUTS FORWARD A

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:35.231
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:36.799
THAT ARE I'M SORRY, THE BOARD

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:37.933
SUBCOMMITTEE PUTS FORWARD A

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.135
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.636
FOR THE BOARD'S CONSIDERATION.

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.772
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:45.741
BOARD'S ROLE IS RELATIVELY

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:47.777
CONSTRAINED, PARTICULARLY

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:51.080
BECAUSE THERE IS A 10% MAXIMUM

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:53.616
STATUTORY RESERVE SET BY SB 158.

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:55.951
AND SO AS A RESULT, THE BOARD

01:05:56.018 --> 01:06:00.423
CAN'T KIND OF GO IN LEFT FIELD

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:01.857
AND RAISE FEES DRAMATICALLY

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:04.060
WHEN THE FUND IS OTHERWISE

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.995
BALANCED. AND SO THAT KIND OF

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.863
NARROWS THE THE OPTIONS THAT

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.832
THE BOARD SUBCOMMITTEE IS ABLE

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:12.101
TO PUT FORTH BEFORE THE BOARD

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:12.902
FOR APPROVAL. DO YOU MIND IF

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:14.136
THE DIRECTOR ANSWERS THAT

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.971
QUESTION TO YOU ABOUT ANY

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.707
LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT COULD

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.875
HELP SUPPORT OR ACCELERATE

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:21.677
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN OR.

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:23.813
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.014
SO I ANTICIPATE MANY

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.148
OPPORTUNITIES ACTUALLY TO

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:27.850
COLLABORATE WITH THE

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.518
LEGISLATURE, LEGISLATURE ON

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:31.754
THIS, BECAUSE WE'RE ESSENTIALLY

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.055
REVOLUTIONIZING OUR HAZARDOUS

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:36.392
WASTE SYSTEM, WHICH MEANS OUR

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.894
LAWS. AND IT DOVETAILS BACK TO

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:39.829
YOUR COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT, YOU

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:42.531
KNOW, BEING ABLE TO RECYCLE

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:44.667
SOLAR PANELS. ALSO, LITHIUM

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:45.868
BATTERIES, ALL OF THESE

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.603
EMERGING WASTE STREAMS FROM

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:51.407
GREEN ENERGY SECTOR. WE HAVE

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:52.742
STATUTORY LIMITATIONS IN WHAT

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:55.878
WE CAN AND CANNOT DO AS FAR AS

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.012
HANDLING THOSE MATERIALS. AND

01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:58.681
THEY'RE THERE FOR A REASON TO

01:06:58.748 --> 01:06:59.915
PROTECT HEALTH AND SAFETY. BUT

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:02.918
THEY'RE, YOU KNOW, AS A RESULT

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:05.054
OF THE RESEARCH AND INNOVATION

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:07.757
FROM THE PLAN, WE MAY COME UP

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:10.926
WITH NEW WAYS TO REGULATE

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.028
CERTAIN MATERIALS THAT PROMOTE

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:16.031
MORE RECYCLING, REUSE, WASTE

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:18.300
DIVERSION AND WASTE REDUCTION

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.770
SO THAT, YOU KNOW, CHANGING OUR

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:22.138
LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS GOING

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.006
TO BE CRITICAL TO IMPLEMENTING

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:28.210
SOME OF THESE CHANGES. THE

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:29.779
REPORTING, YOU KNOW, FREQUENCY

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:30.980
EVERY THREE YEARS OF THE

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:32.148
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:33.816
REPORT, WE PRODUCE EVERY THREE

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.918
YEARS. AND THEN WE PRODUCE A

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.653
PLAN EVERY THREE YEARS. AND WE

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.755
HAVE A VERY SMALL TEAM THAT IS

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:41.957
DOING ALL OF THIS WORK. AND SO

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:42.825
OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.794
IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.897
IS IN SOME WAY THWARTED BY THAT

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.932
SAME TEAM HAVING TO PRODUCE THE

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:51.734
NEXT REPORT. RIGHT? SO WE DON'T

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:52.768
WANT REPORTING JUST FOR

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:55.938
REPORTING SAKE, BUT WE DO, YOU

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.840
KNOW, WE FIND IT VALUABLE. SO,

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.609
YOU KNOW, THINKING ABOUT THAT

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:01.877
REPORTING FREQUENCY COULD HELP

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:05.347
US BE MORE EFFICIENT IN

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:05.714
IMPLEMENTING THE

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:09.652
RECOMMENDATIONS. YEAH. CHAIR,

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:11.854
ARE YOU FINISHED WITH YOUR

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.122
QUESTIONS? OKAY. I'D LIKE TO GO

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.791
TO OUR COLLEAGUES HERE. WELCOME.

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.326
SENATOR MENJIVAR AND SENATOR

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:18.761
REYES. SENATOR, WOULD YOU LIKE

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.095
TO GO FIRST WITH SOME QUESTIONS?

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.698
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I KNOW

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.266
WE'VE BEEN HAVING SOME BACK AND

01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:26.535
FORTH CONVERSATION ON THE

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.003
HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMITTING, SO

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:29.772
I APOLOGIZE IF SOME OF IS

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.607
REDUNDANT. BUT FIRST, I'D LIKE

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:32.808
TO KNOW, DIRECTOR, HOW WE

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:35.611
BALANCE AND YOU KNOW, CHAIR

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:37.780
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED ASKING THE

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:39.114
REDUCTION INTO THE FIVE YEARS

01:08:39.181 --> 01:08:41.116
AND I GET THAT RIGHT. WE WANT

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.318
TO HOLD THESE FACILITIES MORE

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:44.086
ACCOUNTABLE. HOW DO WE BALANCE

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:46.055
THAT, KNOWING THAT THERE ARE

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.823
MORE VOLUME AND HAZARDOUS

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.625
HAZARDOUS WASTE AND LESS

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.861
FACILITIES TO TAKE ON THAT

01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:53.095
VOLUME WITH THE IMPACTS THAT

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.196
THESE FACILITIES ARE HAVING IN

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:56.232
THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE'S A

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.500
NEED FOR THEM BECAUSE OF THE

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:58.701
INCREASED VOLUME. BUT THE

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:00.002
FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:02.338
NOW HAVE A HISTORY, LIKE YOU

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:02.972
MENTIONED, OF THESE VIOLATIONS

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.306
AND THE IMPACTS IN THESE

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:05.875
COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:07.710
DECADES OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:10.179
APPEALING TO THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.647
REFUSE PERMITS OF THESE

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:12.848
FACILITIES. HOW ARE YOU

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:15.017
BALANCING THAT LOADED QUESTION?

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:17.720
YEAH, NO THANK YOU. AND THAT IS

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:20.489
THE QUESTION FOR OUR PERMITS.

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:24.693
AND WE REVIEW A PERMIT IN TERMS

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.862
OF ITS ENGINEERING CONTROLS, IN

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:29.598
TERMS OF ITS SAFEGUARDS THAT IT

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:32.601
HAS. AND IT'S PROPOSING SO THAT

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:34.703
EMISSIONS FROM THAT FACILITY

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.872
DON'T GO OFF SITE AND DON'T

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.108
IMPACT COMMUNITIES. AND IF

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:41.443
THOSE SAFEGUARDS AREN'T IN A

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.645
PERMIT APPLICATION, WE SEND A

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:45.114
NOTICE OF DEFICIENCY TO THE

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.116
PERMIT TÃ AND TELL THEM TO FIX

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:49.351
THEIR PERMIT APPLICATION SO

01:09:49.418 --> 01:09:51.287
THAT THEY'RE PROTECTING THE

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:52.922
COMMUNITIES AND IMPLEMENTING

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:55.224
THE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS. SO

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:58.794
WE USE A VARIETY OF TOOLS TO

01:09:58.861 --> 01:09:59.828
ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:03.098
SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE. BESIDE

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:03.866
ENGINEERING EVALUATIONS, WE

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.167
HAVE HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:07.836
THAT ARE NOW REQUIRED FOR

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:10.139
CERTAIN FACILITIES. AND WITH

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.675
OUR CURRENT WORK IMPLEMENTING

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.476
SB 673, THAT WILL CONTINUE TO

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.844
STRENGTHEN THE HEALTH RISK

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.947
ASSESSMENT, WHICH IS OUR, YOU

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:21.283
KNOW, MORE OBJECTIVE TOXICOLOGY

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:24.053
TOOL TO ESTIMATE IF THERE'S ANY

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:27.022
POTENTIAL HARM THROUGH A MODEL

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.925
TO THE COMMUNITIES. AND, YOU

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:32.928
KNOW, IF THAT HEALTH RISK

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:35.197
ASSESSMENT SHOWS AN

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:37.700
UNACCEPTABLE RISK, THEN THE

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:38.934
FACILITY IS REQUIRED TO TAKE

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:41.604
ACTION TO PREVENT THAT RISK AND

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:46.809
LOWER IT. AND LET'S SEE, WE USE

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.811
ALSO THE INFORMATION THAT WE

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:49.812
RECEIVE FROM THE PUBLIC DURING

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:52.181
THE COMMENT PERIODS OF THE

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.882
DRAFT PERMIT. SO WE ISSUE A

01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:55.618
DRAFT FIRST SO THAT THE PUBLIC

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:57.820
CAN COMMENT. AND THEN THAT

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:58.687
OFTEN RESULTS, ESPECIALLY IN

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:00.756
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, IN

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:02.891
TANGIBLE CHANGES TO THE FINAL

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:03.826
PERMIT. SO FOR FIBRO TECH

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.828
FACILITY IN SANTA FE SPRINGS,

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:07.896
FOR EXAMPLE, THAT'S ONLY 500FT

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:08.831
AWAY FROM RESIDENTS. AND IT'S

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:10.733
VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:12.668
FACILITY IS TAKING THE UTMOST

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:15.137
CARE AND IMPLEMENTING ALL THE

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.605
SAFEGUARDS POSSIBLE, ESPECIALLY

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:20.109
BECAUSE IT HAS A HISTORY OF

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:21.944
RELEASES. SO THE NEW PERMIT

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:24.780
THAT WE ISSUED WOULD REQUIRE,

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:26.015
AND IT'S CURRENTLY BEING

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:27.783
APPEALED RIGHT NOW, BUT IF IT

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:30.285
GOES INTO EFFECT, IT WOULD

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:31.687
REQUIRE COMMUNITY AIR

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:32.821
MONITORING, A COMMUNITY HEALTH

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:35.591
AND SAFETY PLAN, MORE RIGOROUS

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.860
ENGINEERING CONTROLS, ON SITE

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:39.428
HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:41.830
PROGRAMS FOR THE EMPLOYEES. AND

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:45.668
SO WE'VE TAKEN THE CHANCE WITH

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:46.835
THE NEW THE RENEWAL TO

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:48.203
IMPLEMENT THESE NEW

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:51.273
REQUIREMENTS TO TO ENSURE THE

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.143
SAFETY IF DISPERSIONS HAVE

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:55.911
HAPPENED, LIKE ECHO BAT, YOU

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:58.047
KNOW, LEAD CAME INTO THE

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:58.747
RESIDENTIAL AREAS. YOU JUST

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:01.550
GAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE. AND THE

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.852
PERMITS ARE ARE RENEWED. AGAIN,

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:04.920
HOW MANY INCIDENTS NEED TO

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:06.989
OCCUR, YOU KNOW IN THE

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:10.125
COMMUNITIES TO I FORGOT THE

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:11.160
PHRASE YOU MENTIONED THAT IT

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:13.862
MOVES IT INTO THE UNACCEPTABLE

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:16.699
TIER. CAN'T REMEMBER THAT IF

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.233
FACILITIES HAVE HAD A HISTORY

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.703
OF HAZARD GOING INTO OUR

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:21.970
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES. I

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:24.073
GUESS I'M NOT. I'M NOT HEARING

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.974
THE TRIGGER OF WHEN IT BECOMES

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:28.077
SERIOUS. FOR ME, THAT ONE ONE

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:30.212
INCIDENT IS ALREADY SERIOUS IN

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:32.247
A COMMUNITY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:33.649
NUMBER WE'RE LOOKING FOR UNTIL

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.951
IT BECOMES A FACILITY THAT

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.886
CANNOT CONTINUE OPERATING. AND

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:39.822
THEN THAT'S MY QUESTION. HOW DO

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:40.989
YOU BALANCE THAT? OR COULD YOU

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:42.825
NOT MAKE THAT DECISION? BECAUSE

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:43.959
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FACILITIES

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.861
TO TAKE ON THAT HAZARDOUS WASTE.

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:46.829
SO THEN BY DEFAULT, THESE

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:49.364
COMMUNITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:50.399
IMPACTED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:53.335
CAPACITY IN OTHER FACILITIES.

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:56.338
YEAH. THANK YOU. SO IT'S NOT

01:12:56.405 --> 01:13:01.043
JUST THE SPECIFIC SCORE OR THE

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:04.012
MOST RECENT INCIDENT. IT'S THE

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:06.048
TREND. RIGHT. SO FOR BOTH

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:08.250
FIBROTIC AND ECHO BAT THEY'VE

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:12.387
HAD AN INCREASING TREND TOWARDS

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:13.989
HIGHER COMPLIANCE. LIKE THEY

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.657
ARE IMPROVING THEIR COMPLIANCE

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.793
RATES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.762
YEARS. IF THEY HAD A TREND

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.897
GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION,

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:25.033
THEN WE MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:29.171
DENIED THEIR PERMIT. OKAY, SO

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:30.773
THAT INCIDENT, AS LONG AS I

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.241
TREND UP, I CAN HAVE ANOTHER

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:33.742
BAD INCIDENT AND THEN AS LONG

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.844
AS I TREND UP AGAIN, I WILL BE

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.312
COMPLIANT. IT ALSO DEPENDS ON

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.381
THE NATURE OF THE INCIDENT AND

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:41.116
THE SPECIFICS. YET WE TAKE ALL

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.751
OF THE, YOU KNOW, VERY

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:44.787
SPECIFICS INTO INTO ACCOUNT.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.856
AND FOR FOR ECHO BAT, YOU

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.124
MENTIONED THAT, YOU KNOW, LEAD

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:53.095
IS GOING OFF SITE AND IT'S MORE

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.797
OF A HISTORICAL CONCERN THAT WE

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:57.299
HAVE. YEAH. AND SO NOW THEY

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.034
HAVE AN ENGINEERING CONTROL

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.836
THAT CAPTURES THE MAJORITY OF

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.771
LEAD. SO IT DOESN'T IMPACT THE

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:05.741
COMMUNITY. THANK YOU DIRECTOR.

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:08.143
MR. CHAIR, YOU MENTIONED YOU

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.778
VISIT FACILITIES. YOU TALKED

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:12.247
ABOUT PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.782
THE DEPARTMENT. AND I DON'T

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:16.185
THINK YOU WENT INTO THE DETAILS

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:16.919
OF WHAT THOSE PERFORMANCE

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:19.321
METRICS WERE. I'D LIKE TO HEAR

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.923
A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND IF THE

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.091
BACKLOG HAS THAT BEEN ADDRESSED,

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:24.293
IS THAT PART OF THE PERFORMANCE

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:26.929
METRICS FOR THE DEPARTMENT?

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:29.965
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:31.700
SO FOR PERFORMANCE METRICS, THE

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:34.036
BOARD HAS NOT FINALIZED OR

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:36.004
ADOPTED PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:36.872
ANY OF THE PROGRAMS JUST YET.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:40.075
WE ARE WE ARE AT THE FINAL

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.144
STAGES FOR THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.278
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, AND THAT

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:45.681
INCLUDES THE DRAFT INCLUDES

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.249
CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS NUMBER

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:47.983
OF EXPIRED PERMITS AND THE

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.885
BACKLOG AND SO ON. SO THAT'S

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:50.819
THAT'S CERTAINLY A MAIN

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:52.688
CONSIDERATION FOR THE BOARD. AS

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:53.856
I MENTIONED, WE'RE ALSO

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:56.225
STARTING JUST NOW THE SAFER

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.960
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. I

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.862
THINK WE HAVE A LOT WE HAVE

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:02.197
LEARNED A LOT IN THIS HAZARDOUS

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:03.298
WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.234
PROCESS. AND SO I THINK WE'RE

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:05.934
AIMING TOWARDS A MUCH MORE

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.169
STREAMLINED PROCESS TO GET

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:09.104
PERFORMANCE METRICS ADOPTED FOR

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.639
ALL THE REMAINING PROGRAMS AS

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:12.140
FAST AS POSSIBLE. IS THERE A

01:15:12.207 --> 01:15:13.842
DEADLINE OR A TIMELINE FOR THAT?

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:16.645
WE DON'T HAVE A DEADLINE JUST

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:18.814
YET. I THINK WE HAD SAID WE'RE

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.582
AIMING BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:21.750
YEAR FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.285
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO ADOPT

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:24.786
THOSE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.788
I WOULD IMAGINE IN THE FIRST

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.690
HALF OF NEXT YEAR AS WELL, AND

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.192
THEN WE'LL KEEP GOING THROUGH

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:30.926
THE REMAINING PROGRAMS. AND

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:33.128
WHEN YOU VISIT FACILITIES

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.897
THROUGH THE CAPACITY OF THE

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:36.865
BOARD, WHAT AUTHORITY DOES THE

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:39.001
BOARD HAVE WHEN AT THOSE

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:39.801
FACILITIES FOR ANY VIOLATION?

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.904
IS THERE AUTHORITY THAT GO THAT

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:43.438
TRANSFERS OVER? IS THERE

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.574
REPORTING THAT THEN HAPPENS TO

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.109
THE TO THE DEPARTMENT WHEN

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:48.710
YOU'RE ON THOSE FACILITIES? WE

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:49.945
DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.980
AUTHORITY IN TERMS OF

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:52.714
ENFORCEMENT OR INSPECTIONS OR

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.850
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WHAT WE ARE,

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:56.752
WHAT WE ARE DOING WHEN WE VISIT

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.120
THE FACILITIES IS WILL BE

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.656
MEETING WITH THE WILL OFTEN GET

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:01.823
A TOUR WITH THE FACILITIES,

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.926
WILL MEET WITH THE FACILITY

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:06.194
OPERATORS WILL MEET WITH THE

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.063
IMPACTED COMMUNITIES, WILL TRY

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.999
TO GET A FULL PICTURE OF THE

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.801
FACILITY AND ITS INTERACTIONS

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:14.636
AND ITS IMPACT ON THE

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:15.837
COMMUNITIES WILL THEN BRING

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.873
THAT BACK TO THE BOARD MEETINGS.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.008
WE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.910
HOLD SPECIFIC HEARINGS ON

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:23.645
SPECIFIC PERMITTED SITES OR

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.914
CLEANUP SITES. WE'VE DONE THAT

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:27.616
A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE PAST.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:28.850
WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT THIS YEAR

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:31.119
BECAUSE THE FOCUS IS ON BEEN ON

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:32.154
THE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.655
PLAN. BUT I THINK FROM MY

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:34.890
PERSPECTIVE, I'M HOPING TO USE

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:38.760
THAT TOOL IN THIS NEXT YEAR AS

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:40.729
MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO TRY TO

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:44.333
DRILL DOWN INTO SITES THAT HAVE

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:46.001
SPECIFIC COMMUNITY CONCERNS,

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:48.103
PARTICULAR CLEANUP SITES AS

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:51.473
WELL. OKAY. THANK YOU. OKAY.

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.643
THANK YOU, SENATOR REYES, THANK

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:58.246
YOU SO MUCH, MADAM CHAIR. AND

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:00.716
THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE.

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:04.019
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT ON SO MANY

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.855
LEVELS. AND WE OVER THE YEARS

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:09.691
I'VE BEEN ON THE COMMITTEE AND

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:12.194
HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.795
TALKING TO THE DIRECTORS AND

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.831
ABOUT THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:17.199
WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:21.636
HERE. AND WE OFTEN HEAR THAT

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:22.838
THERE'S MORE AND MORE BEING

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:26.241
DONE. AND YET OUR MOST

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.844
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE.

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:31.646
AS MY COLLEAGUE ASKED ABOUT,

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.915
THEY CONTINUE TO BE THE ONES

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.752
WHO SUFFER THE MOST FROM THIS.

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:39.588
AND THERE, THERE, THERE HAS TO

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:42.257
BE MORE THAT WE CAN DO. IN THE

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:44.126
BACKGROUND PAPER, IT HIGHLIGHTS

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:47.129
THAT THE FEEDBACK TO GOAL ONE

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:48.997
REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:49.664
IMPACTS BY PROMOTING

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.400
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.602
INITIATIVES. AND I QUOTE, LACKS

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:55.804
MEANINGFUL RECOMMENDATIONS TO

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:57.105
REDUCE THE IMMEDIATE

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.673
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.109
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:02.577
COMMUNITIES PROXIMAL TO

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:08.550
PERMITTED FACILITIES. I HAVE

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:13.188
FIRST A A REQUEST, AND THAT

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:17.926
REQUEST IS THAT AND MAYBE JUST

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:20.595
A LITTLE ODD HERE, BUT SO

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:21.963
IMPORTANT, SO IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:25.600
COMMUNITY. BUT TO TO REQUEST A

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:28.837
COMMITMENT TO SINCERELY

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:30.105
UNDERSTANDING THE COMMUNITY

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:32.874
CONCERNS AND IMPLEMENTING

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:35.177
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT USE THE

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.946
STATE'S POWER AND INFLUENCE TO

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:40.282
SOLVE PROBLEMS FOR UNDERSERVED

01:18:40.348 --> 01:18:43.318
COMMUNITIES, WE NEED TO SERVE

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:43.852
TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:46.054
COMMUNITIES FIRST, AND THERE'S

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.722
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:49.891
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.660
SUFFERING THE MOST. THEY'RE THE

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:55.330
ONES WHO GET SELECTED FOR THOSE

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:59.000
PERMITTED WASTE FACILITIES FOR

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:04.973
THOSE PERMITTED. EVENTS THAT,

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.509
IN THE END, HARM OUR

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:13.949
COMMUNITIES. I DON'T WANT A

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:16.751
JUST A PRETTY PICTURE. WE WANT

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.920
TO BRAVELY ADDRESS OUR AREAS OF

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:20.689
GROWTH SO THAT PEOPLE ARE SAFE

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:24.025
AND HEALTHY. I WANTED TO BEGIN

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:27.896
WITH THAT. YOU'RE VERY NEW.

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:29.931
YOU'RE FAIRLY NEW TO HAVE THAT

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:32.701
KIND OF COMMITMENT BECAUSE THE

01:19:32.767 --> 01:19:34.769
STATE IS WILLING TO THE

01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:37.139
LEGISLATURE IS WILLING TO HELP.

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:37.739
YOU HEARD THAT FROM

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:39.040
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CONLEY, FROM

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.510
CHAIR CONLEY, FROM CHAIR BLAKE

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:43.778
SPEER. WE'RE READY TO HELP. BUT

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:45.647
THERE HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:47.916
REQUESTS SO THAT WE CAN THEN

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:49.885
STEP IN, WHETHER IT'S THROUGH

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:52.020
LEGISLATION, THROUGH FUNDING,

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.788
FUNDING, YOU KNOW, THE FUNDING

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:55.657
REQUESTS COME IN ALL THE TIME,

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:57.826
AND IN THE END, THEY ARE

01:19:57.893 --> 01:19:59.828
APPROVED. WHO KNOWS THIS YEAR,

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:03.165
RIGHT. BUT IT'S EXTREMELY

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:04.633
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:07.402
COMMITMENT TO PROTECT OUR MOST

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:08.770
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND I

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.972
HOPE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:12.874
THAT WE CAN GET FROM BOTH OF

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:15.810
YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR, I

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:17.712
APPRECIATE THAT. AND YES, YOU

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:20.215
HAVE MY FULL COMMITMENT TO DO

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.684
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:25.220
LEVERAGE THE FULL EXTENT OF OUR

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:27.355
AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:30.392
VULNERABILITIES. AND WE'RE

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.661
OFTEN CHALLENGED BECAUSE OUR

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:35.263
SPECIFIC AUTHORITY FOR A

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:36.831
PERMITTED FACILITY, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:39.234
IS SPECIFIC TO HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:43.438
TREATMENT OR DISPOSAL. AND IT

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:46.708
DOESN'T ENCOMPASS SOME OF THE

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.777
QUOTE UNQUOTE, PUBLIC NUISANCE,

01:20:48.843 --> 01:20:51.813
ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT AN ADEQUATE

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.615
WORD FOR WHAT COMMUNITIES ARE

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.250
EXPERIENCING. BUT THAT'S THE

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:58.019
LEGAL TERM. WE OFTEN LACK THAT

01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:00.188
AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:01.890
THESE MORE HOLISTIC IMPACTS

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:03.725
THAT COMMUNITIES ARE

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.894
EXPERIENCING. AND THAT IS A

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:07.662
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR US.

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.798
YOU KNOW, TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:11.633
THE LANDFILL SITUATION WHERE

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:15.971
RESIDENTS ARE SUFFERING SERIOUS

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:19.040
SYMPTOMS, AND WE ARE DOING

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:20.675
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. WE

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:23.378
ISSUED AN IMMINENT AND

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.012
SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT ORDER,

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:27.382
MULTIPLE ORDERS TO THE FACILITY

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:29.618
AND AND THE RESIDENTS ARE STILL

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:33.555
SUFFERING. AND SO I DO

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:34.756
APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:37.058
LOOK MORE CLOSELY, PERHAPS AT

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.760
OUR AUTHORITIES, PERHAPS AT OUR

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:40.895
TOOLS THAT WE HAVE OR DON'T

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:43.632
HAVE TO MORE FULLY,

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:46.735
HOLISTICALLY ADDRESS THE LIVED

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:52.907
EXPERIENCE OF RESIDENTS. I I'LL

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.876
JUST I'LL JUST ADD, I MEAN, I

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:56.011
STARTED MY REMARKS BY BY

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:58.146
UNDERLINING MY COMMITMENT, MY

01:21:58.213 --> 01:21:59.281
PERSONAL COMMITMENT, AND THE

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:00.115
BOARD'S COMMITMENT TO

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:01.683
ADDRESSING THE DISPROPORTIONATE,

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.985
TOXIC BURDEN ON CERTAIN

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:05.720
COMMUNITIES. AND SO THAT THAT I

01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:07.789
VIEW AS ONE OF THE CORE

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:09.057
RESPONSIBILITIES AND ROLES OF

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:12.160
THE BOARD IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:12.994
WE ARE GOING OUT INTO

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:13.928
COMMUNITIES. WE ARE MEETING

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:17.098
WITH THEM, WE ARE MAKING SURE

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:17.666
THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD, AND

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:18.933
THAT DSC IS HEARING THOSE

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.969
VOICES AS WELL. SO YOU HAVE MY

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:23.004
COMMITMENT AS WELL. THANK YOU.

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.906
AND THEN GOING BACK TO THAT

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:28.677
GOAL, ONE, I DO ASK, CAN YOU

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:29.844
ELABORATE ON WHAT SOME WHAT

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:31.179
SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:32.714
HAVE BEEN SO FAR RELATED TO

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.749
GOAL ONE? DOES THE LEGISLATURE

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.117
NEED TO PROVIDE MORE DIRECTION

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:38.687
ON HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL?

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:43.058
AND I WILL COMMENT THAT IT IS

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:43.958
CONCERNING TO ME THAT THIS GOAL

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:46.661
DOESN'T HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:50.965
RECOMMENDATIONS. SO THROUGH THE

01:22:51.032 --> 01:22:53.368
PUBLIC COMMENT AND THE LAST

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.704
HEARINGS, WE ARE GOING TO BE

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:58.173
REORGANIZING AND REVISING THE

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:02.844
PLAN TO REFLECT MORE SUCCINCTLY.

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:04.879
MOST LIKELY THREE GOALS INSTEAD

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.848
OF TEN. SO WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:08.683
VERY FOCUSED ON WASTE WASTE

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:12.454
DIVERSION, WASTE REDUCTION,

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.089
PROTECTING HEALTH. I DON'T HAVE

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.824
SPECIFICS ON WHAT THOSE

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.026
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE, BUT I

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:20.295
THINK YOU'RE ECHOING A LOT OF

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:21.496
THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:23.298
DURING THIS PUBLIC HEARING

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:26.167
PROCESS THAT OUR TEAMS ARE

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:27.902
WORKING CLOSELY TO IMPLEMENT IN

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:33.908
THE FINAL PLAN. YEAH. THANK YOU.

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:37.479
ANOTHER QUESTION. YEAH. OKAY.

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:39.581
WELL, THEN I'M GOING TO SKIP

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:40.849
THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION. I'M

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:43.084
GOING TO ASK ANOTHER ONE

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:48.223
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT LANDFILLS.

01:23:48.289 --> 01:23:52.894
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. IT'S AND

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:53.728
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT IS

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:57.999
WIDESPREAD ACROSS MANY AREAS.

01:23:58.066 --> 01:23:59.901
IT APPEARS THAT WE NEED A

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:02.003
STATEWIDE LOOK AT THE LANDFILLS

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.171
AND THE SOLUTION TO PREVENTING

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:06.608
LEACHATE MAKING. IT'S MAKING

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:10.211
PEOPLE DEBILITATINGLY ILL. IS

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:11.312
THERE SOMETHING THAT IS BEING

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:14.949
DONE ABOUT THAT? I MEAN, THIS

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:17.952
IS THE FIRST TIME IN THAT I'M

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:20.054
AWARE OF THAT. OUR DEPARTMENT

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:21.689
WITH HAZARDOUS WASTE PURVIEW IS

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:23.892
GETTING INVOLVED IN A MUNICIPAL

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:26.094
NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE LANDFILL

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:27.295
BECAUSE THE LEACHATE IS SHOWING

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.631
HAZARDOUS WASTE CHARACTERISTICS.

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:32.000
SO THAT ALONE, OUR INVOLVEMENT

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:33.701
IN THE SITUATION IS WHAT WE'RE

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:35.804
DOING ABOUT IT, TO INSERT OUR

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.605
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WHERE WE

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:41.910
CAN WHEN IT COMES TO STATEWIDE,

01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:45.814
WE ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.017
OTHER LANDFILLS AND, YOU KNOW,

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:50.552

AT LEAST IN THE EPA FAMILY,

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:54.823
ABOUT WHAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.658
ACROSS THE BOARD TO PREVENT

01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:57.892
OTHER EVENTS LIKE THIS FROM

01:24:57.959 --> 01:25:01.162

IMPORTANT TO SEAB AS WE

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:14.922
SUBJECT MATTER AREAS TO AVOID A

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.924

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:53.761
ENSURING THAT WE'RE BALANCING

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:55.596
THE NEED TO MAINTAIN IMPORTANT

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:59.367
CAPACITY IN STATE TO MEET THE

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:00.601
STATE'S HAZARDOUS MANAGEMENT

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.770
NEEDS, AS WELL AS ADDRESSING

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:04.038
KEY ISSUES RELATED TO THE

01:29:04.105 --> 01:29:05.873
FISCAL HEALTH OF THE DEPARTMENT

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:08.943
AND PERMITTING CONDITIONS. IN

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.712
TERMS OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:12.013
MANAGEMENT PLAN, SEAB STRONGLY

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.981
SUPPORTED THE INCLUSION OF THAT

01:29:14.048 --> 01:29:16.384
IN SB 158. IT WAS ACTUALLY

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:18.386
SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN A

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:19.721
REQUIRED OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:22.023
SOME TIME BUT NOT COMPLETED, SO

01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:23.725
WE WERE CERTAINLY VERY

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:24.826
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:25.927
ADVOCATED AS PART OF THAT

01:29:25.993 --> 01:29:28.763
PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY, FOR THE

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:29.931
DEVELOPMENT OF THAT PLAN TO BE

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:31.933
EXPEDITED FROM WHERE THE

01:29:31.999 --> 01:29:34.135
INITIAL CONVERSATIONS HAD BEGUN

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.970
AND ENSURE THAT THE PLAN AND

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:36.838
ITS DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE FUNDED

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:38.806
THROUGH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS.

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:40.875
AND WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:41.709
POINT SPECIFICALLY SHORTLY,

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:43.344
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:45.346
IMPORTANT AND BROAD BENEFIT TO

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:48.182
THE ENTIRE STATE, AS SEAB HAS

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:50.384
APPRECIATED THE TIME THE DTSC

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:51.753
TEAM HAS TAKEN TO DRAFT THE

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:54.689
PLAN, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:55.656
COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:56.824
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT IN

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.726
CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE IT

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:00.828
REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT START

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.864
TO LAYING OUT INITIAL AREAS OF

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:05.833
FOCUS AND WORK TO ENSURE MORE

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:06.868
INTENTIONAL, COMPREHENSIVE

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:07.702
APPROACH TO HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:10.171
MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE. AS AN

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:11.005
OVERARCHING MATTER, AS SEAB

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.640
URGES THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:14.842
BOARD, AS WELL AS PART OF ITS

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.110
WORK ON THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:17.745
MANAGEMENT PLAN AND WORK

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:20.948
OVERALL TO ENSURE RISK IS AT

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:23.050
THE FRONT AND CENTER AND ENSURE

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:25.019
THAT THAT DRIVES A GOOD PORTION

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:26.721
OF THE WORK IN THIS SPACE.

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.923
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED THAT THE

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.957
DIRECTOR AND SOME OF HER

01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:31.859
LEADERSHIP TEAM HAVE A GOOD

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:33.861
DEPTH OF UNDERSTANDING AND

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:35.196
EXPERTISE IN THIS. WE REALLY

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:36.798
THINK THEIR EPIDEMIOLOGY

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:37.999
BACKGROUNDS, WHAT HAVE YOU ARE

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:39.634
REALLY IMPORTANT TO THIS WORK

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.802
AND REALLY PROVIDING GREAT

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:44.305
VALUE AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:44.739
SIGNIFICANT FOCUS ON

01:30:44.806 --> 01:30:45.239
ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:46.941
STANDARDS THAT NO DOUBT YOU'VE

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:48.209
ALL HEARD ABOUT, CERTAINLY, THE

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:50.244
BOARD, THROUGH ITS PUBLIC

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.846
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS,

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:54.048
IMPORTANTLY SUPPORTED THE

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:55.149
CONCEPT OF ALTERNATIVE

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:57.585
MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN SB 158.

01:30:57.652 --> 01:31:00.221
THAT SAID, OUR INTENT WAS NOT

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:00.955
THAT IT BE CONFINED JUST TO

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:03.891
SOILS. HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.927
NOTED AS IT DOES RELATE TO

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:06.761
SOILS, THAT SOILS ARE

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:08.296
CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS, NOT

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:10.665
NECESSARILY JUST BECAUSE OF A

01:31:10.731 --> 01:31:12.900
RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S IMPACT ON

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:14.936
SOILS AT A PARTICULAR SITE.

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:16.704
THERE WERE ALSO SITUATIONS

01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:18.372
WHERE SOILS ARE DEEMED

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:20.608
HAZARDOUS BECAUSE OF NATURALLY

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:22.910
OCCURRING CONSTITUENTS. BUT

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:25.279
WHEN IT COMES TO HAZARDOUS

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:26.714
MANAGEMENT LAWS REQUIREMENTS,

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:29.083
ULTIMATELY ALL OF THOSE TYPES

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.985
OF SOILS ARE CONSIDERED THE

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:33.654
SAME. AND SO GIVEN THAT, YOU

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:35.823
KNOW, THAT WAS WHERE WE CAME

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:37.091
FROM, THINKING PERHAPS THERE

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:38.726
WAS VALUE IN TAKING A DEEPER

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.328
LOOK AT THAT. BUT SOILS

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:41.896
SPECIFICALLY ASIDE, SEEP

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:42.797
CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A BROADER

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:44.799
LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:47.101
STANDARDS, GENERALLY ACROSS ALL

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:49.971
TYPES OF WASTE. IN TERMS OF

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:52.340
HAZARDOUS WASTE CLASSIFICATION,

01:31:52.406 --> 01:31:52.940
ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF THE

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:55.443
PLAN. WHILE CIP APPRECIATES

01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:56.677
CALIFORNIA'S PREROGATIVE TO SET

01:31:56.744 --> 01:31:58.946
TOUGHER STANDARDS, ITS MEMBERS

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.615
HAVE HAD CONCERNS OVER MANY

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:03.084
YEARS WITH CERTAIN WASTES THAT

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:03.851
ARE CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS HERE

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:04.919
IN CALIFORNIA, BUT NOWHERE ELSE

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:07.922
IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS, FOR THAT

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.357
REASON, SUPPORTED PROVISIONS

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:11.692
WITHIN SB 158 THAT CALLED ON

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:14.028
DTSC TO REVIEW ITS

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:15.062
CLASSIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:18.032
WASTE, AND AS PART OF THAT, DC

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:18.799
SUBMITTED DETAILED COMMENTS ON

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:20.935
THIS, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF

01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:21.936
OTHER PIECES OF THE HAZARDOUS

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.671
WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN TO THE

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:24.872
DEPARTMENT AND THE BOARD.

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.941
REALLY, WITH THE FOCUS ON

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:27.942
PROPOSING TO ALIGN

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.911
CLASSIFICATION WITH THINGS THAT

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:31.679
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD

01:32:31.746 --> 01:32:33.814
IN PLACE FOR YEARS BASED ON

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:35.917
UPDATED SCIENCE TEST METHODS,

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:38.219
STANDARDS, AS WELL AS THAT THAT

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:39.854
HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY OTHER

01:32:39.921 --> 01:32:41.489
STATES. SO FOR THINGS LIKE THE

01:32:41.555 --> 01:32:42.957
AQUATIC TOXICITY TEST THAT THE

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:44.859
LEGISLATURE PUSHED DTSC VIA

01:32:44.926 --> 01:32:46.794
LEGISLATION TO UPDATE THEIR

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.329
OTHER STATES THAT ARE FURTHER

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.164
AHEAD OF US UNDERTAKING THAT

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:51.899
TYPE OF TOXICITY ASSESSMENT

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.535
WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF TESTS.

01:32:54.602 --> 01:32:55.036
WE THINK THERE COULD BE

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:55.803
EFFICIENCIES IN THAT RATHER

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.905
THAN HAVING DTSC REINVENT THE

01:32:57.972 --> 01:32:59.607
WHEEL, DO ALL OF ITS OWN

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:00.942
RESEARCH INSTEAD, EFFICIENCIES

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:03.644
IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD, BUT ALSO

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.813
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BY

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.682
LOOKING TO SOME OF THOSE OTHER

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:10.084
FEDERAL STANDARDS, TEST METHODS,

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:11.752
WHAT HAVE YOU AND THAT OF OTHER

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:13.154
STATES AS WELL, IN TERMS OF

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.722
PERMITTING TIMELINES AND

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:15.990
ACCOUNTABILITY, AS HE BELIEVES,

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:17.692
THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDEED MADE

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:18.826
SIGNIFICANT HEADWAY ON

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.861
PERMITTING AND BACKLOGGED

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.163
PERMITS, ALTHOUGH C DOES REMAIN

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.830
CONCERNED ABOUT ADDED

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:25.099
REGULATORY BURDEN, MULTILAYERED

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:27.668
AND INCREASING COSTS, AND

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:29.904
UNRELATED MITIGATION BURDENS

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:31.472
THAT COULD EXACERBATE A DECLINE

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:33.541
IN PERMITTED CAPACITY IN THE

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:35.609
STATE. FURTHER, AS DEPARTMENT

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:36.777
CONTINUES TO EMBARK ON ITS

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:38.179
EFFORTS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:40.781
SENATE BILL 673, THE TRACK TO

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:43.417
CUMULATIVE IMPACTS COMMUNITY

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:44.618
VULNERABILITY REGULATIONS THAT

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:46.887
IS LIKELY INEVITABLY TO RESULT

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:49.256
IN ADDED COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS,

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:50.758
REQUIREMENTS, AND IN TURN,

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:53.294
COSTS FOR THESE FACILITIES THAT

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:55.096
ARE ALREADY GRAPPLING WITH

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:56.831
REALLY ONGOING INCREASES IN

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.799
FEES ACROSS THE BOARD. SO WE

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:01.068
REALLY JUST ENCOURAGE THE

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:02.670
DEPARTMENT AS PART OF THAT WORK

01:34:02.737 --> 01:34:05.172
TO REALLY ENSURE RISK IS AT THE

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:06.040
FRONT AND CENTER WITH SCIENCE,

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:08.309
AND THAT DRIVES NOT ONLY THE

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:10.411
DETAILS OF THAT, BUT ALSO THE

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:11.679
RELEVANT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.748
EFFORTS, WHAT HAVE YOU.

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.049
SPEAKING OF MITIGATION, ON SITE

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:16.951
MITIGATION AND REMEDIATION, THE

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:18.152
REFORM PACKAGE PROVIDED A

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:19.954
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:21.889
OF THAT AND HAS BEEN SOME

01:34:21.956 --> 01:34:23.824
PROGRESS, ALTHOUGH MUCH WORK

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:25.760
REMAINS IN TERMS OF CLEANUP AND

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.795
REMEDIATION PROJECTS. ENSURING

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:29.597
CONSISTENCY. YOU KNOW, AS WITH

01:34:29.663 --> 01:34:30.998
ANY AGENCY, THERE'S CERTAINLY

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:32.066
STAFF TURNOVER WITH PROJECT

01:34:32.133 --> 01:34:33.768
MANAGERS, WHAT HAVE YOU, THAT

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:36.103
FOR MANY OF SEED MEMBERS WHO

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:36.804
ARE UNDERTAKING MITIGATION

01:34:36.871 --> 01:34:38.506
REMEDIATION PROJECTS, RESULTS

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:41.876
IN CONTINUED DELAYS AND COST

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:42.710
INCREASES, THAT REALLY DOES

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:45.112
HAVE AN IMPACT, NOT ONLY JUST

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:45.813
FOR THOSE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.715
IN THEIR CLEANUP EFFORTS, BUT

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:49.850
EVEN BEING ABLE TO TURN AROUND

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:51.652
THAT PROPERTY FOR OTHER HIGHER

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:52.920
USES, WHETHER THAT'S TO MEET

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:54.922
OUR HOUSING GOALS, WHAT HAVE

01:34:54.989 --> 01:34:58.025
YOU. SO CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT

01:34:58.092 --> 01:34:59.093
ISSUE TO DIVE INTO. MORE WORK

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.462
CAN BE DONE. SEE IS EVEN

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:02.930
RECOMMENDED LOOKING TO THINGS

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:05.066
LIKE THE NEW JERSEY LRP LICENSE

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:07.068
REMEDIATION PROFESSIONAL

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:08.836
PROGRAM TO HELP WITH CONCERNS

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:10.204
AND CHALLENGES AROUND STAFFING

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:12.073
AND HELP PROVIDE MORE

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:14.975
CONTINUITY OVER TIME. ON

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:15.910
NON-DUPLICATION, ANOTHER ISSUE

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:18.379
THAT WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF

01:35:18.446 --> 01:35:20.748
THE SB 158 REFORM WAS REALLY

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:22.983
ENSURING THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON

01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:23.684
AVOIDING DUPLICATION AND

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.820
OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:27.721
FOR PERMITTED FACILITIES ACROSS

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:29.790
MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND REALLY

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:32.593
ENSURING THAT THAT IS ALSO THE

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.795
CASE FOR VARIOUS FEE

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.864
REQUIREMENTS. MANY, IF NOT ALL,

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:39.066
OF OUR MEMBERS ARE STRADDLING

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:40.935
MULTIPLE AGENCIES FOR VERY

01:35:41.001 --> 01:35:41.602
SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS AND

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:43.838
REQUIREMENTS AND OVERSIGHT. AND

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.673
THAT DOES ADD ADDED COSTS. AND

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.808
WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY CLEAR

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:50.077
THAT THERE IS SPECIFIC BENEFIT

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:52.012
VERSUS JUST WORKING ON A

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.814
MULTIMEDIA APPROACH THAT ISN'T

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:55.950
ACTUALLY OVERLAPPING. AND THEN

01:35:56.016 --> 01:35:57.885
FINALLY KIND OF DIVING INTO THE

01:35:57.952 --> 01:35:58.752
TOPIC OF FEES, WHICH IS

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:00.688
CERTAINLY PROBABLY THE ONE OF

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:02.289
THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:04.658
OUR MEMBERS, WE AGREED TO THE

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:06.861
FEE REFORM IN SB 158,

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.028
RECOGNIZING THAT IT WAS

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:08.762
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR DTSC

01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:11.932
TO BE WELL FUNDED, NOT ONLY FOR

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:13.734
ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS AND

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:15.903
OBLIGATIONS, BUT ALSO TO ENSURE

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.872
THAT PERMITS WOULD BE, YOU KNOW,

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.073
KIND OF REVIEWED AND APPROVED

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.675
AND TIMELY FASHION, YOU KNOW,

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:23.010
OTHER TYPES OF OF EFFORTS THAT

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:25.179
THEY WORK WITH THE REGULATED

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:26.147
COMMUNITY ON. BUT THAT SAID,

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:27.915
YOU KNOW, WE DO HAVE ONGOING

01:36:27.982 --> 01:36:29.917
CONCERNS ABOUT FEE STRUCTURE AS

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.919
CONSTITUTED TODAY. WHILE WE'VE

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:33.921
BEEN WORKING WITH DTSC AND THE

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.856
BOARD ON THESE FEE SETTING THAT

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:37.424
WAS MENTIONED BY CHAIR

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:38.993
RAKESTRAW THAT THE BOARD WILL

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:39.760
BE UNDERTAKING HERE IN THE NEXT

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:42.830
WEEK OR SO FOR THE FEE SETTING

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:45.266
FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. WE DO

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:47.268
ANTICIPATE LARGELY STATUS QUO,

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:50.070
NOT INCREASES ACROSS THE FEE.

01:36:50.137 --> 01:36:50.905
SOME DECREASES, PERHAPS IN THE

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.973
FACILITY FEE AND ENVIRONMENTAL

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.775
FEE. AS WAS NOTED, THERE IS A

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:56.043
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WITH THE

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.646
GENERATION HANDLING FEE, WHICH

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:00.881
IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY

01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:01.715
CONCERNED ABOUT, AS WELL AS

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:04.084
PAIRED WITH MANY OF THE

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:04.818
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME

01:37:04.885 --> 01:37:06.153
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE OVER

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:08.088
THE LAST FEW YEARS RELATED TO

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:09.356
HOUSING, YOU KNOW, COSTS AND

01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:10.591
GENERATION, HANDLING FEES PAID

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:12.793
BY HOUSING ENTITIES AND EVEN

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:15.262
SOME ENERGY ENTITIES WHO ARE

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:16.730
ASKING FOR EXEMPTIONS THAT

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:18.599
ULTIMATELY SEE MEMBERS AND

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:19.633
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WOULD BE

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.769
HAVING TO SUBSIDIZE TO ENSURE

01:37:21.835 --> 01:37:24.805
DTSC IS WHOLE. AND IF YOU COULD

01:37:24.872 --> 01:37:28.042
PLEASE WRAP UP. GOT IT. SO I

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:29.777
THINK MAYBE WHERE I WILL JUST

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:31.946
LEAVE IT IS, YOU KNOW, THERE AS

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:33.614
YOU CAN APPRECIATE A LOT OF

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:35.916
THREADS TO PULL ON ISSUES

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:38.619
RELATED TO DTSC TO THE BOARD.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.988
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, CANDIDLY,

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:42.823
I THOUGHT I HAD A LITTLE BIT

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:43.724
MORE TIME, BUT NEVERTHELESS, I

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.059
THINK, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE WOULD

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:47.428
REALLY LIKE TO ENCOURAGE BOTH

01:37:47.494 --> 01:37:49.096
OF THE COMMITTEES AND CERTAINLY

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:50.331
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:51.799
DEPARTMENT, BOARD AND OTHER

01:37:51.865 --> 01:37:54.134
STAKEHOLDERS, IS TO CONSIDER,

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:55.102
PERHAPS OVER THE INTERIM TO

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:57.871
CONVENE A SERIES OF MEETINGS

01:37:57.938 --> 01:37:59.840
WITH STAKEHOLDERS, ALL

01:37:59.907 --> 01:38:01.642
STAKEHOLDERS, TO REALLY DIVE

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:03.911
MORE IN DEPTH ON SOME OF THESE

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:05.646
ISSUES, BECAUSE THERE IS SO

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:06.947
MUCH COMPLEXITY, SO MUCH DETAIL

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.849
THAT WE'RE BARELY ABLE TO

01:38:08.916 --> 01:38:11.151
SCRATCH THE SURFACE ON. BUT IN

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.019
THE NEAR TERM, WE'D LIKE TO

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:13.287
REALLY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:14.888
IN THE NEAR TERM, SPECIFICALLY

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:16.056
ON THE FEE SETTING SIDE OF

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:18.626
THINGS, AS THIS IS NOT A

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:20.060
SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURE, AND WE

01:38:20.127 --> 01:38:21.829
REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

01:38:21.895 --> 01:38:23.697
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER SOME

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:24.732
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT,

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.033
ESPECIALLY FOR THINGS LIKE THE

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.935
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:29.903
COMPONENTS AND OTHER ISSUES AND

01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:31.572
EFFORTS THAT HAVE KIND OF

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.807
BROADER STATE POLICY GOALS AND

01:38:33.874 --> 01:38:37.211
BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:38.212
SO WITH THAT, I'LL LEAVE IT

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:39.313
THERE. REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:45.219
TIME. GOOD MORNING, MADAM CHAIR.

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:46.854
MR. CHAIR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.856
FOR INVITING ME HERE TO DISCUSS

01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:50.658
DTSC. I'M ANGELA JOHNSON

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:52.126
MESZAROS. I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:54.295
IN THE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:56.063
PROGRAM AT OUR JUSTICE. OUR

01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:57.064
TEAM REPRESENTS FRONTLINE

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:58.932
COMMUNITY LEADERS DEMANDING

01:38:58.999 --> 01:39:00.734
SAFE, JUST AND HEALTHY

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:02.269
ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THEIR

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:02.936
COMMUNITIES CAN THRIVE. MY

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:04.838
APPEARANCE HERE TODAY IS NOT ON

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:07.041
BEHALF OF A CLIENT, BUT RATHER

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:08.909
AS AN INFORMED PARTICIPANT IN

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:10.811
THE WORK TO PUSH DTSC TO

01:39:10.878 --> 01:39:12.646
PROTECT PEOPLE AND THE

01:39:12.713 --> 01:39:13.747
ENVIRONMENT FROM UNJUSTIFIED

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:15.749
AND UNLAWFUL THREATS POSED BY

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:18.185
THE CREATION, USE, RECAPTURE

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:20.254
AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:21.588
SUBSTANCES. THE QUESTIONS AND

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:23.023
OBSERVATIONS OF THOSE MOST

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:25.959
IMPACTED BY A SITUATION ARE

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:26.694
GENERALLY THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.730
I INVITE YOU TO CONSIDER THESE

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:31.665
THREE. WOULD YOU TELL YOUR

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:33.000
CHILDREN YOU DON'T BREATHE?

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.535
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

01:39:34.601 --> 01:39:36.770
PROTECT YOU. ASK RICHARD CAMARA

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:39.606
AT A HEARING IN 2018 FOR A

01:39:39.673 --> 01:39:41.208
STILL DELAYED PERMIT DECISION

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.810
FOR FACILITY WITH A DECADES

01:39:42.876 --> 01:39:44.678
LONG HISTORY OF VIOLATING

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:46.914
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT LAWS.

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.782
MR. CAMARA PASSED AWAY THIS

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:52.353
YEAR. YET HIS WORDS AND HIS

01:39:52.419 --> 01:39:54.321
DEEDS STILL PUSH THIS WORK

01:39:54.388 --> 01:39:57.391
FORWARD. HOW CAN I JUSTIFY THIS

01:39:57.458 --> 01:40:00.861
TO MY FIREFIGHTER'S WIFE? WHAT

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:03.163
IF HE WOULD HAVE DIED? WONDERED

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:03.931
LIEUTENANT EDUARDO IBARRA,

01:40:03.997 --> 01:40:06.266
WHILE HE WAS REFLECTING ON THE

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.101
RISKS THAT HE AND HIS

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:09.370
FIREFIGHTERS FACED RESPONDING

01:40:09.436 --> 01:40:11.672
TO YET ANOTHER FIRE AT A SCRAP

01:40:11.739 --> 01:40:15.275
METAL RECYCLER, THE REGULATORS,

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:17.878
THEY BACKED DOWN. THAT'S REALLY

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:20.114
OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM, OBSERVED

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:23.217
REBECCA OVERMYER VELASQUEZ WHEN

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:24.184
REFLECTING ON HER ENGAGEMENT

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:25.919
WITH DTSC. DTSC HAS A UNIQUE

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:28.122
AND CRITICAL ROLE IN THE

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:29.556
LANDSCAPE OF PROTECTIONS OF

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:30.090
HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:32.059
BECAUSE ITS WORK IS CROSSMEDIA

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:34.695
AND CRADLE TO CRADLE TO GRAVE.

01:40:34.762 --> 01:40:35.963
DTSC, WHOSE MANDATE IS TO KEEP

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:38.031
ITS FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:39.199
CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:41.135
ELIMINATE HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:43.237
WHILE ENSURING NECESSARY SHORT

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:45.172
TERM PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE

01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:47.007
TO KEEP US SAFE. BUT IT FEELS

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.009
LIKE DTSC STILL HASN'T FOUND

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:50.677
ITS WAY. TODAY'S HEARING IS

01:40:50.744 --> 01:40:52.846
CALLED FOR IN SB 158, SO THAT

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:54.948
THIS BODY CAN HEAR ABOUT AND

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:56.717
CONSIDER THE PROGRESS DTSC HAS

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:57.951
MADE IN ADDRESSING LONG

01:40:58.018 --> 01:41:00.421
STANDING, CLEARLY IDENTIFIED

01:41:00.487 --> 01:41:00.954
CHALLENGES THAT THIS BILL

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:02.756
SOUGHT TO ADDRESS. AND WHILE

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:04.024
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT

01:41:04.091 --> 01:41:06.827
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED SINCE 2021,

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:09.530
I WILL SAY THAT THE CHALLENGES

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:10.831
OF YESTERDAY PERSIST. OR, AS MY

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:12.933
GRANDMOTHER MIGHT SAY, JUST

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:13.901
DOING ANYTHING ISN'T THE SAME

01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:16.904
THING AS DOING SOMETHING. DTSC,

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:18.672
IT SEEMS, HAS DOES NOT SHARE

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:20.774
OUR FEELING OF THE FIERCE

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:22.910
URGENCY OF NOW, A PHRASE THAT

01:41:22.976 --> 01:41:23.744
DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING USED

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:25.779
TO CALL FOR IMMEDIATE AND

01:41:25.846 --> 01:41:26.947
DECISIVE ACTION NEEDED TO

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:29.716
ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES IN THE

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:32.219
CONTEXT OF OUR CRITICAL ISSUES.

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.921
SB 5158 WAS A CULMINATING

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:35.956
LEGISLATIVE MOMENT IN A 15 YEAR

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:39.126
LONG EFFORT TO PUSH DTSC TO

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:40.928
RESPOND TO QUESTIONS AND

01:41:40.994 --> 01:41:41.795
OBSERVATIONS FROM PEOPLE WHO

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:43.931
NEED DTSC TO BE TIMELY,

01:41:43.997 --> 01:41:46.033
EFFECTIVE AND PROTECTIVE IN ITS

01:41:46.099 --> 01:41:48.969
WORK. IN 2013, A 2013 REPORT

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:50.971
TITLED PERMITTING, PROCESS,

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:51.872
REVIEW AND ANALYSIS IS

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:53.173
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DESCRIBED

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.741
MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

01:41:54.808 --> 01:41:56.777
ARE STILL GRAPPLING WITH TODAY.

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:58.645
FOR EXAMPLE, THAT REPORT FOUND

01:41:58.712 --> 01:41:59.913
THAT PERMITTING DECISIONS WERE

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:03.283
NOT MADE IN A TIMELY WAY. THEN

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:04.151
25% OF THE FACILITIES WERE

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:05.886
OPERATING WITH EXPIRED PERMITS.

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.921
THE REPORT RECOMMENDED

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.156
INCREASING PERMITTING STAFF TO

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:12.259
35 TO HANDLE THE WORKLOAD,

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:14.127
INCLUDING THE BACKLOG. NOW, THE

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:15.796
PERMITTING DIVISION HAS 73

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.965
POSITIONS, AND DTSC REPORTS

01:42:18.031 --> 01:42:19.867
THAT 20% OF THE FACILITIES ARE

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:21.034
STILL OPERATING ON EXPIRED

01:42:21.101 --> 01:42:23.904
PERMITS. THE FOUR MOST LONGEST

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:24.972
DELAYED PERMITS EXPIRED A

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:29.209
DECADE AGO 2015, BUT BEYOND

01:42:29.276 --> 01:42:33.881
2013, 2006 AND 1996, THESE LONG

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:35.115
DELAYED DECISIONS ARE NOT A

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:39.219
BACKLOG. THEY ARE INSTITUTIONAL

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:41.221
FAILURES AND DTSC IS STUCK. AND

01:42:41.288 --> 01:42:43.457
AS A RESULT, COMMUNITIES ARE

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:44.992
STUCK WITH THE FACILITIES THAT

01:42:45.058 --> 01:42:46.193
ENDANGER THEIR HEALTH AND

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.629
SAFETY. THIS IS URGENT. THE

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:49.830
ONGOING FAILURE TO ADOPT THE

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.832
REGULATIONS MANDATED BY SB 673

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:54.067
IS ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE SAME

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:55.836
KIND OF FAILURE. IN 2015, IN

01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:57.804
RESPONSE TO THE 2013 REPORT AND

01:42:57.871 --> 01:43:00.407
THE ONGOING EXIDE DISASTER, THE

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.976
LEGISLATURE REQUIRED DTSC TO

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:03.977
ADOPT PERMITTING REGULATIONS

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:06.747
AND REFORMS. DTSC DID SOME OF

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:09.950
WHAT SB 673 MANDATED, BUT NOT

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:12.152
THE PARTS THAT DIRECTLY PROTECT

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:13.921
PEOPLE FROM THE FACILITIES THAT

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:16.990
ARE TOO LAWLESS, TOO CLOSE OR

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:17.925
TOO DANGEROUS TO CONTINUE TO

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:21.361
IGNORE. HERE AGAIN, DTSC IS

01:43:21.428 --> 01:43:22.229
STUCK, AND AGAIN, COMMUNITIES

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:24.398
ARE STUCK WITH THESE FACILITIES.

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:26.767
THIS IS REALLY URGENT. SOME

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.101
ARGUE THAT IT'S CRITICAL TO

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:30.037
BALANCE THE BENEFITS OF

01:43:30.103 --> 01:43:30.704
PURPORTEDLY UNCERTAIN

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:32.039
PROTECTIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:34.675
AGAINST THE COSTS OF MANAGING

01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:37.344
HAZARDOUS WASTE. THAT, HOWEVER,

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:38.745
IS NOT RIGHT. FIRST, THERE'S

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:40.814
ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT THE

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:42.349
SUBSTANCES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:43.650
HERE ARE HAZARDOUS. BUT SECOND,

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.352
AND CRITICALLY, THE PROPER

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:46.987
BALANCE ISN'T THE COST OF

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:47.788
BUSINESSES OPERATING IN THE

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:49.823
STATE ON ONE SIDE AND

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.291
PROTECTIONS TO HEALTH IN THE

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:52.659
ENVIRONMENT ON THE OTHER.

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:54.328
RATHER, THE PROPER BALANCE IS

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:56.196
THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:58.031
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES VERSUS THE

01:43:58.098 --> 01:43:59.399
INEFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:02.002
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. EFFECTIVE

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:03.904
MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:06.340
MEANS AT A MINIMUM SOURCE.

01:44:06.406 --> 01:44:06.807
REDUCTION, PERMITTING

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:08.308
PROTECTIONS THAT ELIMINATE

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:09.977
EMISSIONS, AND CONSISTENT,

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:10.811
STRONG ENFORCEMENT THAT ENSURES

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:12.846
THAT OPERATORS TAKE PROTECTIVE

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:14.615
MAKE PROTECTIVE CHOICES BEFORE

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:17.184
THEY'RE CAUGHT. THIS IS HOW WE

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.919
ELIMINATE TRAGEDIES LIKE THAT.

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:21.188
THAT UNFOLDING AT EXIDE. THE

01:44:21.254 --> 01:44:22.789
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SPENT

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:24.658
NEARLY $1 BILLION ON THAT

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:26.994
CLEANUP. IT IS ABSORBED MASSIVE

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:27.694
INSTITUTIONAL BANDWIDTH AND

01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:29.863
RESOURCES AT DTSC, AND THE

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:31.832
HEALTH COST TO PEOPLE IN

01:44:31.898 --> 01:44:33.700
PROXIMITY TO THAT SITE ARE

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:34.868
INCALCULABLE. AND IT'S NOT

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:38.038
CLEAN. EVEN IF THE PROPER

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:38.705
BALANCE WERE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:40.941
COSTS VERSUS ECONOMIC COSTS,

01:44:41.008 --> 01:44:42.175
THE SCALE IS WILDLY OUT OF

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:44.478
BALANCE. INEFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT

01:44:44.544 --> 01:44:46.013
OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IS

01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:47.881
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE, BOTH

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:49.816
IN THE TERMS OF THE SUFFERING

01:44:49.883 --> 01:44:51.718
THAT IT CAUSES AND IN THE

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.854
DOLLARS IT TAKES TO ADDRESS IT.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.088
IMAGINE, JUST FOR A MOMENT, A

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:57.924
WORLD IN WHICH WE INVESTED $1

01:44:57.991 --> 01:44:59.026
BILLION TO ELIMINATE EMISSIONS

01:44:59.092 --> 01:44:59.760
OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES ON THE

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:02.262
FRONT END. THE REALITY IS THAT

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:03.130
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE

01:45:03.196 --> 01:45:05.065
PAYING FOR INEFFECTIVE

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:05.732
MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:07.367
SUBSTANCES WITH OUR DOLLARS AND

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:09.102
WITH OUR HEALTH, IN A NOD TO

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:10.937
REGULATED ENTITIES, I'LL NOTE

01:45:11.004 --> 01:45:12.939
THAT FEES ARE A CRITICAL TOOL,

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:13.907
BUT NEED NOT BE THE ONLY TOOL

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:16.076
TO PAY FOR THESE COSTS, BECAUSE

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:17.611
THE REGULATED ENTITIES MUST

01:45:17.678 --> 01:45:18.912
ACKNOWLEDGE THE OBLIGATION TO

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:20.914
SPEND THE MONEY NECESSARY TO

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:22.049
ELIMINATE EMISSIONS OF

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:24.084
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES INTO OUR

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:25.952
AIR, OUR WATER, OUR SOIL, AND

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:27.788
OUR BODIES. AND IN REALITY, WE

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:30.023
HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE

01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:31.658
NEED TO BE CONCERNED THAT DTSC

01:45:31.725 --> 01:45:32.726
IS REGULATIONS ARE TOO

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.928
PROTECTIVE OR TOO COSTLY. THE

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:36.763
REGULATED ENTITIES SHOULD NOT

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:37.998
BE FREE TO SIMPLY RID

01:45:38.065 --> 01:45:39.599
THEMSELVES OF COSTS THAT ARE

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:40.767
RIGHTFULLY THEIRS, AND WE

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:43.070
CANNOT CAP OUR INVESTMENT IN

01:45:43.136 --> 01:45:45.272
THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

01:45:45.338 --> 01:45:46.740
HAZARDOUS WASTE AT WHAT THE

01:45:46.807 --> 01:45:47.974
REGULATED COMMUNITIES ARE

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:50.043
WILLING TO PAY. SO THE

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.044
LEGISLATURE HAS A CRITICAL ROLE

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.979
IN BRINGING NEEDED CLARITY TO

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:55.849
DTSC URGENT WORK, COMPREHENSIVE,

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:57.050
CLEAR AND PROTECTIVE REGULATORY

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:58.719
STRUCTURES CREATE A BUSINESS

01:45:58.785 --> 01:45:59.953
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SAFE

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.055
OPERATORS HAVE CLARITY, UNSAFE

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:03.690
OPERATORS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE,

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:05.258
AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE

01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:06.626
ENVIRONMENT ARE PROTECTED. AND

01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:08.662
THIS IS THE WIN WIN WIN OUTCOME

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:10.931
THAT DTSC MUST STRIVE TO PURSUE.

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:13.734
BUT RIGHT NOW, DTSC IS NOT

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:15.068
LEADING US ON A PATH TO A

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:16.670
CIRCULAR ECONOMY. IT IS STUCK

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:19.172
IN A STATUS QUO OF RECURRING

01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:20.741
DISASTERS, AND WE DO NOT SHARE

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:21.942
THE DIRECTOR'S CONFIDENCE IN

01:46:22.008 --> 01:46:24.010
THE PATH THAT SET OUT IN THE

01:46:24.077 --> 01:46:25.645
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN.

01:46:25.712 --> 01:46:26.847
THE WAY FORWARD IS NOT AND

01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:28.982
CANNOT BE TO ANNUALLY TISK TISK

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:30.717
ABOUT DTSC ONGOING CHALLENGES,

01:46:30.784 --> 01:46:32.853
OR TO HOPE THAT A BOARD THAT

01:46:32.919 --> 01:46:34.688
LACKS OR FAILS TO USE THE

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:35.222
LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY WILL

01:46:35.288 --> 01:46:36.957
CHANGE THE STATUS QUO. AT DTSC.

01:46:37.023 --> 01:46:38.825
THE WORK THAT DTSC HOLDS IS

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:40.894
SIMPLY TOO CRITICAL AND IT'S

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:42.696
TOO URGENT. RATHER, NOW, FOUR

01:46:42.763 --> 01:46:44.865
YEARS AFTER THE ADOPTION OF SB

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.600
158, THE LEGISLATURE MUST

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:48.869
RETURN TO ITS FOCUS, ITS RETURN,

01:46:48.935 --> 01:46:50.904
ITS FOCUS TO THE CHALLENGES THE

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:52.706
DTSC CONTINUES TO FACE, AND TO

01:46:52.773 --> 01:46:53.974
USE THOSE TOOLS THAT UNIQUELY

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.809
BELONG TO THE LEGISLATIVE

01:46:55.876 --> 01:46:57.144
BRANCH TO RESHAPE AND REDIRECT

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:58.845
THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING AT

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.947
THE DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE TODAY,

01:47:01.014 --> 01:47:02.916
LIKE EVERY DAY, LEGISLATIVE

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:05.018
OVERSIGHT MATTERS, PERHAPS

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:06.753
THROUGH OVERSIGHT HEARINGS, THE

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.822
CREATION OF A JOINT LEGISLATIVE

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:09.823
COMMITTEE, OR BOTH MEMBERS OF

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:12.492
THIS BODY CAN FOCUS ON

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:14.027
DEVELOPING THE NEEDED SOLUTIONS

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:15.629
TO MOVE US BEYOND REHASHING

01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:18.031
DTSC IS LONG, TROUBLING HISTORY

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:20.000
OF CHALLENGES AND AND WORKING

01:47:20.066 --> 01:47:21.701
WITH FRONTLINE LEADERS, WE CAN

01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:23.436
CHART THE NEXT STEPS THAT WILL

01:47:23.503 --> 01:47:25.639
MOVE US FORWARD. I IMPLORE YOU

01:47:25.705 --> 01:47:27.774
TO TALK WITH PEOPLE IMPACTED BY

01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:29.609
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:32.412
CREATION, USE, RECAPTURE AND

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:32.879
DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:35.081
SUBSTANCES. GO TO THOSE PLACES.

01:47:35.148 --> 01:47:38.952
SEE THOSE FACES. HEAR THOSE

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:40.787
VOICES. LEAN INTO THE SOLUTIONS

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:42.989
THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST AT

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:46.159
STAKE ARE CALLING FOR. TAKE ON

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:47.394
THE COURAGEOUS ACT OF

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.130
LEADERSHIP. WORK WITH US TO

01:47:50.197 --> 01:47:51.965
BUILD THE INSTITUTION OR

01:47:52.032 --> 01:47:53.733
INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.102
TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:56.803
AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM

01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:59.272
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, AND TO

01:47:59.339 --> 01:48:01.174
RESTORE THAT LAND. LAND THAT'S

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:03.109
IMPACTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL

01:48:03.176 --> 01:48:05.846
CONTAMINATION. I CALL ON YOU TO

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:08.181
INCREASE THE TO EMBRACE THE

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:09.583
CHALLENGE OF ENSURING THAT DTSC

01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:11.852
CHANGES REAL PEOPLE'S LIVED

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:13.720
EXPERIENCES FOR THE BETTER,

01:48:13.787 --> 01:48:15.856
BECAUSE THIS IS URGENT. THANK

01:48:15.922 --> 01:48:18.725
YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU TO

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:21.862
BOTH OF YOU. I WILL TURN IT TO

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:23.029
MY COLLEAGUE, CHAIR CONNELLY,

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:26.032
FOR QUESTIONS. APPRECIATE THE

01:48:26.099 --> 01:48:27.667
TESTIMONY FROM BOTH OF YOU.

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:29.769
MISS KÃ², STARTING WITH YOU, A

01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:31.771
COUPLE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS.

01:48:31.838 --> 01:48:33.840
IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF YEARS

01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:36.376
SINCE DTSC BEGAN REFORMS ON ITS

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:39.112
PERMITTING PROCESSES. FROM YOUR

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:40.881
PERSPECTIVE, HAVE YOU SEEN

01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:43.917
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PERMIT

01:48:43.984 --> 01:48:45.151
PROCESS AND ARE THERE AREAS

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:46.119
THAT COULD USE FURTHER

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:48.321
IMPROVEMENT? I APPRECIATE THE

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:50.957
QUESTION. INDEED. SO I THINK

01:48:51.024 --> 01:48:51.725
FROM OUR MEMBER'S PERSPECTIVE,

01:48:51.791 --> 01:48:53.727
YES, IMPROVEMENTS, TO BE SURE.

01:48:53.793 --> 01:48:56.863
YOU'LL RECALL, SB 158 ALTERED

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:59.633
THE TIMELINES FOR BEGINNING THE

01:48:59.699 --> 01:49:01.868
PERMITTING PROCESS REALLY TO,

01:49:01.935 --> 01:49:03.336
FOR ONE, YOU KNOW, TRY TO

01:49:03.403 --> 01:49:04.771
ADDRESS BACKLOGS, BUT ALSO TO

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:06.940
TRY TO AVOID, YOU KNOW, KIND OF

01:49:07.007 --> 01:49:10.043
LONG CONTINUATIONS IN PERMITS.

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.912
AND SO WE HAVE SEEN KIND OF

01:49:11.978 --> 01:49:14.381
THAT PLAYING OUT EFFECTIVELY.

01:49:14.447 --> 01:49:17.550
ADDITIONALLY, I WILL SAY WE DO

01:49:17.617 --> 01:49:20.120
HAVE A FEW MEMBERS WITHIN C WHO

01:49:20.186 --> 01:49:21.021
ARE PERMITTED FACILITIES THAT

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.656
ARE GOING THROUGH PERMIT

01:49:22.722 --> 01:49:26.793
RENEWALS RIGHT NOW. AND ONE OF

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.862
THE THINGS I THINK THAT HAS

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:29.996
BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:30.797
FROM OUR MEMBERS AND SEEN

01:49:30.864 --> 01:49:32.632
OURSELVES THAT WE THINK HAS

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:34.868
BEEN REALLY EFFECTIVE IS IN

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:37.337
THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THESE

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:38.838
FACILITIES OPERATE. THE

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:40.507
DEPARTMENT HAS NOW STARTED

01:49:40.573 --> 01:49:43.176
BRINGING OTHER AGENCIES AND

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:45.879
DEPARTMENTS, ER DISTRICTS, YOU

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:47.881
KNOW, MAYBE CALRECYCLE, YOU

01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:50.083
KNOW, OHA, THE AIR BOARD, WHAT

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:51.952
HAVE YOU ALL TOGETHER FOR THOSE

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:53.219
TYPES OF COMMUNITY MEETINGS,

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:56.089
WHICH I THINK HAS REALLY BEEN

01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:57.123
BENEFICIAL HISTORICALLY. I

01:49:57.190 --> 01:50:00.393
THINK THERE'S BEEN CHALLENGES

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:02.562
AT COMMUNITY MEETINGS ON THESE

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:03.730
TYPES OF PERMIT FACILITY

01:50:03.797 --> 01:50:06.599
RENEWALS, WHERE IT'S JUST THE

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:07.767
DEPARTMENT TRYING TO SPEAK TO

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:10.503
THAT, THE FACILITY TRYING TO

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:11.237
SPEAK TO THOSE COMPONENTS WHERE

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:12.672
YOU HAVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:50:12.739 --> 01:50:14.908
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT VARIOUS

01:50:14.975 --> 01:50:17.277
ISSUES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:18.311
PURVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT, BUT

01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:20.180
THERE IS REALLY HISTORICALLY

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:21.681
ONLY JUST BEEN, WELL, THAT'S

01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:23.016
NOT OUR AUTHORITY. YOU NEED TO

01:50:23.083 --> 01:50:24.751
GO TALK TO SO AND SO, WHAT

01:50:24.818 --> 01:50:26.720
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THE

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:27.854
DEPARTMENTS BECOME REALLY GOOD

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:30.357
AT BRINGING OTHER AGENCIES AND

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:30.924
DEPARTMENTS TOGETHER SO THAT

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:32.926
THE COMMUNITY CAN HEAR FROM

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:34.694
THEM DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY,

01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:35.929
VERSUS JUST KICKING THE CAN

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:37.897
DOWN THE ROAD SAYING, YOU NEED

01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:38.965
TO GO TALK TO THE AIR DISTRICT

01:50:39.032 --> 01:50:40.800
ABOUT THIS. THAT'S THEIR JOB.

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:42.202
NOW THEY HAVE THE AIR DISTRICT

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:43.737
AT THESE MEETINGS, WHICH IS

01:50:43.803 --> 01:50:45.905
GETTING THE COMMUNITY REAL TIME

01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:47.107
FEEDBACK ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:48.842
AND HELPING TO ALSO IN THE

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:51.077
PROCESS, WE THINK, YOU KNOW, I

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:52.712
DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:53.947
COMMUNITIES, BUT WE THINK AND

01:50:54.014 --> 01:50:55.215
HOPE THAT THAT'S ALSO HELPING

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:56.950
TO EDUCATE ALL STAKEHOLDERS

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:59.152
ABOUT WHO HAS WHAT

01:50:59.219 --> 01:50:59.886
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT ASPECTS

01:50:59.953 --> 01:51:01.821
OF CONCERN IN AND AROUND

01:51:01.888 --> 01:51:04.290
FACILITIES THAT MAY NOT EVEN BE

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:05.725
THE FACILITIES OWN, YOU KNOW,

01:51:05.792 --> 01:51:06.826
KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY OR

01:51:06.893 --> 01:51:09.029
IMPACT, WHAT HAVE YOU. SO I

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:09.763
THINK THAT'S BEEN, FROM WHAT

01:51:09.829 --> 01:51:11.798
WE'VE HEARD, REALLY HELPFUL AND

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:12.966
I THINK CERTAINLY A GOOD

01:51:13.033 --> 01:51:14.701
PRACTICE TO CONTINUE ACROSS

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:16.836
THEIR PERMITTING ACTIVITIES IN

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:19.139
TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT

01:51:19.205 --> 01:51:20.774
I THINK COULD CONTINUE TO BE

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.909
IMPROVED. I THINK, YOU KNOW,

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:23.643
SOME OF THE TIMELINES,

01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:26.413
CERTAINLY, BUT ALSO THE COSTS

01:51:26.479 --> 01:51:29.082
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FOR A

01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.682
COUPLE OF THE PERMITTED

01:51:29.749 --> 01:51:31.151
FACILITIES THAT ARE GOING

01:51:31.217 --> 01:51:31.951
THROUGH THAT PROCESS. NOW,

01:51:32.018 --> 01:51:34.821
THEY'RE NOT ONLY PAYING FEES

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:36.256
FOR THE FACILITY FEE AS

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:37.891
REQUIRED UNDER THE NEW

01:51:37.957 --> 01:51:40.927
STRUCTURE, FEES UNDER 158, BUT

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:42.695
ALSO THE PERMITTING PROCESS

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:45.165
FEES, AS WELL AS THE COMPLIANCE

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:47.734
AND IMPLEMENTATION RELATED

01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:49.936
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. NOW,

01:51:50.003 --> 01:51:52.072
LET ME BE CLEAR SIB NOR ITS

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:52.972
MEMBERS ARE SUGGESTING THAT

01:51:53.039 --> 01:51:54.541
THEY SHOULDN'T BE PAYING THEIR

01:51:54.607 --> 01:51:56.910
FAIR SHARE OF THIS, BUT THOSE

01:51:56.976 --> 01:51:58.611
ADDITIONAL ADDED COSTS ARE

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:00.713
REALLY PUSHING THE LIMITS ON

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:02.882
WHAT THESE FACILITIES CAN BEAR.

01:52:02.949 --> 01:52:04.684
AND SO I THINK THERE IS VALUE

01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:06.853
IN TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:07.720
PROCESSES AND THOSE COSTS TO

01:52:07.787 --> 01:52:09.089
SEE ARE THERE EFFICIENCIES THAT

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:11.891
CAN BE GARNERED? ARE ALL OF THE

01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:13.026
DIFFERENT STEPS, REQUIREMENTS?

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:15.328
WHAT HAVE YOU REALLY CRITICAL

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:16.930
AND IMPORTANT FOR PROTECTING

01:52:16.996 --> 01:52:18.665
COMMUNITIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT?

01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:19.933
OR ARE THERE THINGS THAT

01:52:19.999 --> 01:52:21.101
PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, PERHAPS

01:52:21.167 --> 01:52:23.303
COULD BE RECONSIDERED THAT

01:52:23.369 --> 01:52:25.505
DON'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE TO

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:26.639
THOSE TYPES OF PROTECTIONS, BUT

01:52:26.706 --> 01:52:29.175
STILL CAN ENSURE THAT THAT

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:31.444
EXISTS AND STILL HAVE THAT DTSC

01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:33.079
OVERSIGHT AND ENGAGEMENT? YEAH.

01:52:33.146 --> 01:52:35.648
APPRECIATE THAT. TURNING TO THE

01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:37.951
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN,

01:52:38.017 --> 01:52:39.652
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE INVOLVED

01:52:39.719 --> 01:52:42.322
IN DISCUSSIONS KIND OF LEADING

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:46.759
UP TO AB ONE OR SB 158. DO YOU

01:52:46.826 --> 01:52:49.729
THINK DTSC IS ON THE RIGHT

01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:51.965
TRACK WITH THE PLAN? WHAT DO

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:53.800
YOU SEE THAT COULD BE ADDED

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:57.370
UPON OR IMPROVED WITH THAT? YES,

01:52:57.437 --> 01:52:59.739
I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK DTSC

01:52:59.806 --> 01:53:03.009
HAS A TOUGH JOB IN, YOU KNOW,

01:53:03.076 --> 01:53:04.777
PUTTING THIS PLAN TOGETHER. SB

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:06.579
158 CALLED FOR A NUMBER OF

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:08.948
DIFFERENT PIECES IN TERMS OF,

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:10.917
YOU KNOW, WHAT THE PLAN WOULD

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:12.719
ENTAIL. AND THOSE AREN'T SMALL,

01:53:12.785 --> 01:53:15.822
YOU KNOW, EASY THREADS TO PULL

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:17.824
OR SOLUTIONS TO BE FOUND. SO I

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:20.093
THINK IT IS A SERIOUS CHALLENGE.

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:22.795
I THINK THEY HAVE HAVE DONE A

01:53:22.862 --> 01:53:24.164
GOOD JOB OF PUTTING FORWARD,

01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:26.099
YOU KNOW, KIND OF A FIRST, YOU

01:53:26.166 --> 01:53:29.235
KNOW, DRAFT THAT CERTAINLY KIND

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:30.837
OF GIVES SOME INSIGHT INTO

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:32.071
WHERE THEY THINK PERHAPS THEY

01:53:32.138 --> 01:53:34.841
CAN MAKE SOME PROGRESS. SO I

01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:35.942
THINK THAT IS GOOD. I THINK

01:53:36.009 --> 01:53:37.577
THERE WILL BE MORE WORK NEEDING

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:39.746
TO BE DONE, MORE DETAILS ABOUT

01:53:39.812 --> 01:53:41.581
HOW YOU ROLL OUT SOME OF THESE

01:53:41.648 --> 01:53:43.183
COMPONENTS AND PIECES OF THAT,

01:53:43.249 --> 01:53:44.951
AND OTHER THINGS THAT PERHAPS

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:46.019
ARE JUST GOING TO TAKE MORE

01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:47.720
TIME TO REALLY DIG INTO IN

01:53:47.787 --> 01:53:49.889
TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, EDUCATING

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:51.257
ALL STAKEHOLDERS BETTER,

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:51.658
UNDERSTANDING WHAT

01:53:51.724 --> 01:53:53.760
OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE, WHAT

01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:55.695
LIMITS THERE ARE TO WHAT PEOPLE

01:53:55.762 --> 01:53:57.797
ARE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN. AND

01:53:57.864 --> 01:53:59.098
THEN ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT,

01:53:59.165 --> 01:54:01.768
AGAIN, I THINK JUST GOING BACK

01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:03.203
TO MY COMMENTS ABOUT FUNDING,

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:04.904
MANY OF THE PIECES OF THAT

01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:05.838
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

01:54:05.905 --> 01:54:08.975
DO HAVE BROAD IMPLICATIONS FROM

01:54:09.042 --> 01:54:10.743
A STATE POLICY PERSPECTIVE, AS

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:13.947
WELL AS BENEFITS ACROSS VARIOUS

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:16.816
STAKEHOLDERS, SECTORS, STATE

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:18.651
AGENCIES, WHAT HAVE YOU. AND SO

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:19.852
WE'D REALLY ENCOURAGE, AGAIN,

01:54:19.919 --> 01:54:22.255
ONGOING CONSIDERATION OF NOT

01:54:22.322 --> 01:54:23.756
JUST CONTINUALLY INCREASING THE

01:54:23.823 --> 01:54:26.693
FEES ON REGULATED FEE PAYERS TO

01:54:26.759 --> 01:54:28.928
FUND ALL OF THAT WORK, WHICH IS

01:54:28.995 --> 01:54:30.930
INCREDIBLY SUBSTANTIAL, WILL

01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:32.665
TAKE MANY, MANY YEARS TO

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:33.833
COMPLETE. EVEN WHAT'S IN THAT

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:35.935
PLAN, MUCH LESS ANYTHING THAT'S

01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:37.170
NOT SO. WE REALLY THINK WE NEED

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:38.738
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:40.173
SOME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.809
THAT, RECOGNIZING WE DO HAVE

01:54:42.875 --> 01:54:43.977
SOME FISCAL ISSUES AT THE STATE

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:45.211
LEVEL. WE THINK ADDITIONAL

01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:46.779
FUNDING OUTSIDE OF FEE PAYERS

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:48.081
IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR

01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:50.650
THAT. BUT CERTAINLY SEAB DOES

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:53.086
ABSOLUTELY COMMIT TO BEING

01:54:53.152 --> 01:54:54.220
ENGAGED AND BEING SOLUTIONS

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:57.924
ORIENTED ON THAT GOING FORWARD.

01:54:57.991 --> 01:54:59.659
GREAT. AND JUST A COUPLE

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:03.162
QUESTIONS. AS MASSARO'S, DO YOU

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:05.164
HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON STEPS

01:55:05.231 --> 01:55:07.367
THE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE TO

01:55:07.433 --> 01:55:11.504
HELP DTSC PROGRAMS? I THINK YOU

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:13.806
WERE TÃNH THAT ISSUE UP AND

01:55:13.873 --> 01:55:16.209
THOUGHT WE'D GIVE YOU THAT

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:17.577
OPPORTUNITY. TEEING IT UP. ME

01:55:17.644 --> 01:55:21.948
KNOW? YEAH. SO AS I WAS

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:23.049
THINKING ABOUT TODAY'S

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:23.916
CONVERSATION, I THINK THAT

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:26.552
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:28.788
EQUALLY TRUE. FIRST, THERE ARE

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:30.089
LOTS OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

01:55:30.156 --> 01:55:32.759
ADDRESSED AT DTSC IN THE

01:55:32.825 --> 01:55:34.460
LEGISLATURE. DEFINITELY HOLDS

01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:36.029
AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. AND

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:37.930
THERE'S SO MUCH STILL TO DIG

01:55:37.997 --> 01:55:40.333
INTO AND UNDERSTAND BEFORE WE

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:40.967
CAN DEVELOP THOSE SOLUTIONS. SO

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:42.869
HERE'S WHAT I REALLY THINK

01:55:42.935 --> 01:55:44.971
NEEDS TO HAPPEN. I THINK THAT

01:55:45.038 --> 01:55:47.040
DTSC IS NOT MAKING THE STRIDES

01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:49.008
THAT IT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN

01:55:49.075 --> 01:55:51.244
ORDER TO GET US WHERE WE NEED

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:52.745
TO GO. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.747
TO SPEND SOME FOCUSED TIME

01:55:54.814 --> 01:55:55.948
REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT

01:55:56.015 --> 01:55:59.118
COMES NEXT. DTSC IS STUCK IN A

01:55:59.185 --> 01:56:01.421
RUT, AND WHERE THE LEGISLATURE,

01:56:01.487 --> 01:56:03.890
I THINK IS REALLY EFFECTIVE IS

01:56:03.956 --> 01:56:05.958
MAKING POLICY DECISIONS THAT

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:07.694
END UP IN AGENCIES BEING STUCK

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.897
IN RUTS. SO WHAT WE SEE IN THE

01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:11.931
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN,

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:14.334
FOR EXAMPLE, IS A FUNDAMENTAL

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:15.034
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE QUESTION

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:18.838
OF SHOULD WE USE SHOULD WE STEP

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:20.506
AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA'S

01:56:20.573 --> 01:56:22.842
LEADERSHIP IN HAZARDOUS

01:56:22.909 --> 01:56:24.610
SUBSTANCES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE

01:56:24.677 --> 01:56:27.180
COST OR SPEED THINGS UP OR SOME

01:56:27.246 --> 01:56:29.082
SUCH THINGS? OR SHOULD WE LEAN

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:32.885
INTO OUR OUR LEADERSHIP,

01:56:32.952 --> 01:56:33.920
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MATCHING WITH

01:56:33.986 --> 01:56:36.255
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT A

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:37.990
GOOD CHOICE? IT PROBABLY NEVER

01:56:38.057 --> 01:56:40.793
WAS. IT CERTAINLY ISN'T NOW.

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.895
AND SHOULD WE, INSTEAD OF GOING

01:56:42.962 --> 01:56:45.832
ON A ON A PATH OF DEREGULATING

01:56:45.898 --> 01:56:46.999
HAZARDOUS WASTE, SHOULD WE

01:56:47.066 --> 01:56:49.168
REALLY JUST DRAW A LINE IN THE

01:56:49.235 --> 01:56:52.271
SAND AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO

01:56:52.338 --> 01:56:52.972
PRIORITIZE THE ELIMINATION OF

01:56:53.039 --> 01:56:54.974
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, WE'RE

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:56.576
GOING TO FIGURE OUT THE

01:56:56.642 --> 01:56:59.178
STRUCTURES AND THE PAYMENTS

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:00.012
THAT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN, AND

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:03.750
THEN MAKE THAT DTSC VERY CLEAR

01:57:03.816 --> 01:57:05.184
MANDATE. SO WE'RE THE

01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:07.854
LEGISLATURE IS IMPORTANT IS IN

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.356
WEIGHING AND LAYING OUT THOSE

01:57:10.423 --> 01:57:11.824
POLICY CHOICES. AND I REALLY

01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:12.959
THINK THAT PART OF WHAT'S

01:57:13.025 --> 01:57:15.695
HAPPENING HERE IS THIS TENSION

01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:19.065
ABOUT THE COST AND THE BENEFITS

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:22.935
HAS TILTED TOO FAR TOWARD COST,

01:57:23.002 --> 01:57:25.071
IN PART BECAUSE GRAPPLING WITH

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:28.641
THE BENEFITS IS A CAN FEEL

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:29.909
COMPLICATED. BUT AS THE DOLLARS

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:33.780
STACK UP IN OUR CHASE TO THEN

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:35.681
FIX THINGS THAT HAVE GONE WRONG

01:57:35.748 --> 01:57:36.749
BECAUSE WE MADE THE

01:57:36.816 --> 01:57:38.785
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG CHOICE,

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:41.487
THEN WE CAN SEE THAT THE COST,

01:57:41.554 --> 01:57:43.923
WHAT WE'RE SAVING IS NOT MONEY,

01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:46.692
AND WHAT WE'RE GIVING UP ARE

01:57:46.759 --> 01:57:48.828
PEOPLE'S LIVES, THEIR QUALITY

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:50.797
OF LIFE, AND THE FEELING THAT

01:57:50.863 --> 01:57:51.998
THEIR GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIVE

01:57:52.064 --> 01:57:53.966
TO THEIR QUESTIONS AND THEIR

01:57:54.033 --> 01:57:55.601
NEEDS. AND THOSE THREE THINGS

01:57:55.668 --> 01:58:00.106
ARE IMPORTANT. THANKS. OKAY.

01:58:00.173 --> 01:58:02.074
THANK YOU. WELL, WE APPRECIATE

01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:03.643
BOTH OF YOUR TESTIMONY. AND WE

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:06.412
HAVE A THIRD PANEL. SO WE'RE

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:07.013
GOING TO MOVE ON TO THAT NOW.

01:58:07.079 --> 01:58:09.715
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

01:58:09.782 --> 01:58:11.918
SO OUR THIRD PANEL IS

01:58:11.984 --> 01:58:13.152
PERSPECTIVES ON SOURCE

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:15.154
REDUCTION AND TOXICS IN

01:58:15.221 --> 01:58:18.057
CONSUMER PRODUCTS. AND WE WILL

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:21.594
WELCOME FORWARD AVANEESH KHARE

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:28.034
NICOLE. QUINONES QUINONES AND

01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.736
IVANA CASTELLANOS. AND YOU'RE

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:32.638
WELCOME TO SIT DOWN AND BEGIN

01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:36.776
WHEN READY. AND YOU EACH HAVE

01:58:36.843 --> 01:58:44.350
SEVEN MINUTES. THANK YOU. I

01:58:44.417 --> 01:58:46.853
THOUGHT I WAS GOING LAST. OH I

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:50.690
THOUGHT YOU WERE. YOU WANT ME

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:54.727
TO GO FIRST? ALL RIGHT. GOOD

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:56.028
MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE

01:58:56.095 --> 01:58:57.663
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY

01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:58.898
NAME IS AVI. I'M A SENIOR

01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:00.466
ATTORNEY AND SENIOR DIRECTOR

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:01.801
FOR TOXICS AT THE NATURAL

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:05.137
RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, NRDC.

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:07.673
WE'RE FACING AN ONSLAUGHT OF

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:08.975
EXPOSURES TO HARMFUL CHEMICALS.

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:11.110
AND THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

01:59:11.177 --> 01:59:12.311
PROGRAM HAS A CRITICAL ROLE TO

01:59:12.378 --> 01:59:14.514
PLAY IN PROTECTING PUBLIC

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.782
HEALTH FROM BY REDUCING THE USE

01:59:16.849 --> 01:59:18.818
AND RELEASE OF HARMFUL

01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:20.052
CHEMICALS TO REDUCE BOTH

01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:22.154
EXPOSURES AND CLEAN UP BURDENS

01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:24.023
AS WE GO FORWARD. ONE OF THE

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:25.324
BEST WAYS TO ADDRESS HARMFUL

01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:26.926
CHEMICALS IS TO NOT HAVE THEM

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.594
OUT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:30.730
AND THAT'S EXACTLY SCP'S REMIT.

01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:32.932
WHILE THE PROGRAM HAS MADE SOME

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:33.766
IMPORTANT PROGRESS ON THAT

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:36.402
FRONT, IT HAS NOT MADE NEARLY

01:59:36.469 --> 01:59:37.670
ENOUGH PROGRESS. THE PROGRAM

01:59:37.737 --> 01:59:38.838
NEEDS TO DO A LOT MORE TO

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:40.907
DELIVER ON PUBLIC HEALTH. PART

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:42.942
OF ITS PREMISE, PART OF THE

01:59:43.009 --> 01:59:43.776
PROMISE OF THE PROGRAM, WAS

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:44.977
THAT IT WOULD SWIFTLY AND

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.112
EFFICIENTLY DEAL WITH HARMFUL

01:59:46.178 --> 01:59:47.780
CHEMICALS, BUT THAT HASN'T

01:59:47.847 --> 01:59:50.449
REALLY COME TO PASS. THEY HAVE

01:59:50.516 --> 01:59:50.983
LARGELY BEEN VERY SLOW AND

01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.784
INEFFICIENT, AND WE'D LIKE TO

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:54.120
SEE THAT IMPROVE AS WE GO

01:59:54.186 --> 01:59:56.522
FORWARD. WHILE THE PROGRAM HAS

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:58.124
BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING

01:59:58.190 --> 01:59:58.824
AND ENLISTING PROBLEMATIC

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.960
CHEMICALS, IT HAS HAD A LOT

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:01.761
LESS SUCCESS AT REDUCING THE

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:04.096
USE OF THOSE PROBLEMATIC

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:06.766
CHEMICALS, AT LEAST TO DATE.

02:00:06.832 --> 02:00:08.935
I'LL START WITH THE SUCCESSES.

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:10.703
THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT STAFF AT

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:11.938
THE PROGRAM, AND THEY HAVE HAD

02:00:12.004 --> 02:00:14.774
A LOT OF SUCCESS IN CREATION OF

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.276
THE CHEMICALS LIST AND WORK TO

02:00:17.343 --> 02:00:18.311
DEVELOP THE SCIENTIFIC APPROACH

02:00:18.377 --> 02:00:19.845
TO ADDRESSING CLASS OF TOXIC

02:00:19.912 --> 02:00:22.014
PFAS CHEMICALS, AND THE RECENT

02:00:22.081 --> 02:00:23.583
PROPOSAL TO LIST MICROPLASTICS.

02:00:23.649 --> 02:00:26.786
THESE ARE UBIQUITOUS POLLUTANTS

02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:28.821
THAT SCP HAS BEEN BOLD ENOUGH

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:30.356
TO TAKE ON THAT REQUIRES

02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:30.890
SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE, AND

02:00:30.957 --> 02:00:32.358
THEY'VE ADDRESSED THE

02:00:32.425 --> 02:00:34.360
SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS IN A

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:34.827
THOUGHTFUL WAY. THESE

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:36.729
DEMONSTRATE A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:38.030
MINDSET AND A WILLINGNESS TO

02:00:38.097 --> 02:00:40.766
FOCUS EXPERTISE ON CUTTING EDGE

02:00:40.833 --> 02:00:41.901
PROBLEMS AND SHOWCASE THE

02:00:41.968 --> 02:00:44.904
PROGRAM'S POTENTIAL. THAT SAID,

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:46.839
IN THE 15 YEARS SINCE ITS

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:48.941
INCEPTION, THE PROGRAM HAS A

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:50.142
WORRYINGLY SMALL TRACK RECORD

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:52.878
ON REDUCING USE. THE

02:00:52.945 --> 02:00:53.746
ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS PROCESS

02:00:53.813 --> 02:00:56.782
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SLOW. BY MY

02:00:56.849 --> 02:00:58.050
COUNT, THEY HAVE ONLY COMPLETED

02:00:58.117 --> 02:00:59.185
EIGHT PRODUCT CHEMICAL

02:00:59.251 --> 02:01:00.786
COMBINATIONS, AND NOT ALL OF

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:03.623
THEM HAVE BEEN FINALIZED TO

02:01:03.689 --> 02:01:05.992
REGULATORY ACTION. ONLY SIX

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:07.893
MORE CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS ARE

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.261
IN THE LATER STAGES OF BEING

02:01:09.328 --> 02:01:11.230
LISTED, SEVERAL OF WHICH

02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:13.265
ARGUABLY ARE ADD ONS TO

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:15.968
COMPLETED ADOPTIONS AND COULD

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:19.772
HAVE BEEN COMBINED INTO INTO

02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:21.574
EARLIER PROCESSES RATHER THAN

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:23.676
BEING DRAGGED OUT INTO SEPARATE

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:26.579
PROCESSES. EVEN FOR THE

02:01:26.646 --> 02:01:27.146
FINALIZED PRODUCT. CHEMICAL

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:28.814
COMBINATIONS. THE PROGRAM'S

02:01:28.881 --> 02:01:30.049
ACTIONS HAVE OFTEN BEEN

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:32.752
NARROWER THAN WARRANTED. FOR

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:34.387
EXAMPLE ON SPRAY FOAM

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:36.255
INSULATION, EVEN THOUGH THERE

02:01:36.322 --> 02:01:37.857
ARE NUMEROUS COST EFFECTIVE AND

02:01:37.923 --> 02:01:40.026
EVEN CHEAPER INSULATION

02:01:40.092 --> 02:01:41.794
ALTERNATIVES TO SPRAY FOAM

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:43.295
AVAILABLE THAT WORK JUST AS

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:44.730
WELL OR BETTER. THE PROGRAM

02:01:44.797 --> 02:01:47.400
FAILED TO END THE USE OF THESE

02:01:47.466 --> 02:01:49.135
HARMFUL PRODUCTS WHERE IT COULD,

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:50.770
AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON REQUIRING

02:01:50.836 --> 02:01:51.971
CONTRIBUTIONS TO A RESEARCH

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:53.706
FUND. THE AMOUNTS ADDED UP TO

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:55.241
AN INCONVENIENCE FOR THE

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:56.942
COMPANIES INVOLVED, GIVEN THE

02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:59.378
RESOURCES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:01.047
DONE BETTER. AND ANOTHER

02:02:01.113 --> 02:02:02.214
EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING

02:02:02.281 --> 02:02:03.883
MULTIPLE PROBLEMATIC CHEMICALS

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:06.085
IN THE PRODUCT AT THE SAME TIME,

02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:07.820
THE PROGRAM HAS OFTEN SPREAD

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:09.989
THAT WORK OUT. SO WE SAW ACTION

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:10.823
ON METHYLENE CHLORIDE IN PAINT

02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:12.758
STRIPPERS, AND NOW WE'RE SEEING

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:14.593
ACTION ON N-METHYLPYRROLIDONE

02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:17.363
IN A SEPARATE PROCESS ON PAINT

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:19.365
STRIPPERS. THESE GIVE THE

02:02:19.432 --> 02:02:20.700
ILLUSION OF MORE ACTIVITY THAN

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:23.869
THERE REALLY HAS BEEN AT TIMES.

02:02:23.936 --> 02:02:24.870
SO AND THERE ARE SOME TOOLS

02:02:24.937 --> 02:02:26.806
AVAILABLE TO THE AGENCY THAT IT

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:30.342
CAN HOPEFULLY USE TO SPEED UP

02:02:30.409 --> 02:02:32.178
THINGS. THERE WAS REFERENCE

02:02:32.244 --> 02:02:34.714
MADE TO SB 502 EARLIER, AND

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.849
THAT PASSED IN 2022, WITH THE

02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:38.417
GOAL OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:39.018
STRUCTURAL ROADBLOCKS THAT WE

02:02:39.085 --> 02:02:41.053
SEE FOR THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.788
PRODUCTS PROGRAM. THIS THESE

02:02:42.855 --> 02:02:44.857
ROADBLOCKS WERE IDENTIFIED ON A

02:02:44.924 --> 02:02:46.559
REPORT ON THE PROGRAM'S 10TH

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:47.660
ANNIVERSARY. AND TO ADDRESS THE

02:02:47.727 --> 02:02:50.329
ROADBLOCKS, SB 502 PROVIDED

02:02:50.396 --> 02:02:52.898
CLEAR AUTHORITY TO GET DATA ON

02:02:52.965 --> 02:02:54.333
PRODUCTS FROM MANUFACTURERS,

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:55.868
AND IT CREATED AN EXPEDITED

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:57.837
ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY FOR TIME

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:59.839
CONSUMING ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS.

02:02:59.905 --> 02:03:01.640
WHEN STUDIES OF ALTERNATIVES

02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:04.610
ALREADY EXIST, WE THINK THESE

02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:06.746
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SPEED UP

02:03:06.812 --> 02:03:08.981
THE WORK AT THE AGENCY.

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:10.649
UNFORTUNATELY, THE AGENCY HAS

02:03:10.716 --> 02:03:12.752
BEEN VERY SLOW TO GET OUT OF

02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:14.754
THE BLOCKS. REGULATIONS TO

02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:16.822
IMPLEMENT SB 502 HAVE ONLY JUST

02:03:16.889 --> 02:03:18.357
BEEN PROPOSED THIS YEAR, THREE

02:03:18.424 --> 02:03:20.760
YEARS AFTER THE LAW PASSED.

02:03:20.826 --> 02:03:22.561
WE'RE EAGER TO SEE WHETHER AND

02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:24.730
HOW THE PROGRAM WILL USE THE

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:25.898
AUTHORITIES IN SB 502 TO SPEED

02:03:25.965 --> 02:03:28.901
UP ACTION, BUT IT HAS BEEN VERY

02:03:28.968 --> 02:03:31.370
SLOW. WE ALL SEE THE POTENTIAL

02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:33.339
OF THE PROGRAM. THAT'S WHY WE

02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:35.908
WORKED WITH PEOPLE LIKE MISS

02:03:35.975 --> 02:03:38.778
QUINONEZ TO PASS SB 502 AND

02:03:38.844 --> 02:03:40.613
ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM,

02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:43.015
BUT THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO START

02:03:43.082 --> 02:03:45.184
DELIVERING MORE FASTER TO

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:46.752
DELIVER ON ITS PROMISE. WE

02:03:46.819 --> 02:03:48.020
THINK THE PROGRAM SHOULD

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:49.088
EXPLORE WHETHER THERE ARE

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:50.222
OPPORTUNITIES TO STREAMLINE AND

02:03:50.289 --> 02:03:52.725
SPEED UP ACTION AND IMPROVE ITS

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:54.960
RESULTS BY BOTH MODIFYING ITS

02:03:55.027 --> 02:03:56.061
EXISTING REGULATIONS AND ITS

02:03:56.128 --> 02:03:58.597
PROCESSES. SOMETIMES THERE'S AN

02:03:58.664 --> 02:03:59.698
INORDINATE AMOUNT OF PROCESS

02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:02.334
WHERE YOU GET A DRAFT AND THEN

02:04:02.401 --> 02:04:04.003
ANOTHER DRAFT AND THEN A

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:06.372
PROPOSAL AND SO FORTH, AND

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:07.840
THINGS DRAG ON. SECONDLY, WE

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:09.675
THINK THE PROGRAM SHOULD ALSO

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:10.976
MOVE MORE QUICKLY TO LEVERAGE

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:12.211
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:13.813
IMPROVEMENTS IN SB 502. AND I

02:04:13.879 --> 02:04:16.081
ALSO WANT TO REFER TO SOMETHING

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:19.218
THAT THE CHAIR SAID EARLIER

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:20.986
ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACTS AND

02:04:21.053 --> 02:04:22.421
THE WAY THE AGENCY ADDRESSES

02:04:22.488 --> 02:04:24.156
THOSE. I THINK THERE'S AN

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:26.659
OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER SEE THE

02:04:26.725 --> 02:04:28.928
BENEFITS THAT COULD COME FROM

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:30.930
THE THE EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING

02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:33.299
PUT FORWARD IN POLICY AND NOT

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:36.035
LOSE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES.

02:04:36.101 --> 02:04:37.870
IN THE MEANTIME, I ALSO THINK

02:04:37.937 --> 02:04:39.071
THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:41.841
HAVE A KEY ROLE TO PLAY FIRST,

02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:43.075
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WHEN THE

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:45.711
SCIENCE AND CHEMICALS AND ON

02:04:45.778 --> 02:04:48.247
ALTERNATIVES IS CLEAR, THE

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:50.149
LEGISLATURE CAN CONTINUE TO ACT,

02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:51.917
ALLOWING THE PROGRAMS LIMITED

02:04:51.984 --> 02:04:53.819
RESOURCES TO BE BEST FOCUSED ON

02:04:53.886 --> 02:04:55.754
ISSUES THAT CAN BENEFIT THE

02:04:55.821 --> 02:04:57.122
MOST FROM THE AGENCY'S

02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:58.724
SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE. AN

02:04:58.791 --> 02:05:00.559
EXAMPLE IS A BILL THAT WE ARE

02:05:00.626 --> 02:05:01.727
SPONSORING AND THAT IS

02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:03.262
CURRENTLY BEFORE THE

02:05:03.329 --> 02:05:03.863
LEGISLATURE, WHICH IS SB 682,

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:06.232
WHICH WOULD PHASE OUT

02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:06.765
UNNECESSARY USES OF PFAS

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:10.202
FOREVER CHEMICALS IN SIX

02:05:10.269 --> 02:05:10.769
CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS WHICH

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.371
HAVE ALREADY BEEN PHASED OUT IN

02:05:12.438 --> 02:05:14.874
OTHER STATES, AND WHICH WHERE

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:16.308
DTSC HAS ALREADY ARTICULATED

02:05:16.375 --> 02:05:18.844
THE NEED TO REGULATE PFAS AS A

02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:21.814
CLASS A SECOND POSSIBLE AREA

02:05:21.881 --> 02:05:24.049
FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IS THE

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:24.884
PROGRAM HAS NEW ENFORCEMENT

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:27.052
AUTHORITIES UNDER AB 347, WHICH

02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:31.891
PASSED LAST YEAR. THIS ALLOWS

02:05:31.957 --> 02:05:33.125
THE AGENCY TO ENFORCE LAWS

02:05:33.192 --> 02:05:34.894
PHASING OUT PFAS IN VARIOUS

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.295
PRODUCT CATEGORIES, BUT IT'S

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:39.031
AWAITING APPROPRIATIONS TO GET

02:05:39.098 --> 02:05:39.765
THAT ENFORCEMENT AND THAT

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:40.900
IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS MOVING

02:05:40.966 --> 02:05:45.638
ALONG. THE LEGISLATOR, SORRY,

02:05:45.704 --> 02:05:47.773
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACT TO

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:49.508
FUND AB 347 SO THAT THE PROGRAM

02:05:49.575 --> 02:05:50.242
CAN FULFILL ITS LEGISLATIVE

02:05:50.309 --> 02:05:53.846
MANDATE. AB 347 ALSO SETS UP AN

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:54.847
ENFORCEMENT STRUCTURE THAT

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:56.782
OTHER LAWS, FUTURE LAWS, CAN

02:05:56.849 --> 02:05:58.851
LEVERAGE. IT'S A WORTHWHILE

02:05:58.918 --> 02:05:59.985
INVESTMENT THAT WILL PAY THE

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:01.186
STATE BACK AND IMPROVED

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:02.955
COMPLIANCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:06:03.022 --> 02:06:04.957
SO WE THINK THAT'S A POSSIBLE

02:06:05.024 --> 02:06:06.725
AREA OF ACTIVITY. THE LAST AREA

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:08.994
THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS THE

02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:10.129
PROGRAM HAS ALSO STATED THAT

02:06:10.195 --> 02:06:11.764
THE AUTHORITIES IT HAS UNDER

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:13.299
THE STATE FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:14.767
PROGRAMS, ARE NOT WELL SUITED

02:06:14.833 --> 02:06:16.835
TO REGULATING HARMFUL CHEMICALS

02:06:16.902 --> 02:06:18.103
LIKE PFAS FOREVER CHEMICALS,

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:19.905
WHICH ARE SO WIDELY USED. TO

02:06:19.972 --> 02:06:21.907
OUR KNOWLEDGE. PFAS ARE KNOWN

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:24.143
TO BE USED IN OVER 200 PRODUCT

02:06:24.209 --> 02:06:25.010
CATEGORIES. ADDRESSING ONE

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:27.379
PRODUCT CATEGORY AT A TIME WILL

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:28.948
BE HERE FOR DECADES, IF NOT

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:31.951
MORE. AND SO THE RESOURCES THAT

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:33.185
WOULD GO WITH THAT APPROACH

02:06:33.252 --> 02:06:34.820
WOULD ALSO BE IMMENSE. THIS IS

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:35.854
WHY WE SUPPORTED THE ESSENTIAL

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:38.190
USE APPROACH THAT WAS EARLIER

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.858
REFLECTED IN 682. THIS YEAR.

02:06:39.925 --> 02:06:42.795
THE BILL HAS HAD TO BE NARROWED,

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:44.897
BUT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.265
FUTURE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:47.933
CONTEMPLATE ALTERNATIVE MODELS

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.601
FOR REGULATING UBIQUITOUS

02:06:49.668 --> 02:06:51.170
CHEMICALS THAT ARE USED SO

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:52.938
WIDELY, AND FOR WHICH I DON'T

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:55.607
THINK THE SCP PROGRAM IS REALLY,

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.910
REALLY DESIGNED. SO WITH THAT,

02:06:57.977 --> 02:06:59.945
I'LL PASS IT TO MY COLLEAGUES.

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:06.885
THANK YOU. THERE YOU GO. HELLO.

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:09.221
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON THIS

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:10.856
PANEL TODAY TO SHARE A LITTLE

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:12.558
BIT ABOUT THE PERSPECTIVE OF

02:07:12.624 --> 02:07:15.094
PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS AS IT

02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:15.894
RELATES TO SOURCE REDUCTION,

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:17.763
HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE AND

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:18.998
THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:20.632
PROGRAM. I AM NICOLE QUINONES.

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:22.001
I REPRESENT THE HOUSEHOLD AND

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:23.802
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION,

02:07:23.869 --> 02:07:25.004
WHOSE MEMBERS PRODUCE A VARIETY

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:26.872
OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:29.908
HOMES AND BUSINESSES, FROM THE

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:30.776
REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE SUPPLY

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.778
CHAIN, FROM INGREDIENT

02:07:32.845 --> 02:07:34.680
MANUFACTURERS TO THE FINISHED

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:35.814
PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS. SOME OF

02:07:35.881 --> 02:07:37.416
THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDE

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:38.317
DISINFECTANTS, CLEANING

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:39.952
PRODUCTS. PEST CONTROL

02:07:40.019 --> 02:07:41.887
SOLUTIONS. WE LIKE TO SAY

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:42.855
ANYTHING YOU WOULD FIND UNDER

02:07:42.921 --> 02:07:46.158
THE KITCHEN SINK OR OUT IN YOUR

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:47.159
GARAGE IS PROBABLY REPRESENTED

02:07:47.226 --> 02:07:48.627
BY OUR MEMBERSHIP. FIRST, I'LL

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:49.862
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:07:49.928 --> 02:07:52.297
HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE AND

02:07:52.364 --> 02:07:53.665
SOURCE REDUCTION. OUR MEMBERS

02:07:53.732 --> 02:07:54.867
CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE

02:07:54.933 --> 02:07:56.235
IMPORTANCE OF SOURCE REDUCTION

02:07:56.301 --> 02:07:58.670
WHEN THAT IS FEASIBLE AND WHEN

02:07:58.737 --> 02:07:59.972
CHEMISTRIES CAN'T BE REPLACED

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:03.275
OR ALL HAZARDS AVOIDED. PROPER

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:05.210
MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCTS WHEN

02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:06.712
THEY ARE ULTIMATELY WASTED IS

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:09.915
CERTAINLY PARAMOUNT. YOU KNOW,

02:08:09.982 --> 02:08:11.750
THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN AT

02:08:11.817 --> 02:08:13.786
ONE POINT DID HIGHLIGHT THE

02:08:13.852 --> 02:08:14.920
OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE THE

02:08:14.987 --> 02:08:16.588
AQUATIC TOXICITY TEST, WHICH IN

02:08:16.655 --> 02:08:18.891
ITS CURRENT FORM, IN OUR

02:08:18.957 --> 02:08:20.626
EXPERIENCE, REALLY LEADS TO AN

02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:22.394
OVER CATEGORIZATION OF

02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:23.862
HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE,

02:08:23.929 --> 02:08:24.830
RESULTING IN A NUMBER OF

02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:26.799
PRODUCTS BEING UNNECESSARILY

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:29.501
MANAGED AS AS HAZARDOUS WASTE.

02:08:29.568 --> 02:08:31.270
SO UPDATING THIS TEST METHOD

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:33.772
WOULD LEAD TO A MORE ACCURATE

02:08:33.839 --> 02:08:35.974
REPRESENTATION OF THE HAZARDOUS

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:37.943
WASTE PRODUCTS OUT THERE AND

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:41.180
SOURCE REDUCTION OF THAT THAT

02:08:41.246 --> 02:08:42.681
STREAM THE PRODUCTS GOING TO

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:43.949
HAZARDOUS WASTE. AND THIS IS

02:08:44.016 --> 02:08:46.351
JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF

02:08:46.418 --> 02:08:47.719
WORK THAT WE THINK THE

02:08:47.786 --> 02:08:48.821
DEPARTMENT WOULD IT WOULD BE

02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:50.022
VALUABLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO

02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:51.723
CONDUCT. AND WE BELIEVE THE

02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:52.858
FEES THAT ARE ALREADY PAID FOR

02:08:52.925 --> 02:08:55.227
BY BUSINESSES COULD GO TO

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:56.028
CONDUCTING THIS IMPORTANT WORK

02:08:56.095 --> 02:08:57.896
AND WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT TO TO

02:08:57.963 --> 02:09:01.767
MOVE FORWARD. HCPA IS ALSO

02:09:01.834 --> 02:09:03.435
WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH SENATOR

02:09:03.502 --> 02:09:04.069
ALLEN'S OFFICE AND STAKEHOLDERS

02:09:04.136 --> 02:09:06.738
ON SB 502, WHICH I WERE

02:09:06.805 --> 02:09:09.475
MENTIONED EARLIER. I'M SORRY,

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:13.412
SB 501. AS WE TRY TO EXPLORE

02:09:13.479 --> 02:09:15.647
STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE HOUSEHOLD

02:09:15.714 --> 02:09:17.883
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT IN A

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:19.618
WAY THAT INCENTIVIZES SOURCE

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:23.055
REDUCTION, BUT ALSO KEEPS COSTS

02:09:23.122 --> 02:09:26.391
LOW FOR EVERYONE FROM THE STATE.

02:09:26.458 --> 02:09:28.193
YOU KNOW, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:30.062
ARE COLLECTING THE PRODUCTS FOR

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:30.929
COMPANIES WHO ARE FUNDING THESE

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:32.965
SORTS OF PROGRAMS. AGAIN, AS

02:09:33.031 --> 02:09:34.700
THE CHAIR MENTIONED IN HER

02:09:34.766 --> 02:09:35.934
COMMENTS EARLIER. SO WE WILL

02:09:36.001 --> 02:09:37.236
CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:09:37.302 --> 02:09:38.704
THESE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE

02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:39.938
FALL RECESS. AND I JUST

02:09:40.005 --> 02:09:41.039
HIGHLIGHTED, I THINK IT SPEAKS

02:09:41.106 --> 02:09:43.709
TO THE WAY HCPA AND OUR MEMBERS

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:44.776
TRY TO TAKE ON THESE

02:09:44.843 --> 02:09:46.345
COMPLICATED ISSUES. WE TRY TO

02:09:46.411 --> 02:09:48.113
COME TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH

02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:51.116
SOLUTIONS. I, YOU KNOW, HAVE

02:09:51.183 --> 02:09:51.817
HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING

02:09:51.884 --> 02:09:53.852
WITH MR. CARR ON SEVERAL TOPICS

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.954
OVER THE YEARS, SB 502 BEING

02:09:56.021 --> 02:09:56.889
ONE OF THEM. BUT I ALSO JUST

02:09:56.955 --> 02:09:58.824
WANTED TO MENTION THAT WE

02:09:58.891 --> 02:09:59.958
WORKED ON A NEGOTIATED THE

02:10:00.025 --> 02:10:00.759
CLEANING PRODUCTS RIGHT TO KNOW

02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:03.862
ACT IN 2017, AND THE GOAL OF

02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:04.897
THAT BILL AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED

02:10:04.963 --> 02:10:07.132
IS REQUIRES THE INGREDIENTS OF

02:10:07.199 --> 02:10:07.933
CLEANING PRODUCTS TO BE ON THE

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.768
LABEL. SO GIVING NOT ONLY

02:10:09.835 --> 02:10:11.270
CONSUMERS MORE INFORMATION

02:10:11.336 --> 02:10:11.904
ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS IN THEIR

02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:14.039
PRODUCTS, BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW,

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:15.941
THE FOLKS THAT WORK AT DTSC WHO

02:10:16.008 --> 02:10:17.976
ARE DOING THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:19.244
PRODUCTS PROGRAM AND HAVE

02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:20.312
POINTED TO NEEDING THAT

02:10:20.379 --> 02:10:22.047
INFORMATION TO DO THEIR WORK.

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:24.883
SO I THINK THAT HAS BEEN

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:27.886
BENEFICIAL. AND THEN I'LL JUST

02:10:27.953 --> 02:10:29.788
NOTE, WHILE IT PREDATES MY TIME

02:10:29.855 --> 02:10:31.056
REPRESENTING HKPA, THEY WERE

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:32.691
ONE OF THE LEADING TRADE

02:10:32.758 --> 02:10:33.959
ASSOCIATIONS THAT NEGOTIATED

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:35.928
THE FOUNDING LEGISLATION THAT

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:37.596
CREATED THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:10:37.663 --> 02:10:39.064
PROGRAM AND DID SUPPORT THAT

02:10:39.131 --> 02:10:40.999
BILL. SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE A

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:42.267
VESTED INTEREST IN THE SUCCESS

02:10:42.334 --> 02:10:44.469
OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:10:44.536 --> 02:10:47.439
PROGRAM. SO TRANSITIONING TO

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:48.006
THAT PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY, I

02:10:48.073 --> 02:10:49.775
JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW,

02:10:49.841 --> 02:10:51.810
HKPA AS WELL AS I THINK OF A

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.145
LOT OF OTHER TRADE ASSOCIATIONS,

02:10:53.212 --> 02:10:54.813
MANUFACTURERS DO HAVE A REALLY

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:57.115
PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP

02:10:57.182 --> 02:10:58.050
WITH DTSC STAFF. THEY'VE ALWAYS

02:10:58.116 --> 02:11:00.752
BEEN OPEN AND WILLING TO HAVE

02:11:00.819 --> 02:11:01.987
CONVERSATIONS, AND THEY'RE VERY

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.956
INTERESTED, I THINK, IN BETTER

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:05.090
UNDERSTANDING HOW INDUSTRIES

02:11:05.157 --> 02:11:06.858
USE PARTICULAR INGREDIENTS,

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:08.026
WANTING TO LEARN ABOUT OUR

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:09.728
CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO

02:11:09.795 --> 02:11:11.129
SOURCING DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS

02:11:11.196 --> 02:11:13.665
OR REFORMULATING. AND IT REALLY

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:14.866
HAS HELPED INFORM THEIR

02:11:14.933 --> 02:11:16.068
RESEARCH AND THEIR PROCESS WHEN

02:11:16.134 --> 02:11:17.302
THEY'RE DEVELOPING THOSE

02:11:17.369 --> 02:11:18.904
BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS. AND JUST

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:20.739
TO BE CLEAR, EVEN THOUGH WE

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:21.940
HAVE A GOOD WORKING

02:11:22.007 --> 02:11:23.308
RELATIONSHIP, WE DISAGREE WITH

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:25.644
THEM VERY OFTEN. JUST, YOU KNOW,

02:11:25.711 --> 02:11:27.679
TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE COMMENT

02:11:27.746 --> 02:11:29.514
LETTERS WE FILED OVER ANY GIVEN

02:11:29.581 --> 02:11:30.716
REGULATION. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:32.884
WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE.

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:33.952
BUT THE IMPORTANCE IS THAT

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:35.954
POSITIVE DISCOURSE AND THE

02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:37.823
OPENNESS THAT THEY HAVE FOR ALL

02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:39.725
STAKEHOLDERS TO CONTINUE TO TO

02:11:39.791 --> 02:11:42.828
ADVANCE THE PROGRAM. SO AS IT'S

02:11:42.894 --> 02:11:44.763
BEEN MENTIONED, OBVIOUSLY THE

02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:47.899
SCP IS INTENDED TO GUIDE OUR

02:11:47.966 --> 02:11:50.369
INDUSTRIES TO REMOVE OR REPLACE

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:52.204
INGREDIENTS THAT MAY HAVE

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:53.005
NEGATIVE HEALTH OR

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:54.206
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND AVOID

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:55.807
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS. I

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:57.142
KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:11:57.209 --> 02:11:58.844
THAT TODAY, BUT ALSO, I'M SURE

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:01.113
YOU'VE ALL HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:12:01.179 --> 02:12:02.114
THAT AS YOU'RE OVER YOUR TIME

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:02.948
IN THE LEGISLATURE, BUT IT

02:12:03.015 --> 02:12:04.950
REALLY IS WHAT WAS AT THE HEART

02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:06.952
OF THE INITIAL VISION OF THE

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:07.819
PROGRAM TO TAKE THAT SCIENTIFIC

02:12:07.886 --> 02:12:08.854
AND HOLISTIC APPROACH TO

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:11.456
INGREDIENT POLICY SO THAT

02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:12.658
HOPEFULLY THE LEGISLATURE

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:15.594
WOULDN'T BE ASKED AS OFTEN TO

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:17.029
DECIDE OR MAKE DETERMINATIONS

02:12:17.095 --> 02:12:19.431
ON THESE VERY COMPLEX QUESTIONS

02:12:19.498 --> 02:12:21.033
OF WHETHER AN INGREDIENT IN A

02:12:21.099 --> 02:12:23.435
PRODUCT POSES AN UNREASONABLE

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:24.736
RISK. WHICH JUST BRINGS ME TO A

02:12:24.803 --> 02:12:27.205
VERY QUICK ASIDE REGARDING THE

02:12:27.272 --> 02:12:28.707
RISK VERSUS HAZARD APPROACH. I

02:12:28.774 --> 02:12:31.476
KNOW THAT GETS TALKED ABOUT A

02:12:31.543 --> 02:12:33.478
LOT HERE. AND JUST THAT, YOU

02:12:33.545 --> 02:12:37.182
KNOW, THE HAZARD REFERS TO THE

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:39.017
POTENTIAL OF A CHEMICAL TO

02:12:39.084 --> 02:12:40.852
CAUSE HARM. BUT ALMOST

02:12:40.919 --> 02:12:42.888
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW HAS A

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:44.990
HAZARD FROM, YOU KNOW, WATER,

02:12:45.057 --> 02:12:47.693
H2O, OXYGEN, ESSENTIAL VITAMINS,

02:12:47.759 --> 02:12:48.960
THINGS THAT WE WOULD AGREE ARE

02:12:49.027 --> 02:12:51.029
HEALTHY FOR US IN THE RIGHT

02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:52.064
LEVELS AND NECESSARY FOR OUR

02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:54.866
SURVIVAL. BUT THOSE THINGS HAVE

02:12:54.933 --> 02:12:58.470
A VERY LOW RISK OF CREATING, OR

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:00.906
I SHOULD SAY, SUCH A LOW RISK

02:13:00.972 --> 02:13:01.673
THAT WE'VE ALL DECIDED,

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:03.208
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, ANY

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.077
POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE

02:13:05.143 --> 02:13:07.245
OUTWEIGHED BY THE BENEFITS AND

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:09.514
A HAZARD. WHILE HAZARD BASED

02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:10.716
APPROACH FOCUSES ON A

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.884
CHEMICAL'S POTENTIAL FOR HARM,

02:13:12.951 --> 02:13:14.686
WITHOUT CONSIDERING HOW MUCH OR

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:16.154
HOW OFTEN PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO

02:13:16.221 --> 02:13:18.590
IT. WHILE A RISK BASED APPROACH

02:13:18.657 --> 02:13:19.658
REALLY INTEGRATES BOTH THE

02:13:19.725 --> 02:13:21.059
HAZARDS OF THE CHEMICAL AND THE

02:13:21.126 --> 02:13:22.928
LIKELIHOOD OF EXPOSURE. SO

02:13:22.994 --> 02:13:24.196
LOOKING AT THE REAL WORLD

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:26.865
SCENARIOS AND HOW THOSE

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:28.700
EVALUATING THOSE POTENTIAL

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:30.035
DANGERS, AND I JUST BRING THIS

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:32.037
UP, NOT TO DEBATE WHETHER

02:13:32.104 --> 02:13:32.804
CALIFORNIA'S CHEMICAL POLICY

02:13:32.871 --> 02:13:34.806
SHOULD BE RISK OR HAZARD BASED,

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:36.375
BUT TO DEMONSTRATE JUST HOW

02:13:36.441 --> 02:13:37.976
COMPLEX AND NUANCED THESE

02:13:38.043 --> 02:13:40.078
POLICIES ARE, WHICH A LARGE

02:13:40.145 --> 02:13:41.713
REASON, AGAIN, IS WHY THE

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:42.881
LEGISLATURE DIRECTED DTSC TO

02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:44.883
CREATE THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:46.084
PRODUCTS PROGRAM SO THAT THEIR

02:13:46.151 --> 02:13:47.786
SCIENTISTS COULD DIG INTO THE

02:13:47.853 --> 02:13:49.621
SCIENCE BEHIND INGREDIENTS,

02:13:49.688 --> 02:13:51.089
CONSIDER THE NUANCES AND THE

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:53.925
TRADE OFFS. WHEN ONE INGREDIENT

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:55.727
IS REPLACED WITH ANOTHER, OR AN

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:57.863
INGREDIENT IS TAKEN OUT OF A

02:13:57.929 --> 02:13:59.431
PRODUCT AND ALL OF THE IN

02:13:59.498 --> 02:14:00.065
BETWEEN, OR BANNED ALTOGETHER,

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:02.167
WHICH IS ALL WITHIN THEIR

02:14:02.234 --> 02:14:02.934
REGULATORY AUTHORITY. AND I

02:14:03.001 --> 02:14:06.171
REALLY JUST WANTED TO FOCUS MY

02:14:06.238 --> 02:14:09.074
TIME ON TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OR

02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:10.976
EXPLAIN HOW WE CAN URGE THE

02:14:11.042 --> 02:14:12.644
LEGISLATURE TO RELY A LITTLE

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.379
BIT MORE ON THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:14:14.446 --> 02:14:15.380
PRODUCTS PROGRAM SO THAT THE

02:14:15.447 --> 02:14:16.815
TOXICOLOGIST, THE CHEMIST, THE

02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:18.717
ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS ARE

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:20.085
DETERMINING THE SOUND POLICIES

02:14:20.152 --> 02:14:23.255
FOR CALIFORNIA WHILE KEEPING

02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:24.990
THEM EXTREMELY PROTECTIVE OF

02:14:25.056 --> 02:14:25.690
THE HUMAN HEALTH AND THE

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:28.827
ENVIRONMENT. SO FIRST, YOU KNOW,

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:30.295
MY POINT, WHICH HAS ALREADY

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:31.763
BEEN TALKED ABOUT, IS JUST THE

02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:33.665
SIGNALS THAT THE PROGRAM DOES

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.000
SEND TO THE MANUFACTURERS, BOTH

02:14:35.066 --> 02:14:35.634
THROUGH THE CANDIDATES

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.002
CHEMICALS LIST AND THE PRIORITY

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:39.571
PRODUCTS WORK PLAN. SO INDUSTRY

02:14:39.638 --> 02:14:40.906
GETS A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT

02:14:40.972 --> 02:14:42.874
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT IN THE

02:14:42.941 --> 02:14:43.842
FUTURE, AND IT REALLY ALLOWS

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:45.944
THEM TO START WHAT IS A VERY

02:14:46.011 --> 02:14:47.045
LONG PROCESS. AND WE'VE TALKED

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:48.613
ABOUT HOW LONG AN ALTERNATIVES

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:50.115
ANALYSIS CAN TAKE. BUT THE

02:14:50.182 --> 02:14:51.249
PROCESS INTERNALLY OF LOOKING

02:14:51.316 --> 02:14:52.951
AT ALTERNATIVE INGREDIENTS, OR

02:14:53.018 --> 02:14:53.919
WILL THE PRODUCT PERFORM AS

02:14:53.985 --> 02:14:55.353
WELL WITHOUT CERTAIN

02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:57.622
INGREDIENTS ALSO TAKES TIME.

02:14:57.689 --> 02:15:00.125
AND A LOT OF OUR MANUFACTURERS,

02:15:00.192 --> 02:15:01.460
THEY'RE GOING TO INGREDIENT

02:15:01.526 --> 02:15:02.027
SUPPLIERS. AND SO SOMETIMES

02:15:02.093 --> 02:15:03.728
THIS PROCESS MEANS GOING TO

02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:05.297
SUPPLIERS AND COMING UP WITH

02:15:05.363 --> 02:15:07.265
NEW SOLUTIONS OR NEW

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:08.867
INGREDIENTS. AND SO WORKING

02:15:08.934 --> 02:15:10.602
THROUGH THOSE THOSE

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:11.803
COMPLEXITIES. BUT YOU KNOW

02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:13.338
THOSE SIGNALS ARE EXTREMELY

02:15:13.405 --> 02:15:14.739
IMPORTANT. THEY ARE HARD TO

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:16.808
QUANTIFY UNFORTUNATELY. BUT YOU

02:15:16.875 --> 02:15:19.110
KNOW, THEY ARE THERE AND

02:15:19.177 --> 02:15:21.713
THEY'RE IMPACTFUL. SECONDLY IS

02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:23.048
JUST YOU KNOW, SCIENCE TAKES

02:15:23.114 --> 02:15:24.683
TIME. AND I UNDERSTAND HOW

02:15:24.749 --> 02:15:26.918
FRUSTRATING IT CAN BE FOR THE

02:15:26.985 --> 02:15:28.420
LEGISLATURE AND THE ADVOCATES

02:15:28.487 --> 02:15:30.956
SITTING BESIDE ME OVER THE PACE

02:15:31.022 --> 02:15:32.958
OF PROGRESS. AND I THINK

02:15:33.024 --> 02:15:33.758
SOMEWHAT BORNE OUT OF THE

02:15:33.825 --> 02:15:36.094
FRUSTRATION, BUT NOT ENTIRELY.

02:15:36.161 --> 02:15:37.596
WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN

02:15:37.662 --> 02:15:38.797
CHEMICAL BAN BILLS YEAR AFTER

02:15:38.864 --> 02:15:41.032
YEAR, YOU KNOW, LIKELY AS A

02:15:41.099 --> 02:15:43.935
RESULT. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT

02:15:44.002 --> 02:15:46.271
SURPRISING. I THINK WE CAN ALL

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:47.138
APPRECIATE THAT A REGULATORY

02:15:47.205 --> 02:15:48.807
AGENCY WILL TAKE A LONGER TIME

02:15:48.874 --> 02:15:50.942
TO STUDY AN INGREDIENT.

02:15:51.009 --> 02:15:52.644
CONSIDER IF PRODUCTS WITH THOSE

02:15:52.711 --> 02:15:53.845
INGREDIENTS POSE A RISK TO

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.013
CALIFORNIANS, YOU KNOW, PUT

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.015
THEIR BACKGROUND INFORMATION

02:15:57.082 --> 02:15:59.084
TOGETHER, GET FEEDBACK FROM ALL

02:15:59.150 --> 02:16:00.685
THE STAKEHOLDERS, AND REALLY DO

02:16:00.752 --> 02:16:01.887
THEIR PROCESS. THAT'S GOING TO

02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:03.889
TAKE LONGER THAN THE TEN MONTHS

02:16:03.955 --> 02:16:05.023
IT TAKES TO INTRODUCE A BILL

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:07.092
AND ULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW, HAVE

02:16:07.158 --> 02:16:08.660
IT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND

02:16:08.727 --> 02:16:10.662
I'LL JUST SAY A PROMISE THAT

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:12.197
INDUSTRY DOES NOT LOOK AT THE

02:16:12.264 --> 02:16:13.098
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:15.700
AS A DELAY TACTIC. BUT WE DO

02:16:15.767 --> 02:16:17.903
THINK, YOU KNOW, FASTER IS NOT

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.804
ALWAYS BETTER. THERE WILL

02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:22.274
ALWAYS BE TRADE OFFS FROM THE

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:23.775
POLICIES ENACTED, BUT IT'S HARD

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:24.976
TO STUDY THOSE TRADE OFFS

02:16:25.043 --> 02:16:26.578
DURING THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION.

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:28.914
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:30.916
LEGISLATURE IS, IS THERE A

02:16:30.982 --> 02:16:32.551
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR

02:16:32.617 --> 02:16:33.718
DTSC TO DO THEIR EVALUATION? AM

02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:36.087
I GETTING THAT? OKAY, THEN I

02:16:36.154 --> 02:16:38.924
WILL FINISH UP AND I'LL JUST

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:41.059
ASK, YOU KNOW, MY BIG POINT IS

02:16:41.126 --> 02:16:42.727
MY LAST POINT IS ON THE BIG

02:16:42.794 --> 02:16:44.796
STUFF. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE

02:16:44.863 --> 02:16:45.964
BACKGROUNDER DOES QUESTION

02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:48.033
WHETHER DTSC OR PUTS IT OUT

02:16:48.099 --> 02:16:50.602
THERE, WHETHER THEY COULD DO,

02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:53.838
YOU KNOW, A REAL PFAS

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:55.874
REGULATION OR, YOU KNOW, WORK

02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:56.841
ON MICROPLASTICS, THESE

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:58.610
INGREDIENTS THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:16:58.677 --> 02:17:00.278
TOUCH A LOT OF PRODUCTS OR USE

02:17:00.345 --> 02:17:01.913
VERY DIFFERENTLY. BUT I GUESS

02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:04.015
OUR PUSHBACK WOULD BE THESE ARE

02:17:04.082 --> 02:17:06.117
EXACTLY THE TYPES OF POLICIES

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:08.420
THAT NEED DTSC EXPERTISE. AGAIN,

02:17:08.486 --> 02:17:09.654
IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY

02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:11.890
CHALLENGING TO CRAFT THIS

02:17:11.957 --> 02:17:15.060
LEGISLATION, YOU KNOW, WITHOUT

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:17.629
THEIR THEIR EXPERTISE. SO, YOU

02:17:17.696 --> 02:17:20.131
KNOW, I THINK WITH THAT, WE

02:17:20.198 --> 02:17:23.435
WOULD JUST CONCLUDE, YOU KNOW,

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:24.069
BEFORE TURNING TO LEGISLATION,

02:17:24.135 --> 02:17:25.704
HOW CAN WE ALLOW THE SAFER

02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:27.706
CONSUMER PRODUCTS TO DO THE

02:17:27.772 --> 02:17:29.040
WORK THAT YOU ALL HAVE

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:31.076
DESIGNATED THEM TO DO, WHICH IS

02:17:31.142 --> 02:17:32.043
SCIENCE DRIVEN, TRANSPARENT AND

02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:33.778
PROTECTIVE OF THE HEALTH AND

02:17:33.845 --> 02:17:40.685
THE ENVIRONMENT? THANK YOU. HI.

02:17:40.752 --> 02:17:43.021
GOOD MORNING. I WANT TO THANK

02:17:43.088 --> 02:17:44.756
THE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

02:17:44.823 --> 02:17:46.758
TO SPEAK TODAY. I'LL BE

02:17:46.825 --> 02:17:48.426
FOCUSING MY COMMENTS ON GAPS

02:17:48.493 --> 02:17:50.028
AND CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL

02:17:50.095 --> 02:17:50.895
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DTSC AS IT

02:17:50.962 --> 02:17:53.331
RELATES TO SOURCE REDUCTION AND

02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:54.833
POLLUTION PREVENTION. BUT FIRST,

02:17:54.899 --> 02:17:57.068
I WANT TO REMIND US ABOUT THE

02:17:57.135 --> 02:17:58.303
URGENCY OF THE CHALLENGES WE

02:17:58.370 --> 02:18:00.372
FACE TODAY. THE USE OF TOXIC

02:18:00.438 --> 02:18:01.072
CHEMICALS CONTINUES TO IMPACT

02:18:01.139 --> 02:18:02.607
THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS, OF

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:03.942
PARTICULARLY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:05.076
JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:06.578
EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST BURDENS

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:08.580
OF POLLUTION, FROM EXTRACTION

02:18:08.647 --> 02:18:09.881
TO MANUFACTURING TO PRODUCT USE,

02:18:09.948 --> 02:18:11.783
TO RECYCLING TO DISPOSAL AND

02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:13.218
EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.

02:18:13.284 --> 02:18:13.885
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:18:13.952 --> 02:18:15.153
COMMUNITIES LIVE AT THE FRONT

02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:16.688
LINES AND CONTINUE TO

02:18:16.755 --> 02:18:17.155
EXPERIENCE DEVASTATING

02:18:17.222 --> 02:18:19.924
CONSEQUENCES TO THEIR HEALTH.

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:20.959
SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE STATE IS

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:21.793
FINDING IT MORE AND MORE

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.094
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE

02:18:23.161 --> 02:18:25.664
HAZARDOUS WASTE IT GENERATES,

02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:26.998
DTSC ACKNOWLEDGES IN ITS DRAFT

02:18:27.065 --> 02:18:28.199
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

02:18:28.266 --> 02:18:30.101
THAT SOURCE REDUCTION IS THE

02:18:30.168 --> 02:18:31.202
MOST PREFERRED STRATEGY IN

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:32.570
MANAGING WASTE AND ULTIMATELY

02:18:32.637 --> 02:18:35.106
TO REDUCING HEALTH IMPACTS TO

02:18:35.173 --> 02:18:35.974
COMMUNITIES. BUT IT'S NOT

02:18:36.041 --> 02:18:38.243
ENOUGH TO SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE

02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.843
SOURCE REDUCTIONS IMPORTANCE.

02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:40.745
THE AGENCY MUST DO THE

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.447
DIFFICULT WORK TO REORIENT ITS

02:18:42.514 --> 02:18:44.015
WORK TO PRIORITIZE SOURCE

02:18:44.082 --> 02:18:45.884
REDUCTION ACROSS ITS PROGRAMS,

02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:46.951
BEGINNING WITH STRENGTHENING

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:47.819
THE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:48.887
PLAN WITH MEANINGFUL,

02:18:48.953 --> 02:18:50.955
MEASURABLE GOALS AND ACTIONABLE

02:18:51.022 --> 02:18:51.790
RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE USE

02:18:51.856 --> 02:18:53.858
OF TOXICS AND HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:18:53.925 --> 02:18:56.828
GENERATION AT THE SOURCE. AND I

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:57.996
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:18:58.063 --> 02:18:59.431
REMEMBER THAT WHILE OTHER WASTE

02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:00.231
REDUCTION EFFORTS, INCLUDING

02:19:00.298 --> 02:19:01.700
CERTAIN KINDS OF RECYCLING, MAY

02:19:01.766 --> 02:19:03.034
HAVE A ROLE IN A BROADER

02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:04.069
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT AND

02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:05.103
TRANSITION STRATEGY, THESE DO

02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:06.705
NOT DIRECTLY REDUCE THE USE OF

02:19:06.771 --> 02:19:08.073
TOXICS AND GENERATION OF

02:19:08.139 --> 02:19:10.108
HAZARDOUS WASTE UPSTREAM AT THE

02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:11.176
SOURCE, WHERE IT IS MOST

02:19:11.242 --> 02:19:12.944
EFFECTIVE AND MOST NEEDED. WE

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:14.913
NEED STRONG REGULATORY,

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:16.815
REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND

02:19:16.881 --> 02:19:18.950
PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY,

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:19.851
WILLINGNESS TO TAKE BOLD

02:19:19.918 --> 02:19:21.086
ACTIONS THAT ADVANCE SOURCE

02:19:21.152 --> 02:19:23.988
REDUCTION. NEXT, I'D LIKE TO

02:19:24.055 --> 02:19:25.790
DISCUSS SOME OF THE PAST AND

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:26.291
CURRENT SOURCE REDUCTION

02:19:26.357 --> 02:19:27.792
ACTIVITIES AT DTSC. FROM THE

02:19:27.859 --> 02:19:30.862
1980S TO 2013, DTSC HAD ITS OWN

02:19:30.929 --> 02:19:31.963
POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM

02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:33.698
THAT PROGRAMS ACTIVITIES

02:19:33.765 --> 02:19:35.934
TYPICALLY FOCUSED ON VOLUNTARY

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.969
ACTIVITIES WITH A NARROW SET OF

02:19:38.036 --> 02:19:39.404
SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES. THE

02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:40.972
PROGRAM DID SEE SOME BENEFITS,

02:19:41.039 --> 02:19:41.539
INCLUDING STRONGER EXPERTISE

02:19:41.606 --> 02:19:43.875
WITHIN DTSC STAFF ON INDUSTRY

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:45.143
INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOURCE

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:46.778
REDUCTION STRATEGIES, BUT WITH

02:19:46.845 --> 02:19:48.046
ITS LIMITATIONS, THE PROGRAM

02:19:48.113 --> 02:19:49.581
DID NOT ULTIMATELY LEAD TO

02:19:49.647 --> 02:19:51.082
LARGE VOLUMES OF REDUCTIONS IN

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:53.151
GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.

02:19:53.218 --> 02:19:54.219
THE POLLUTION PREVENTION

02:19:54.285 --> 02:19:55.754
PROGRAM WAS SUNSET IN 2013 TO

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:58.123
GIVE WAY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT

02:19:58.189 --> 02:19:58.923
OF TODAY'S SAFER CONSUMER

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:00.992
PRODUCTS PROGRAM, IDENTIFYING

02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:02.627
AND ENCOURAGING SAFER

02:20:02.694 --> 02:20:03.795
ALTERNATIVES IN CONSUMER

02:20:03.862 --> 02:20:05.196
PRODUCTS IS A KEY PART OF

02:20:05.263 --> 02:20:06.598
SOURCE REDUCTION AND AN

02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:07.732
IMPORTANT REGULATORY ROLE FOR

02:20:07.799 --> 02:20:10.001
DTSC. BUT THERE MAY BE WAYS FOR

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:11.870
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS TO BE

02:20:11.936 --> 02:20:12.771
MORE EFFECTIVE IN ITS WORK, AND

02:20:12.837 --> 02:20:13.938
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL

02:20:14.005 --> 02:20:15.340
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOURCE

02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:16.207
REDUCTION AND POLLUTION

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:17.008
PREVENTION THAT GO BEYOND SAFER

02:20:17.075 --> 02:20:19.043
CONSUMER PRODUCTS. EXISTING

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:20.879
SCOPE IN TERMS OF INCREASING

02:20:20.945 --> 02:20:22.180
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:22.981
EFFECTIVENESS, THERE'S ALREADY

02:20:23.047 --> 02:20:24.883
BEEN SOME DISCUSSION, SO I

02:20:24.949 --> 02:20:26.217
WON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME HERE,

02:20:26.284 --> 02:20:27.919
BUT I DO ECHO CONCERNS ABOUT

02:20:27.986 --> 02:20:29.287
THE SLOW PACE OF PROGRESS

02:20:29.354 --> 02:20:30.622
WITHIN THESE PROCESSES. THERE

02:20:30.688 --> 02:20:32.223
IS SO MUCH THAT IS ALREADY

02:20:32.290 --> 02:20:33.158
KNOWN ABOUT THESE CHEMICALS AND

02:20:33.224 --> 02:20:35.126
THEIR HAZARDS, AND WE MUST FIND

02:20:35.193 --> 02:20:36.127
WAYS TO LEVERAGE THIS EXISTING

02:20:36.194 --> 02:20:37.762
KNOWLEDGE TO TAKE REGULATORY

02:20:37.829 --> 02:20:39.631
ACTION TO PROTECT HEALTH FASTER.

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:41.699
WE ALSO NEED STRONGER

02:20:41.766 --> 02:20:42.967
REGULATORY MECHANISMS TO

02:20:43.034 --> 02:20:44.102
IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT INNOVATION

02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:46.237
OF SAFER ALTERNATIVES, BRINGING

02:20:46.304 --> 02:20:48.306
THOSE ALTERNATIVES TO MARKET

02:20:48.373 --> 02:20:49.140
AND IMPROVING ACCESSIBILITY AND

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:50.875
WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF SAFER

02:20:50.942 --> 02:20:54.345
ALTERNATIVES. IN ADDITION, IN

02:20:54.412 --> 02:20:54.946
SITUATIONS WHERE MANUFACTURERS

02:20:55.013 --> 02:20:56.981
MOVE TO PROACTIVELY REMOVE A

02:20:57.048 --> 02:20:58.082
CANDIDATE CHEMICAL FROM THEIR

02:20:58.149 --> 02:20:59.684
PRODUCT TO AVOID TRIGGERING THE

02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:01.085
REGULATORY PROCESS, IT WOULD BE

02:21:01.152 --> 02:21:02.287
BENEFICIAL TO STILL GAIN

02:21:02.353 --> 02:21:03.888
INSIGHTS INTO HOW THE PRODUCT

02:21:03.955 --> 02:21:04.956
WAS REFORMULATED TO MAINTAIN

02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:06.157
AWARENESS OF WHAT'S IN THESE

02:21:06.224 --> 02:21:06.825
PRODUCTS AND POTENTIAL

02:21:06.891 --> 02:21:07.992
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS.

02:21:08.059 --> 02:21:09.861
SINCE THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS

02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:11.329
PROCESS, WHICH WOULD HAVE

02:21:11.396 --> 02:21:12.330
PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION ABOUT

02:21:12.397 --> 02:21:14.933
SUBSTITUTES WAS NOT TRIGGERED.

02:21:14.999 --> 02:21:15.800
THERE ARE ALSO SOME SOURCE

02:21:15.867 --> 02:21:17.101
REDUCTION STRATEGIES THAT MAY

02:21:17.168 --> 02:21:18.770
NOT FIT INTO SAFER CONSUMER

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:20.004
PRODUCTS. EXISTING SPECIFIC

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:21.940
FOCUS ON CONSUMER PRODUCTS, BUT

02:21:22.006 --> 02:21:24.309
ARE IMPORTANT FOR DTSC TO

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:26.044
CONSIDER AND INCORPORATE. IN

02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:26.911
ADDITION TO CHEMICALS IN THE

02:21:26.978 --> 02:21:28.580
PRODUCT ITSELF, THERE MAY BE

02:21:28.646 --> 02:21:30.181
SOME CHEMICALS THAT ARE USED IN

02:21:30.248 --> 02:21:30.882
THE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES

02:21:30.949 --> 02:21:32.083
THAT SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:33.685
MAY NOT TARGET, FOR EXAMPLE,

02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:34.752
INDUSTRIAL SOLVENTS THAT ARE

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:36.187
USED IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES

02:21:36.254 --> 02:21:37.922
TO DISSOLVE OR DILUTE OTHER

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:39.891
CHEMICALS. IN ADDITION TO THE

02:21:39.958 --> 02:21:41.860
CHEMICALS USED IN PRODUCTS, THE

02:21:41.926 --> 02:21:42.727
DESIGN OF PRODUCTS, AND

02:21:42.794 --> 02:21:44.429
DESIGNING PRODUCTS TO BE EASILY

02:21:44.495 --> 02:21:44.963
BROKEN UP INTO ITS VARIOUS

02:21:45.029 --> 02:21:46.531
COMPONENTS FOR END OF LIFE MAY

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:48.032
OFFER OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE

02:21:48.099 --> 02:21:50.501
WASTE. DSC WOULD ALSO BENEFIT

02:21:50.568 --> 02:21:51.636
FROM REGULARLY COLLECTING DATA

02:21:51.703 --> 02:21:53.037
ON USE OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:54.939
AND PURPOSE OF THOSE USES, AS

02:21:55.006 --> 02:21:56.174
WELL AS BETTER DATA ON

02:21:56.241 --> 02:21:58.009
HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION. THE

02:21:58.076 --> 02:21:59.277
AGENCY SHOULD COLLABORATE WITH

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:00.612
THE PUBLIC, SCIENTIFIC,

02:22:00.678 --> 02:22:01.846
ACADEMIC AND THOSE WITH

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:02.881
INDUSTRY SPECIFIC EXPERTISE TO

02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:04.582
IDENTIFY WHAT DATA WOULD BE THE

02:22:04.649 --> 02:22:05.750
MOST USEFUL. TO PROVIDE

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:06.851
DETAILED INSIGHTS FOR THE

02:22:06.918 --> 02:22:08.887
DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:09.821
PRIORITIES, AND TO ALLOW FOR

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:12.423
IMPROVED TRACKING OF PROGRESS

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:13.992
OVER TIME, AND TO DEVELOP DATA

02:22:14.058 --> 02:22:15.760
SYSTEMS THAT ARE THAT ALLOW FOR

02:22:15.827 --> 02:22:18.129
FASTER, REAL TIME ANALYSIS,

02:22:18.196 --> 02:22:20.098
WHICH HAS BEEN A PROBLEM IN THE

02:22:20.164 --> 02:22:22.166
PAST. DTSC REGULATORY ROLE

02:22:22.233 --> 02:22:23.735
COULD ALSO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

02:22:23.801 --> 02:22:24.936
MANDATED TRAINING ON SOURCE

02:22:25.003 --> 02:22:26.204
REDUCTION STRATEGIES FOR THOSE

02:22:26.271 --> 02:22:27.672
WHO USE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS AND

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:29.741
GENERATE HAZARDOUS WASTE, AND

02:22:29.807 --> 02:22:31.376
PROVISION OF INDUSTRY SPECIFIC

02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:31.876
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:32.577
BUSINESSES TO DEVELOP

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:34.412
ACTIONABLE SOURCE REDUCTION

02:22:34.479 --> 02:22:37.015
PLANS. LASTLY, DTC SHOULD DO

02:22:37.081 --> 02:22:38.950
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TO IDENTIFY,

02:22:39.017 --> 02:22:41.452
ASSESS FOR SAFETY AND STRONGLY

02:22:41.519 --> 02:22:42.787
INCENTIVIZE OR REQUIRE SAFER

02:22:42.854 --> 02:22:45.723
ALTERNATIVES. IN CLOSING, WE

02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:48.826
KNOW, AND DTC SEEMS TO BE IN

02:22:48.893 --> 02:22:49.294
AGREEMENT, THAT SOURCE

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.995
REDUCTION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE

02:22:51.062 --> 02:22:52.130
STRATEGY TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO

02:22:52.196 --> 02:22:53.865
TOXIC CHEMICALS AND HAZARDOUS

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:55.166
WASTES, AND TO REDUCE THE

02:22:55.233 --> 02:22:56.768
ENORMOUS BURDEN OF MANAGING

02:22:56.834 --> 02:22:58.836
DANGEROUS HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE

02:22:58.903 --> 02:23:00.071
PROBLEMS WE FACE RELATED TO

02:23:00.138 --> 02:23:00.939
TOXIC EXPOSURES AND GENERATION

02:23:01.005 --> 02:23:02.874
OF HAZARDOUS WASTE ARE URGENT,

02:23:02.941 --> 02:23:04.676
AND THEY DEMAND THAT WE MOVE

02:23:04.742 --> 02:23:06.144
BEYOND MERELY EXPRESSING OR

02:23:06.210 --> 02:23:06.878
DISCUSSING THESE CONCEPTS. WE

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:10.048
NEED TO DEVELOP THE WILLINGNESS

02:23:10.114 --> 02:23:11.382
TO TAKE PROACTIVE, BOLD ACTION

02:23:11.449 --> 02:23:12.750
TO REDUCE HAZARDOUS WASTE AT

02:23:12.817 --> 02:23:15.620
THE SOURCE AND PROTECT

02:23:15.687 --> 02:23:16.321
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,

02:23:16.387 --> 02:23:17.989
COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:23:18.056 --> 02:23:22.026
THANK YOU. OKAY, GREAT. WELL,

02:23:22.093 --> 02:23:23.761
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE

02:23:23.828 --> 02:23:24.896
THREE OF YOU. WE REALLY

02:23:24.963 --> 02:23:25.863
APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. I

02:23:25.930 --> 02:23:28.099
THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO

02:23:28.166 --> 02:23:28.900
PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THIS POINT.

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:30.768
WE ARE AIMING TO HAVE THIS BE

02:23:30.835 --> 02:23:34.639
CONCLUDED BY 12. SO WE THANK

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:35.073
YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR

02:23:35.139 --> 02:23:37.842
CONTRIBUTIONS. AND IF YOU HAVE

02:23:37.909 --> 02:23:39.610
PUBLIC COMMENTS, PLEASE COME

02:23:39.677 --> 02:23:45.483
FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE. AND

02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:48.486
IF YOU COULD MAKE YOUR COMMENTS

02:23:48.553 --> 02:23:50.755
CONCISE AND BRIEF, WE WOULD

02:23:50.822 --> 02:23:52.090
APPRECIATE IT. SO PLEASE COME

02:23:52.156 --> 02:23:54.125
FORWARD IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A

02:23:54.192 --> 02:23:55.860
PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY. THANK YOU.

02:23:55.927 --> 02:23:57.161
GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

02:23:57.228 --> 02:23:58.363
NANCY BIERMEIER WITH BREAST

02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:59.797
CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS.

02:23:59.864 --> 02:24:01.132
WE'RE A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION

02:24:01.199 --> 02:24:02.133
WORKING TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:03.735
CHEMICALS LINKED TO THE DISEASE.

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:06.270
WE WERE PART OF CREATING THE

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:07.739
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM.

02:24:07.805 --> 02:24:09.007
WE SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:24:09.073 --> 02:24:11.376
EXPRESSED NOT ONLY BY THE

02:24:11.442 --> 02:24:12.110
COMMITTEE, BUT BY OUR

02:24:12.176 --> 02:24:13.745
COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE SLOWNESS

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.580
OF THE PROJECT, OF THE OF THE

02:24:15.646 --> 02:24:16.981
PROGRESS, BUT ALSO ENCOURAGED

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:19.917
BY THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTS,

02:24:19.984 --> 02:24:20.852
ALSO ENCOURAGED THAT THE BOARD

02:24:20.918 --> 02:24:22.787
IS GOING TO BE DOING SPECIFIC

02:24:22.854 --> 02:24:24.088
METRICS, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:24:24.155 --> 02:24:24.822
WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND

02:24:24.889 --> 02:24:26.858
THEIR STAFF ON THAT PIECE. WE

02:24:26.924 --> 02:24:28.459
WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE

02:24:28.526 --> 02:24:30.328
DEPARTMENT AND THE PROGRAM TO

02:24:30.395 --> 02:24:33.197
BE VERY PROACTIVE. AND TO QUOTE

02:24:33.264 --> 02:24:34.732
MY COLLEAGUE, BOLD IN REALLY

02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:36.834
STRETCHED TO TAKE FULL

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:38.536
ADVANTAGE OF THE AUTHORITIES

02:24:38.603 --> 02:24:41.939
GIVEN IT BY SB 502. AND FINALLY,

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:42.774
WHILE FIVE PRIORITY PRODUCTS

02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:46.177
PER YEAR IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL

02:24:46.244 --> 02:24:47.745
GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF

02:24:47.812 --> 02:24:49.781
PRIORITY OF PRODUCTS THAT WE

02:24:49.847 --> 02:24:52.283
ARE SOLD IN THE STATE, AND THE

02:24:52.350 --> 02:24:53.751
INCREDIBLY LARGE NUMBER OF

02:24:53.818 --> 02:24:55.586
CHEMICALS THAT ARE IN THEM,

02:24:55.653 --> 02:24:58.156
THAT CAN'T BE THE ONLY THING WE

02:24:58.222 --> 02:24:59.824
DO. THE LEGISLATURE STILL HAS A

02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:01.993
ROLE TO PLAY. WE DON'T NEED A

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:03.094
CREW OF TOXICOLOGISTS TO TELL

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:05.630
US THAT PFAS ARE BAD FOR US. WE

02:25:05.696 --> 02:25:07.865
KNOW THAT WE DON'T NEED THE WE

02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:09.167
DON'T NEED THE EXPERTISE OF THE

02:25:09.233 --> 02:25:10.835
PROGRAM TO TELL US PFAS IN

02:25:10.902 --> 02:25:12.870
DENTAL FLOSS IS A BAD IDEA.

02:25:12.937 --> 02:25:14.672
THAT'S THE ROLE THAT YOU ALL

02:25:14.739 --> 02:25:17.175
HAVE TO PLAY. AND AS MUCH AS I

02:25:17.241 --> 02:25:17.942
ENJOY WORKING WITH NICOLE

02:25:18.009 --> 02:25:19.977
QUINONES ON MANY PROJECTS, THIS

02:25:20.044 --> 02:25:23.014
IS NOT ONE WHERE WE AGREE. SO I

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:24.749
JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE

02:25:24.816 --> 02:25:26.084
TO TO TAKE ACTION WHERE IT'S

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:27.218
APPROPRIATE, WHERE THE SCIENCE

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:28.786
IS CLEAR, THE HAZARD AND THE

02:25:28.853 --> 02:25:32.023
RISK IS CLEAR AND IT MAKES

02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:33.758
SENSE. AND IN THE MEANTIME, WE

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:35.059
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

02:25:35.126 --> 02:25:36.761
PROGRAM TO GET THEM TO BE AS

02:25:36.828 --> 02:25:40.465
EFFICIENT AND AS EFFECTIVE AS

02:25:40.531 --> 02:25:41.699
POSSIBLE. THANKS. THANK YOU.

02:25:41.766 --> 02:25:43.935
GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR

02:25:44.001 --> 02:25:45.470
THIS HEARING. MY NAME IS HEIDI

02:25:45.536 --> 02:25:46.037
SANBORN. I'M THE EXECUTIVE

02:25:46.104 --> 02:25:47.004
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:49.307
STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL, AND

02:25:49.373 --> 02:25:51.109
WE ADVOCATE FOR RESPONSIBLE

02:25:51.175 --> 02:25:51.876
CIRCULAR ECONOMY. I'VE BEEN A

02:25:51.943 --> 02:25:54.245
REGULATOR AT CALRECYCLE, A

02:25:54.312 --> 02:25:56.114
CONSULTANT AND AN ADVOCATE OF

02:25:56.180 --> 02:25:58.716
35 YEARS. AND I CAN SAY, YOU

02:25:58.783 --> 02:26:01.018
KNOW, NOW I REALLY FOCUS ON

02:26:01.085 --> 02:26:02.120
PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY,

02:26:02.186 --> 02:26:02.987
PARTICULARLY FOR HOUSEHOLD

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:04.689
HAZARDOUS WASTE IS OUR BIGGEST

02:26:04.755 --> 02:26:08.025
FOCUS NOW. AND DTSC HAS NOT HAD

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:09.694
A HISTORY OF WORKING WITH

02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:10.228
HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE.

02:26:10.294 --> 02:26:11.262
THEY'VE REALLY WORKED MOSTLY

02:26:11.329 --> 02:26:12.597
WITH INDUSTRIAL WASTE. AND SO

02:26:12.663 --> 02:26:13.865
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAS

02:26:13.931 --> 02:26:16.234
BEEN HISTORIC IS THE DIFFERENCE

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:16.634
BETWEEN CALRECYCLE

02:26:16.701 --> 02:26:17.668
RESPONSIBILITY AND DTSC

02:26:17.735 --> 02:26:18.903
RESPONSIBILITY. AND I THINK

02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:21.572
THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:22.740
STILL, BECAUSE CALRECYCLE HAS

02:26:22.807 --> 02:26:23.875
HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:26:23.941 --> 02:26:26.344
GRANTS, THEY DO SOME THINGS IN

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:26.911
OIL, THEY DO SOME THINGS IN

02:26:26.978 --> 02:26:29.280
THIS AREA. BUT YET DTSC IS

02:26:29.347 --> 02:26:30.114
ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE. WHO'S

02:26:30.181 --> 02:26:31.682
REALLY IN CHARGE OF THIS

02:26:31.749 --> 02:26:33.417
CATEGORY? I THINK THAT SHOULD

02:26:33.484 --> 02:26:35.052
BE FINALIZED AND MADE VERY

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:39.223
CLEAR TO EVERYONE. DTC IS BEEN

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:39.824
HISTORICALLY, ACCORDING TO ALL

02:26:39.891 --> 02:26:41.993
THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO, GETTING

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:43.561
PERMITS, VERY DIFFICULT AGENCY

02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:47.431
TO WORK WITH. THEY LACK OUT OF

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:47.899
THE BOX THINKING. THE

02:26:47.965 --> 02:26:49.901
REGULATORY PROCESS IS VERY TIME

02:26:49.967 --> 02:26:51.602
CONSUMING AND COSTLY, AND THE

02:26:51.669 --> 02:26:52.737
PERMITS TAKE FOREVER TO GET.

02:26:52.803 --> 02:26:54.939
AND WHAT THIS HAS LED TO IS

02:26:55.006 --> 02:26:56.207
THAT CALIFORNIA IS VERY POLICY

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:57.808
HEAVY, BUT WE DRIVE FACILITIES

02:26:57.875 --> 02:26:59.043
OUT OF STATE FOR RECYCLING AND

02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:00.978
MANAGING OUR OWN WASTE. AND I

02:27:01.045 --> 02:27:02.180
DON'T THINK THAT'S THE GOAL OF

02:27:02.246 --> 02:27:03.814
OUR STATE. AND WE'D LIKE TO

02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:05.483
KEEP THE JOBS HERE AS WELL,

02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:06.651
EVEN THOUGH I'D RATHER TURN OFF

02:27:06.717 --> 02:27:07.952
THE SPIGOT AND NOT HAVE ALL

02:27:08.019 --> 02:27:09.921
THIS HAZARDOUS WASTE TO BEGIN

02:27:09.987 --> 02:27:10.721
WITH. WHICH IS ANOTHER ONE OF

02:27:10.788 --> 02:27:12.857
MY COMMENTS, IS THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:27:12.924 --> 02:27:14.025
I REALLY THINK THE HAZARDOUS

02:27:14.091 --> 02:27:15.426
WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN DID NOT

02:27:15.493 --> 02:27:15.893
FOCUS ENOUGH ON SOURCE

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.828
REDUCTION AND ACTUALLY GETTING

02:27:17.895 --> 02:27:19.430
THE SPIGOT TURNED OFF, WHICH IS

02:27:19.497 --> 02:27:20.731
FAR MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN

02:27:20.798 --> 02:27:21.999
TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE MESS AND

02:27:22.066 --> 02:27:24.669
MOP. THEY ALSO, IN THE

02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:25.770
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN,

02:27:25.836 --> 02:27:26.938
HAVE A SUBTITLE OF A MODERN

02:27:27.004 --> 02:27:28.606
APPROACH TOWARDS A CIRCULAR

02:27:28.673 --> 02:27:29.874
ECONOMY. I HAD TO SAY AT THE

02:27:29.941 --> 02:27:31.842
PUBLIC HEARING IT IS NOT A

02:27:31.909 --> 02:27:33.110
CIRCULAR ECONOMY PLAN AT ALL.

02:27:33.177 --> 02:27:33.911
IN FACT, IT GIVES CIRCULAR

02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:35.947
ECONOMY A PLAN, A BAD NAME

02:27:36.013 --> 02:27:37.114
BECAUSE I ADVOCATE FOR CIRCULAR

02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:38.616
ECONOMY, WHICH IS THREE THINGS

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:39.951
SOURCE REDUCTION FIRST, THEN

02:27:40.017 --> 02:27:41.919
KEEP MATERIALS IN MOTION AND

02:27:41.986 --> 02:27:42.920
RECYCLE THEM, AND THEN DISPOSE

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:44.956
OF CLEAN UP NATURAL SYSTEMS AT

02:27:45.022 --> 02:27:47.792
END OF LIFE. AND THAT PLAN IS

02:27:47.858 --> 02:27:49.060
NOT ALL THOSE THINGS, AND IT'S

02:27:49.126 --> 02:27:50.561
CERTAINLY NOT ON PREVENTION.

02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:51.929
AND I CAN TELL YOU, WE TOOK

02:27:51.996 --> 02:27:53.064
STUDY TRIPS, THE RECYCLING

02:27:53.130 --> 02:27:54.599
CHALLENGE STUDY TRIPS, AND WE

02:27:54.665 --> 02:27:56.400
WENT TO CALGARY LAST YEAR AND

02:27:56.467 --> 02:27:57.902
SAW HOW THEY ACTUALLY CLEAN AND

02:27:57.969 --> 02:27:59.036
REMEDIATE SOILS AND PUT THEM

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:00.771
BACK OUT IN USE, NOT JUST

02:28:00.838 --> 02:28:01.906
LANDFILL THEM, WHICH IS

02:28:01.973 --> 02:28:02.873
SOMETHING I DIDN'T HEAR

02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:04.175
DISCUSSED AT ALL QUICKLY ON THE

02:28:04.242 --> 02:28:05.876
BILL. I WAS A SPONSOR WITH

02:28:05.943 --> 02:28:07.878
DOCTOR QUIRKE AND THAT WAS IN

02:28:07.945 --> 02:28:09.580
2022. WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH

02:28:09.647 --> 02:28:11.082
NICOLE QUINONES THAT WE NEED TO

02:28:11.148 --> 02:28:13.651
GET THAT TEST GOTTEN RID OF. WE

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:15.820
DON'T NEED TO KILL FISH AND

02:28:15.886 --> 02:28:17.088
SPEND ALL THE TIME DOING THAT

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:18.689
IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF THINGS

02:28:18.756 --> 02:28:19.890
ARE TOXIC, WE JUST NEED TO GET

02:28:19.957 --> 02:28:22.360
THE OTHER. I THINK IT'S 48

02:28:22.426 --> 02:28:22.827
STATES THAT HAVE THIS

02:28:22.893 --> 02:28:23.794
COMPUTATIONAL TOXICOLOGY. JUST

02:28:23.861 --> 02:28:25.096
COPY WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND DO

02:28:25.162 --> 02:28:26.197
IT OURSELVES. WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:28.165
ONE OF THE LAST STATES TO ADOPT

02:28:28.232 --> 02:28:29.800
THAT. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU

02:28:29.867 --> 02:28:31.669
VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT. HI.

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:33.738
GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS

02:28:33.804 --> 02:28:34.805
MELISSA BUMSTEAD AND I

02:28:34.872 --> 02:28:35.640
REPRESENT PARENTS AGAINST THE

02:28:35.706 --> 02:28:36.807
SANTA SUSANA FIELD LAB. IT'S

02:28:36.874 --> 02:28:38.809
HARD TO SEE BUT THAT'S MY

02:28:38.876 --> 02:28:40.144
DAUGHTER RIGHT THERE. AND THESE

02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:41.679
ARE SOME OF THE OTHER CHILDREN

02:28:41.746 --> 02:28:42.813
FROM MY COMMUNITY WHO HAVE

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:45.750
SUFFERED CANCER. I STARTED THE

02:28:45.816 --> 02:28:46.784
CHANGE.ORG PETITION FOR THE

02:28:46.851 --> 02:28:48.919
SSFL SANTA SUSANA FIELD LAB

02:28:48.986 --> 02:28:50.955
CLEANUP, WHICH NOW HAS OVER

02:28:51.022 --> 02:28:52.790
760,000 SIGNATURES. I'M HERE

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:54.392
TODAY BECAUSE MY COMMUNITY,

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:55.826
VERY FORTUNATELY, WAS ABLE TO

02:28:55.893 --> 02:28:58.362
RAISE THE FUNDS TO SEND ME, AND

02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:59.563
I REALIZED MY TESTIMONY IS

02:28:59.630 --> 02:29:00.731
COSTING MY COMMUNITY ABOUT $300

02:29:00.798 --> 02:29:03.534
A MINUTE. SO I WILL KEEP MY

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:04.669
COMMENTS AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE.

02:29:04.735 --> 02:29:07.104
I WAS I'LL SAY QUICKLY THAT I

02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:08.673
WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS IS

02:29:08.739 --> 02:29:11.042
NOT A HYBRID MEETING, AS IT

02:29:11.108 --> 02:29:12.576
DISQUALIFIES MANY COMMUNITY

02:29:12.643 --> 02:29:14.111
MEMBERS FROM SHARING THEIR

02:29:14.178 --> 02:29:16.147
PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE DTSC,

02:29:16.213 --> 02:29:17.581
WHICH WE ARE HEAVILY IMPACTED

02:29:17.648 --> 02:29:18.883
BY. AND WE ARE ALSO

02:29:18.949 --> 02:29:20.918
OVERBURDENED WITH MEDICAL COSTS.

02:29:20.985 --> 02:29:23.454
BUT MY COMMUNITY HAS

02:29:23.521 --> 02:29:24.088
PRIORITIZED ME BEING HERE TODAY

02:29:24.155 --> 02:29:25.923
TO HAVE A VOICE FOR OUR

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:27.992
COMMUNITY. THE DTSC CONTINUES

02:29:28.059 --> 02:29:29.126
TO STAUNCHLY UPHOLD THEIR

02:29:29.193 --> 02:29:30.628
CLAIMS THAT CONTAMINATION FROM

02:29:30.695 --> 02:29:31.996
THE SANTA SUSANA FIELD LAB,

02:29:32.063 --> 02:29:33.397
WHICH IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:34.598
MOST TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE

02:29:34.665 --> 02:29:36.834
SITES, DOES NOT COME OFF SITE.

02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:38.135
AND IF IT DOES, IT IS INCAPABLE

02:29:38.202 --> 02:29:39.937
OF HARMING THE RESIDENTS.

02:29:40.004 --> 02:29:41.806
DESPITE THEIR OWN RESEARCH,

02:29:41.872 --> 02:29:43.207
INDEPENDENT STUDIES AND DATA

02:29:43.274 --> 02:29:44.675
FROM SISTER AGENCIES. AS I

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:45.776
MENTIONED, MY DAUGHTER IS ONE

02:29:45.843 --> 02:29:47.178
OF MORE THAN 80 CHILDREN THAT

02:29:47.244 --> 02:29:48.779
WE KNOW OF, AND THAT'S JUST

02:29:48.846 --> 02:29:50.815
SELF-REPORTED DATA THAT HAVE

02:29:50.881 --> 02:29:51.916
DEVELOPED EXCEPTIONALLY RARE

02:29:51.982 --> 02:29:53.818
AND AGGRESSIVE CANCERS, WHO ARE

02:29:53.884 --> 02:29:56.087
LIVING ONLY WITHIN MILES OF THE

02:29:56.153 --> 02:29:57.822
SITE. CHILDREN AND ADULTS ARE

02:29:57.888 --> 02:29:59.990
BEING HARMED. STILL, LAST WEEK

02:30:00.057 --> 02:30:01.092
I LEARNED OF THREE MORE

02:30:01.158 --> 02:30:02.626
CHILDREN IN MY COMMUNITY WHO

02:30:02.693 --> 02:30:04.428
WERE RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH

02:30:04.495 --> 02:30:05.830
EXCEPTIONALLY RARE AND ALMOST

02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:08.399
ALWAYS FATAL CANCERS. INSTEAD

02:30:08.466 --> 02:30:09.834
OF PRIORITIZING THE CLEANUP,

02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:11.736
DTSC MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTION

02:30:11.802 --> 02:30:13.771
FOR THE SANTA SUSANA FIELD LAB

02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:15.740
LAST YEAR WAS SECURING $2

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:18.142
MILLION NOT FOR REMEDIATION,

02:30:18.209 --> 02:30:19.643
BUT TO DEFEND ITSELF IN COURT

02:30:19.710 --> 02:30:21.245
FROM MY COMMUNITY'S LAWSUIT.

02:30:21.312 --> 02:30:23.914
DTSC VIOLATED CEQA BY APPROVING

02:30:23.981 --> 02:30:25.116
A DEAL THAT ALLOWS BOEING TO

02:30:25.182 --> 02:30:26.784
LEAVE MORE THAN 90% OF THE

02:30:26.851 --> 02:30:28.919
CONTAMINATION IN PLACE ON SITE,

02:30:28.986 --> 02:30:30.054
PERMANENTLY NEAR OUR HOMES.

02:30:30.121 --> 02:30:31.989
THEY INTEND TO OPEN IT AS A

02:30:32.056 --> 02:30:34.125
PUBLIC PARK AFTER. WE HOPE THAT

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:36.193
A RULING IN OUR FAVOR WILL GIVE

02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:37.161
US AGAIN THE COMPLETE CLEANUP

02:30:37.228 --> 02:30:39.096
THAT WE HAVE WAITED NEARLY TWO

02:30:39.163 --> 02:30:40.865
DECADES FOR. MY COMMUNITY'S

02:30:40.931 --> 02:30:43.067
VOICE IS EXCLUDED FROM DTZ'S

02:30:43.134 --> 02:30:44.969
DECISION MAKING. WE COME TO ALL

02:30:45.035 --> 02:30:46.971
THE HEARINGS, WE JUMP THROUGH

02:30:47.037 --> 02:30:48.906
EVERY HOOP. WE WE CROSS OUR T'S,

02:30:48.973 --> 02:30:51.442
WE DOT OUR I'S. STILL, WE ARE

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:53.944
NOT BEING PART OF A MEANINGFUL

02:30:54.011 --> 02:30:54.945
CHANGE WITHIN THIS CLEANUP

02:30:55.012 --> 02:30:58.015
PROCESS. INDEPENDENT AND PEER

02:30:58.082 --> 02:30:59.116
REVIEWED SCIENCE IS ALWAYS

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:00.918
DISMISSED IN FAVOR OF STUDIES

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.686
PAID FOR BY THE RESPONSIBLE

02:31:02.753 --> 02:31:03.988
PARTIES, WHICH PROTECT PROFIT

02:31:04.054 --> 02:31:06.090
OVER PEOPLE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:31:06.157 --> 02:31:07.691
SAFETY HAS CREATED A

02:31:07.758 --> 02:31:08.959
SUBCOMMITTEE TO LISTEN TO US,

02:31:09.026 --> 02:31:10.661
AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR

02:31:10.728 --> 02:31:11.829
THEIR TIME. BUT THE B.S. HAS

02:31:11.896 --> 02:31:13.831
MINIMAL POWER TO ACT. THAT IS

02:31:13.898 --> 02:31:15.099
WHY OUR COMMUNITY IS SUING THE

02:31:15.166 --> 02:31:16.901
DTSC. AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE

02:31:16.967 --> 02:31:18.936
TODAY, BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY FEW

02:31:19.003 --> 02:31:21.772
OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE OUR OUR

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:23.474
CRIES HEARD FOR JUSTICE AND

02:31:23.541 --> 02:31:24.809
PROTECTION. SO I WOULD URGE

02:31:24.875 --> 02:31:27.912
THIS COMMITTEE TO HOLD REGULAR

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:29.447
COMMUNITY COMMUNITY HEARINGS ON

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:31.982
DTSC REFORM ONCE A YEAR IS

02:31:32.049 --> 02:31:34.218
TOUGH FOR US. I MEAN, WE WE DO

02:31:34.285 --> 02:31:35.920
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BE HERE. I

02:31:35.986 --> 02:31:38.055
WAS ALSO TOLD BY OUR STAFF LAST

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:39.023
YEAR WHEN WE MISSED THE MEETING,

02:31:39.089 --> 02:31:40.925
THEY HAD NO RESOURCES TO CREATE

02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:42.593
AN EMAIL LIST FOR US TO BE

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:43.761
ALERTED ABOUT THESE HEARINGS.

02:31:43.828 --> 02:31:46.130
IT WAS NOT PUT ON DTSC OR THE

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:46.797
BHS WEBSITE, SO WE WERE VERY

02:31:46.864 --> 02:31:47.998
FORTUNATE TO FIND OUT ABOUT

02:31:48.065 --> 02:31:49.633
THIS MEETING. FOUND OUT ABOUT

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.101
IT MONDAY. MY COMMUNITY HAD

02:31:51.168 --> 02:31:52.970
RAISED THE FUNDS BY TUESDAY AND

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:55.206
I WAS HERE. I WOULD ALSO ASK

02:31:55.272 --> 02:31:56.207
THAT A HYBRID PARTICIPATION

02:31:56.273 --> 02:31:57.908
OPTION BE INCLUDED BECAUSE AS

02:31:57.975 --> 02:32:00.010
FAR AS I CAN TELL, I SEE ONE

02:32:00.077 --> 02:32:01.679
OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBER THAT I

02:32:01.745 --> 02:32:03.547
RECOGNIZE WHO ACTUALLY LIVED

02:32:03.614 --> 02:32:04.148
NEAR THESE CONTAMINATED SITES.

02:32:04.215 --> 02:32:05.983
IT IS VERY HARD FOR US TO BE

02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:09.253
HERE. I WOULD ALSO ASK THAT THE

02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:10.721
BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY'S

02:32:10.788 --> 02:32:12.890
PURVIEW BE WIDELY EXPANDED TO

02:32:12.957 --> 02:32:14.191
GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO

02:32:14.258 --> 02:32:18.295
ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE

02:32:18.362 --> 02:32:18.929
LIKE THE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL

02:32:18.996 --> 02:32:20.898
SAFETY. WE FEEL THAT THEY HAVE

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:23.367
A GOOD, INDEPENDENT PERSPECTIVE

02:32:23.434 --> 02:32:24.835
ON WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE

02:32:24.902 --> 02:32:26.070
DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE

02:32:26.136 --> 02:32:27.505
CONTROL, BUT THEY HAVE VERY

02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:28.873
LITTLE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THOSE

02:32:28.939 --> 02:32:31.275
CHANGES, AT LEAST FROM FROM MY

02:32:31.342 --> 02:32:32.743
COMMUNITY'S PERSPECTIVE. AND

02:32:32.810 --> 02:32:34.778
ONE THING THAT WOULD BE

02:32:34.845 --> 02:32:36.347
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL FOR MY

02:32:36.413 --> 02:32:36.981
COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITIES LIKE

02:32:37.047 --> 02:32:39.850
MINE, IS TO REQUIRE THE DTSC TO

02:32:39.917 --> 02:32:41.018
CREATE A PORTAL SO THAT

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:43.187
INDEPENDENT EXPERTS CAN SUBMIT

02:32:43.254 --> 02:32:44.154
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES AND REVIEWS

02:32:44.221 --> 02:32:45.823
THAT HAVE TO BE INCORPORATED

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:47.892
INTO THE DATA SET OF THE DTSC.

02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:50.394
FOR EXAMPLE, THE WATER BOARD

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:52.830
HAS. BOEING HAS HAD OVER $1

02:32:52.897 --> 02:32:54.798
MILLION OF FINES FOR POLLUTING

02:32:54.865 --> 02:32:57.768
THE LA RIVER. BUT EVEN THOUGH

02:32:57.835 --> 02:32:59.603
IT IS A SISTER AGENCY, THE DTSC

02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:01.805
IS ABLE TO SAY THAT

02:33:01.872 --> 02:33:02.973
CONTAMINATION DOES NOT COME OFF

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:03.841
SITE. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE LED

02:33:03.908 --> 02:33:06.911
12 TIMES THE LEGAL LIMITS

02:33:06.977 --> 02:33:08.679
COMING INTO THE LA RIVER FROM

02:33:08.746 --> 02:33:09.813
THE SANTA SUSANA FIELD LAB, THE

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:11.181
DTSC IS ACTING AS AN

02:33:11.248 --> 02:33:12.683
INDEPENDENT WORLD COUNTRY. THEY

02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:16.253
THEY DO NOT. THERE'S VERY

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:17.788
LITTLE AUTHORITY TO GET THEM TO

02:33:17.855 --> 02:33:20.324
CHANGE COURSE IN A MEANINGFUL

02:33:20.391 --> 02:33:21.191
WAY. THEY DO NOT INCORPORATE

02:33:21.258 --> 02:33:22.893
INDEPENDENT DATA, PEER REVIEWED

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.795
DATA, FEDERALLY FUNDED DATA.

02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:26.130
THEY DON'T EVEN INCORPORATE

02:33:26.196 --> 02:33:28.766
SISTER AGENCY DATA. SO THAT IS

02:33:28.832 --> 02:33:30.100
HARD FOR ME AS A COMMUNITY

02:33:30.167 --> 02:33:31.735
MEMBER TO TRY TO GET THEM TO

02:33:31.802 --> 02:33:32.937
CHANGE COURSE ON THESE CLEANUP

02:33:33.003 --> 02:33:34.004
PLANS WHEN THEY WON'T

02:33:34.071 --> 02:33:35.172
INCORPORATE DATA, EXCEPT IF

02:33:35.239 --> 02:33:38.142
IT'S PAID FOR BY THE POLLUTERS.

02:33:38.208 --> 02:33:39.643
SO A PORTAL FOR INDEPENDENT

02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:41.812
DATA WOULD BE A HUGE,

02:33:41.879 --> 02:33:42.980
MEANINGFUL CHANGE FOR MY

02:33:43.047 --> 02:33:44.915
COMMUNITY. WITHOUT THESE

02:33:44.982 --> 02:33:45.950
REFORMS, OUR CHILDREN WILL

02:33:46.016 --> 02:33:47.985
CONTINUE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR

02:33:48.052 --> 02:33:50.120
DTZ'S FAILURES. THANK YOU FOR

02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:54.358
ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. GOOD

02:33:54.425 --> 02:33:56.827
MORNING CHAIRS. CHRISTINE WOLF

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:58.629
WITH W.M. FORMERLY WASTE

02:33:58.696 --> 02:34:00.831
MANAGEMENT. WE OWN AND OPERATE

02:34:00.898 --> 02:34:02.132
THE KETTLEMAN HILLS FACILITY,

02:34:02.199 --> 02:34:04.068
ONE OF THE TWO HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:34:04.134 --> 02:34:06.503
LANDFILLS IN CALIFORNIA. SO

02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:06.971
WE'RE REGULATED BY THE

02:34:07.037 --> 02:34:09.907
DEPARTMENT AND HAVE SEEN A LOT

02:34:09.974 --> 02:34:10.708
OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

02:34:10.774 --> 02:34:11.942
DEPARTMENT OVER THE LAST COUPLE

02:34:12.009 --> 02:34:14.912
OF YEARS, BOTH SINCE SB 158 WAS

02:34:14.979 --> 02:34:17.848
ENACTED, AS WELL AS THE

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:18.916
APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTOR BUTLER.

02:34:18.983 --> 02:34:20.684
SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE

02:34:20.751 --> 02:34:22.820
MOVING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION,

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:25.756
BUT JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF

02:34:25.823 --> 02:34:26.991
DON'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEED

02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:29.093
FOR THE COMMITTEES, POTENTIALLY

02:34:29.159 --> 02:34:31.195
TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:34:31.261 --> 02:34:32.663
WE'RE HAVING ONGOING

02:34:32.730 --> 02:34:34.698
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE LONG

02:34:34.765 --> 02:34:35.866
TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY OF

02:34:35.933 --> 02:34:38.268
THE DEPARTMENT. I THINK WE'RE

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:40.771
SERIOUSLY CONCERNED, AS THE

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:43.007
LARGEST FACILITY FEE PAYER IN

02:34:43.073 --> 02:34:44.575
THE STATE, WE PAY OVER $1

02:34:44.642 --> 02:34:47.745
MILLION A YEAR TO DTSC. WE ALSO

02:34:47.811 --> 02:34:48.846
HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT COSTS

02:34:48.912 --> 02:34:50.914
RELATED TO THE PERMIT AND

02:34:50.981 --> 02:34:52.182
COMPLIANCE, WHICH WE TAKE VERY

02:34:52.249 --> 02:34:53.917
SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE THE BEST

02:34:53.984 --> 02:34:55.586
COMPLIANCE SCORE OF ANY

02:34:55.653 --> 02:34:56.754
FACILITY REGULATED BY DTSC IN

02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:59.957
THE STATE, AND ARE PROUD OF OUR

02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:00.658
ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD AND

02:35:00.724 --> 02:35:02.192
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND

02:35:02.259 --> 02:35:04.094
PROVIDING A SAFE, IN-STATE

02:35:04.161 --> 02:35:05.629
LOCATION FOR DISPOSAL OF

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:06.930
HAZARDOUS WASTE. AND I THINK

02:35:06.997 --> 02:35:08.699
THAT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:10.034
PART OF IMPLEMENTING THE

02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:11.735
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

02:35:11.802 --> 02:35:13.003
AND ENSURING THAT DTSC CAN BE

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:16.306
SUCCESSFUL. BUT RECOGNIZING

02:35:16.373 --> 02:35:17.574
THAT THE GENERATION AND

02:35:17.641 --> 02:35:19.243
HANDLING FEE IN PARTICULAR, HAS

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:22.046
BEEN A POINT OF CONSTERNATION

02:35:22.112 --> 02:35:23.747
FOR A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS,

02:35:23.814 --> 02:35:25.849
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE

02:35:25.916 --> 02:35:27.918
ASKS FOR EXEMPTIONS FROM THE

02:35:27.985 --> 02:35:29.753
GENERATION AND HANDLING FEE TO

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:31.822
LOOK AT THAT MORE HOLISTICALLY,

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:34.425
THAT IT MAY HAVE IMPACTS ON

02:35:34.491 --> 02:35:35.459
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND

02:35:35.526 --> 02:35:37.127
RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT IN

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:39.329
THE STATE, REALLY ENCOURAGE THE

02:35:39.396 --> 02:35:41.665
DEPARTMENT, THE THE LEGISLATURE

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:43.300
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

02:35:43.367 --> 02:35:45.035
ONGOING CONVERSATIONS SO THAT

02:35:45.102 --> 02:35:46.870
WE KNOW THAT IF THERE ARE

02:35:46.937 --> 02:35:49.073
CHANGES TO THE FEE STRUCTURE

02:35:49.139 --> 02:35:50.674
THAT THE EXISTING FEE PAYERS

02:35:50.741 --> 02:35:51.942
AREN'T, DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ON

02:35:52.009 --> 02:35:53.911
THE BURDEN OF THOSE FEES,

02:35:53.977 --> 02:35:54.511
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE

02:35:54.578 --> 02:35:55.913
FOR THE LONG RUN, PARTICULARLY

02:35:55.979 --> 02:35:57.481
FOR A LOT OF THE AMBITIOUS

02:35:57.548 --> 02:35:58.982
PROGRAMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:35:59.049 --> 02:35:59.917
WANTS TO UNDERTAKE AS OUTLINED

02:35:59.983 --> 02:36:02.619
IN THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:36:02.686 --> 02:36:03.754
MANAGEMENT PLAN. SO THANK YOU

02:36:03.821 --> 02:36:08.225
VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING, JOHN

02:36:08.292 --> 02:36:10.094
KENNEDY. WITH THE RURAL COUNTY

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:10.794
REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA,

02:36:10.861 --> 02:36:13.564
WE REPRESENT 40 OF THE STATE'S

02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:16.934
58 COUNTIES AND OUR MEMBERS, AS

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:17.901
WELL AS THE OTHER COUNTIES,

02:36:17.968 --> 02:36:20.170
OPERATE ALMOST 200 HOUSEHOLD

02:36:20.237 --> 02:36:20.704
HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:23.340
FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

02:36:23.407 --> 02:36:25.209
WHERE WE TAKE A SUBSET THAT'S

02:36:25.275 --> 02:36:27.311
NOT SUBJECT TO FEDERAL

02:36:27.377 --> 02:36:28.846
REGULATIONS AND TRY AND

02:36:28.912 --> 02:36:30.581
PROPERLY MANAGE AND DISPOSE OF

02:36:30.647 --> 02:36:33.884
THOSE COMMODITIES. DTSC IS IN A

02:36:33.951 --> 02:36:34.818
VERY TOUGH POSITION AND

02:36:34.885 --> 02:36:36.887
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX REGULATORY

02:36:36.954 --> 02:36:38.989
ENVIRONMENT WITH DIFFERENT

02:36:39.056 --> 02:36:40.991
FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY

02:36:41.058 --> 02:36:42.793
REQUIREMENTS. SOMETIMES WE

02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:44.461
DON'T MAKE THINGS EASY FOR

02:36:44.528 --> 02:36:45.729
OURSELVES. SOME OF THE

02:36:45.796 --> 02:36:48.232
CHALLENGES THAT THAT WE FACE,

02:36:48.298 --> 02:36:49.733
AS YOU HEARD, AND OVER

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:50.868
CATEGORIZATION OF WHAT

02:36:50.934 --> 02:36:52.269
CONSTITUTES HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS

02:36:52.336 --> 02:36:53.837
WASTE. SO I AGREE, WE NEED TO

02:36:53.904 --> 02:36:56.273
GO BACK AND LOOK AT PAST

02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:57.040
REFINEMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:36:57.107 --> 02:36:59.042
OUR TOOTHPASTES, OUR SHAMPOOS

02:36:59.109 --> 02:36:59.710
AND OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:36:59.777 --> 02:37:00.978
AREN'T REGULATED AS HAZARDOUS

02:37:01.044 --> 02:37:03.046
WASTE WHEN WE APPLY THEM TO OUR

02:37:03.113 --> 02:37:04.848
BODIES. THE COSTS THAT WE FACE

02:37:04.915 --> 02:37:06.884
AS HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:09.086
FACILITIES ARE EXORBITANT.

02:37:09.153 --> 02:37:10.287
OFTENTIMES, WE'LL HAVE TO

02:37:10.354 --> 02:37:12.790
TRANSPORT OUR MATERIALS OUT OF

02:37:12.856 --> 02:37:13.957
STATE HALFWAY ACROSS THE

02:37:14.024 --> 02:37:15.292
COUNTRY FOR PROPER MANAGEMENT,

02:37:15.359 --> 02:37:18.228
DISPOSAL. SOMETIMES THE COST OF

02:37:18.295 --> 02:37:19.129
MANAGING THOSE PRODUCTS REACHES

02:37:19.196 --> 02:37:20.798
OR EXCEEDS THE COST OF THE

02:37:20.864 --> 02:37:22.933
CONSUMERS AT THE RETAIL SALE,

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.569
ESPECIALLY FOR KNOX CYLINDERS,

02:37:25.636 --> 02:37:26.703
SOMETHING THAT MAY COST 30 TO

02:37:26.770 --> 02:37:28.639
$40 ONLINE ON AMAZON WILL COST

02:37:28.705 --> 02:37:30.240
US 60 TO $70 TO MANAGE THE

02:37:30.307 --> 02:37:32.075
EMPTY CONTAINER AT THE END OF

02:37:32.142 --> 02:37:33.644
ITS USEFUL LIFE. ADDITIONALLY,

02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:34.778
WE'VE GOT REALLY COMPLEX

02:37:34.845 --> 02:37:37.281
MANAGEMENT STANDARDS AND

02:37:37.347 --> 02:37:39.683
REQUIREMENTS. A COUPLE EXAMPLES

02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:40.951
TREATED WOOD WASTE. THIS WAS A

02:37:41.018 --> 02:37:42.920
STRUGGLE WE DEALT WITH SEVERAL

02:37:42.986 --> 02:37:43.754
YEARS AGO. HAVEN'T HAD THE

02:37:43.821 --> 02:37:46.089
ISSUES THAT WE HAD BACK THEN

02:37:46.156 --> 02:37:47.057
WITH VETOED LEGISLATION.

02:37:47.124 --> 02:37:49.827
RESTRICTIONS ON WHEN THESE

02:37:49.893 --> 02:37:51.128
MATERIALS CAN COME IN CONTACT

02:37:51.195 --> 02:37:53.096
WITH THE GROUND. WE'RE TALKING

02:37:53.163 --> 02:37:54.765
FENCE POSTS, MATERIALS THAT ARE

02:37:54.832 --> 02:37:56.700
EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND FOR 30,

02:37:56.767 --> 02:37:58.235
40 YEARS SOMETIMES. AND YET AS

02:37:58.302 --> 02:37:59.570
FACILITIES, WE ARE PRECLUDED

02:37:59.636 --> 02:38:01.705
FROM HAVING THEM COME INTO

02:38:01.772 --> 02:38:02.873
CONTACT WITH THE GROUND. WE'RE

02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:04.975
LIMITED ON HOW LONG THOSE

02:38:05.042 --> 02:38:06.777
MATERIALS CAN BE MANAGED ON

02:38:06.844 --> 02:38:08.846
SITE. AND THANKFULLY, WE NOW

02:38:08.912 --> 02:38:10.147
HAVE ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT

02:38:10.214 --> 02:38:10.747
STANDARDS THAT WERE RECREATED

02:38:10.814 --> 02:38:12.816
THROUGH SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE

02:38:12.883 --> 02:38:14.084
PROCESSES. SO THANK YOU FOR THE

02:38:14.151 --> 02:38:16.753
COMMITTEE ON THAT. ADDITIONALLY,

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:17.888
REQUIREMENTS ON TREATMENT OF

02:38:17.955 --> 02:38:19.122
HAZARDOUS WASTE, HOUSEHOLD

02:38:19.189 --> 02:38:22.125
HAZARDOUS WASTE, REALLY

02:38:22.192 --> 02:38:23.560
ANYTHING THAT PHYSICALLY

02:38:23.627 --> 02:38:24.194
CHANGES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF

02:38:24.261 --> 02:38:27.264
THAT HAZARDOUS WASTE IS

02:38:27.331 --> 02:38:28.065
DETERMINED TO BE TREATMENT

02:38:28.131 --> 02:38:29.933
WHICH REQUIRES SPECIAL PERMITS.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.069
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THAT

02:38:32.135 --> 02:38:32.836
EXTENDS TO THINGS AS SIMPLE AS

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:34.972
CUTTING A CORD ON AN ELECTRONIC

02:38:35.038 --> 02:38:36.206
DEVICE, REMOVING BATTERIES THAT

02:38:36.273 --> 02:38:37.641
ARE EMBEDDED IN PRODUCTS. THESE

02:38:37.708 --> 02:38:39.209
ARE COMMON SENSE THINGS THAT WE

02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:41.612
CAN DO AS H.W. COLLECTION

02:38:41.678 --> 02:38:42.880
FACILITIES SAFELY, WITH PROPER

02:38:42.946 --> 02:38:44.848
TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT BY LEAS

02:38:44.915 --> 02:38:46.550
WHERE WE CAN HELP DTSC ACHIEVE

02:38:46.617 --> 02:38:48.886
SOME OF THEIR AMBITIOUS

02:38:48.952 --> 02:38:50.554
REQUIREMENTS FOR REDUCING THE

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:53.357
AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT'S DISPOSED.

02:38:53.423 --> 02:38:54.124
INCREASING RECYCLING, THINGS

02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:56.727
LIKE THAT. SO I AGREE WITH

02:38:56.793 --> 02:38:57.895
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. WE HOPE

02:38:57.961 --> 02:38:59.429
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

02:38:59.496 --> 02:39:00.063
CONVERSATIONS WITH REGULATORS,

02:39:00.130 --> 02:39:02.833
WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH THE

02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:04.101
LEGISLATURE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE

02:39:04.167 --> 02:39:05.102
AND REALLY FACILITATE SOME

02:39:05.168 --> 02:39:07.170
CREATIVE THINKING TO IMPROVE

02:39:07.237 --> 02:39:07.671
MANAGEMENT AND INCREASE

02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:09.172
RECYCLING AND REDUCE DISPOSAL

02:39:09.239 --> 02:39:10.941
OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. THANK YOU

02:39:11.008 --> 02:39:17.748
VERY MUCH. HELLO, I'M ALIYA

02:39:17.814 --> 02:39:20.150
CRUTCHER WITH COMMUNITIES FOR A

02:39:20.217 --> 02:39:20.717
BETTER ENVIRONMENT. WE'RE A

02:39:20.784 --> 02:39:21.919
COMMUNITY BASED ENVIRONMENTAL

02:39:21.985 --> 02:39:24.054
JUSTICE ORGANIZATION. AND SINCE

02:39:24.121 --> 02:39:26.690
THE PASSAGE OF SB 158, DTSC HAS

02:39:26.757 --> 02:39:27.925
NOT MADE GOOD ON THEIR

02:39:27.991 --> 02:39:29.526
COMMITMENTS TO OUR COMMUNITY

02:39:29.593 --> 02:39:31.628
MEMBERS. I WORK DIRECTLY WITH

02:39:31.695 --> 02:39:33.263
RESIDENTS WHO LIVE RIGHT NEXT

02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:34.564
TO THE EXIDE FACILITY. I ALSO

02:39:34.631 --> 02:39:36.133
WORK WITH RESIDENTS WHO LIVE

02:39:36.199 --> 02:39:37.768
RIGHT NEXT TO A FORMER METAL

02:39:37.834 --> 02:39:39.603
RECYCLER IN SOUTHGATE IN LA.

02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:40.938
THESE RESIDENTS ORGANIZED FOR

02:39:41.004 --> 02:39:43.206
YEARS TO SHUT DOWN THE METAL

02:39:43.273 --> 02:39:44.074
RECYCLER BECAUSE OF EXTREMELY

02:39:44.141 --> 02:39:45.876
HIGH LEVELS OF ARSENIC AND LEAD,

02:39:45.943 --> 02:39:47.077
WERE LEACHED INTO THAT

02:39:47.144 --> 02:39:48.679
COMMUNITY. FINALLY, IT WAS SHUT

02:39:48.745 --> 02:39:51.548
DOWN AND DTSC WAS TASKED WITH

02:39:51.615 --> 02:39:53.717
THE CLEANUP UNDER SB 158. FROM

02:39:53.784 --> 02:39:55.886
A COMMUNITY STANDPOINT, WE'RE

02:39:55.953 --> 02:39:57.621
THINKING, OKAY, WE HAVE THIS

02:39:57.688 --> 02:39:58.889
LEGISLATION, WE HAVE THE BEES,

02:39:58.956 --> 02:40:00.924
AND WE HAVE NEW JACK TO

02:40:00.991 --> 02:40:02.159
FACILITATE A CLEANUP THAT'S

02:40:02.225 --> 02:40:04.061
CONSIDERATE OF THE COMMUNITY.

02:40:04.127 --> 02:40:05.929
INSTEAD, ALL WE GOT WAS AN

02:40:05.996 --> 02:40:07.397
EXTREMELY LIMITED AND

02:40:07.464 --> 02:40:08.699
SPECULATIVE CLEANUP PLAN THAT

02:40:08.765 --> 02:40:11.301
FAILED TO CONSIDER ANY OF OUR

02:40:11.368 --> 02:40:12.769
COMMUNITY COMMENTS. THEN WE GET

02:40:12.836 --> 02:40:13.904
DTSC DECIDING TO FILE AN

02:40:13.971 --> 02:40:15.772
EXEMPTION FROM SEQUA, LIMITING

02:40:15.839 --> 02:40:17.741
PROPER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW,

02:40:17.808 --> 02:40:19.409
AND SHUTTING OUR COMMUNITY OUT

02:40:19.476 --> 02:40:21.712
OF THE PROCESS. THE PROCESS BY

02:40:21.778 --> 02:40:23.814
WHICH A METAL RECYCLER IS BEING

02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:24.982
REPLACED WITH A STORAGE

02:40:25.048 --> 02:40:25.782
FACILITY AND POLLUTING AUTO

02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:27.884
REPAIR SHOP FOR LARGE TRUCKS.

02:40:27.951 --> 02:40:29.953
WE'VE GOTTEN FLUFF LANGUAGE

02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:31.922
FROM DTSC IN MEETINGS AND IN

02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:33.657
THE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT

02:40:33.724 --> 02:40:34.691
PLAN ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL

02:40:34.758 --> 02:40:36.360
JUSTICE, BUT ON THE GROUND,

02:40:36.426 --> 02:40:38.295
WE'VE ONLY GOTTEN THE STATUS

02:40:38.362 --> 02:40:44.801
QUO. THANK YOU. HI, I'M SCOTT

JUSTICE ORGANIZATION. JUST

02:40:52.776 --> 02:40:55.912
WANTED TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT A

02:40:55.979 --> 02:40:58.949
CLASS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE THAT'S

02:40:59.016 --> 02:41:00.017
ACTUALLY NOT CONSIDERED

02:41:00.083 --> 02:41:02.552
HAZARDOUS WASTE, WHICH IS A

02:41:02.619 --> 02:41:04.588
METAL SHREDDER FEEDSTOCK.

02:41:04.654 --> 02:41:07.891
CURRENTLY IS EXEMPT THROUGH AN

02:41:07.958 --> 02:41:09.626
F LETTER THAT WAS CREATED

02:41:09.693 --> 02:41:12.829
DECADES AGO BY THE INDUSTRY

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:13.663
SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT A

02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:16.366
HAZARDOUS WASTE BECAUSE THIS

02:41:16.433 --> 02:41:19.002
HAS VALUE. BUT JUST AS WASTE

02:41:19.069 --> 02:41:21.138
WATER HAS VALUE THESE DAYS,

02:41:21.204 --> 02:41:22.305
METHANE, FERTILIZER, OTHER

02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:25.809
THINGS, WASTEWATER IS CERTAINLY

02:41:25.876 --> 02:41:26.877
CONSIDERED A HAZARDOUS WASTE.

02:41:26.943 --> 02:41:30.013
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE METAL

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:31.882
SHREDDER FEEDSTOCK SHOULD BE

02:41:31.948 --> 02:41:32.582
CONSIDERED A HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:41:32.649 --> 02:41:35.252
AND TREATED AS SUCH. AND

02:41:35.318 --> 02:41:36.720
THERE'S CURRENTLY A BILL GOING

02:41:36.787 --> 02:41:39.056
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE, SB 404,

02:41:39.122 --> 02:41:41.625
THAT WOULD PERMANENTLY GIVE

02:41:41.691 --> 02:41:42.959
THIS EXEMPTION TO THIS INDUSTRY

02:41:43.026 --> 02:41:45.629
THAT IS KNOWN TO BE HIGHLY

02:41:45.695 --> 02:41:47.764
POLLUTING, HANDLE HAZARDOUS

02:41:47.831 --> 02:41:50.233
WASTE, AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE

02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:52.836
THIS FEEDSTOCK TREATED AS SUCH

02:41:52.903 --> 02:41:53.970
WHEN IT'S TRANSPORTED TO THE

02:41:54.037 --> 02:41:56.206
FACILITY HELD AT THE FACILITY

02:41:56.273 --> 02:41:57.908
AND TREATED AT THE FACILITY.

02:41:57.974 --> 02:42:03.213
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIR AND

02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:03.747
MEMBERS, JERRY DESMOND, ON

02:42:03.814 --> 02:42:05.082
BEHALF OF RECREATIONAL BOATERS

02:42:05.148 --> 02:42:07.250
OF CALIFORNIA, JUST TO

02:42:07.317 --> 02:42:09.019
EMPHASIZE WHAT ONE OF THE

02:42:09.086 --> 02:42:09.920
ISSUES THAT THE CHAIR MENTIONED

02:42:09.986 --> 02:42:11.054
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING

02:42:11.121 --> 02:42:12.656
ARE THE CHALLENGES OF EPR IN

02:42:12.722 --> 02:42:14.758
SPECIFIC SITUATIONS, SUCH AS

02:42:14.825 --> 02:42:17.627
MARINE FLARES, AND TO ENCOURAGE

02:42:17.694 --> 02:42:18.695
CONSIDERATION OF WAYS TO

02:42:18.762 --> 02:42:20.964
EXPEDITE THE PROCESS IN

02:42:21.031 --> 02:42:22.632
SITUATIONS WHERE, LIKE MARINE

02:42:22.699 --> 02:42:25.435
FLARES, THERE'S PROBABLY ONE

02:42:25.502 --> 02:42:26.036
MANUFACTURER. IT'S EXPLOSIVE.

02:42:26.103 --> 02:42:28.338
IT HAS TO GO TO ANOTHER STATE

02:42:28.405 --> 02:42:31.675
OR THE COSTS GO UP ON ON THE

02:42:31.741 --> 02:42:32.876
STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE TO USE

02:42:32.943 --> 02:42:34.945
OR WANT TO USE THOSE FLARES FOR

02:42:35.011 --> 02:42:36.680
SAFETY OUT ON THE WATER. AND

02:42:36.746 --> 02:42:37.914
WE'RE HOPING THAT PERHAPS THERE

02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:40.016
ARE WAYS TO COME UP WITH

02:42:40.083 --> 02:42:40.917
EXPEDITED APPROACHES AND THOSE

02:42:40.984 --> 02:42:42.953
KINDS OF SITUATIONS, SO THAT

02:42:43.019 --> 02:42:43.720
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE

02:42:43.787 --> 02:42:46.089
GOALS OF EPR CAN BE

02:42:46.156 --> 02:42:47.591
ACCOMPLISHED. AT THE SAME TIME,

02:42:47.657 --> 02:42:49.192
YOU CAN HAVE A PRODUCT THAT'S

02:42:49.259 --> 02:42:56.566
SAFE FOR CONSUMERS. THANK YOU.

AROUND FOR OVER TEN YEARS NOW.

02:43:15.685 --> 02:43:17.787
WE CAME TOGETHER AS A COALITION,

02:43:17.854 --> 02:43:21.291
PRIMARILY BECAUSE MANY OF THE

02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:24.261
ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED HAVE HAD

02:43:24.327 --> 02:43:26.730

02:43:48.785 --> 02:43:50.253
PERMITTING PROCESSES WHERE

02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:51.588
FOLKS WERE THROWN OUT OF

02:43:51.655 --> 02:43:52.889
HEARINGS BECAUSE OF SPEAKING

02:43:52.956 --> 02:43:55.926
SPANISH, FAKED SOIL SAMPLES,

02:43:55.992 --> 02:43:57.727

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS POLICIES,

02:44:02.432 --> 02:44:03.867

SOURCE REDUCTION AND

02:44:05.569 --> 02:44:06.770
REMEDIATION STRATEGIES. AND

02:44:06.836 --> 02:44:09.339
INSTEAD WE HAVE SEEN

CAPITULATION TO INDUSTRY AND

02:44:11.741 --> 02:44:13.610
CONTINUED ATTEMPTS TO DUMP ON

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:44:14.644 --> 02:44:16.913
ORGANIZATIONS. WE ARE GLAD THAT

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:18.782
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REFORMS.

02:44:18.848 --> 02:44:22.519
WE'VE MET WITH THE BEIS, WHO

02:44:22.586 --> 02:44:23.987
HAS LISTENED TO CERTAIN

02:44:24.054 --> 02:44:25.422
