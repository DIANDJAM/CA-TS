00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.018
ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS HAVE

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:40.219
APPROVED AND CONDUCTED A SERIES

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.754
OF AUDITS AND HEARINGS ON THIS.

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.923
AND I WANT TO THANK FORMER CHAIR

OF JLAC, SENATE MEMBER HART FOR

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.928
CONDUCTING HEARINGS ON THIS LAST

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.363
YEAR. THIS HAS BEEN A TEAM

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.164
EFFORT. WHAT I GATHER FROM THE

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.266
MOST RECENT STATE AUDITOR'S

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.834
REPORT, AND I WANT TO THANK

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:56.102
STATE AUDITOR PARK PARKS FOR

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:59.805
BEING HERE, IS THAT WE NEED

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:01.240
PROGRESS AND WE NEED IT MUCH,

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:02.508
MUCH FASTER. AND I THINK THAT

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.844
THERE'S NO MINCING WORDS ABOUT

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:06.279
THAT. WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:08.381
IT'S BEEN NEARLY 35 YEARS SINCE

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:09.749
NAGPRA, THE NATIVE AMERICAN

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.217
GRAVES PROTECTION AND

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.052
REPATRIATION ACT, WAS ENACTED,

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.887
AND THE UC SYSTEM STILL HAS NOT

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:15.655
EVEN DETERMINED HOW MANY REMAINS

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.724
IT NEEDS TO REPATRIATE. THAT'S

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.559
UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:21.727
UNACCEPTABLE. AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.162
HEAR FROM THE LEADERS HERE

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.497
TODAY. APPRECIATE YOU COMING.

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:28.868
BUT AS EDUCATORS, AS FOLKS WHO

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:32.004
OFTENTIMES GRADE PROGRESS OF

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.074
STUDENTS, WE CAN SAY THAT WE

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.475
DON'T HAVE A PASSING GRADE. WE

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:37.643
ARE STILL FAILING. AND I THINK

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.414
WE NEED TO VERY SERIOUSLY

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.383
CONSIDER HOW WE CAN ALL WORK

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.321
TOWARDS GETTING AN A+ ON THIS.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.388
AND RIGHT NOW, WE'RE NOT EVEN

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:51.891
CLOSE TO THAT. THE OFFICE OF THE

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.359
PRESIDENT NEEDS TO PROVIDE

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:53.926
LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT ON

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:55.928
THESE REPATRIATIONS. AND WHAT

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:58.798
DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS WE NEED

00:09:58.864 --> 00:09:59.532
FIRM TIMELINES AT BOTH THE

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:00.433
SYSTEM WIDE AND CAMPUS LEVEL,

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.768
AND WE NEED REAL, MEANINGFUL

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:05.604
PROGRESS WHEN THAT WILL BE MADE.

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.273
WE ALSO NEED THEM, THE UC

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.908
SYSTEM, TO WORK HAND IN HAND.

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:09.875
AND WE'VE SAID THIS BEFORE WITH

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.278
THE TRIBES TO REPATRIATE THEIR

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.012
ANCESTORS RETURNS. THIS

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.613
SHOULDN'T BE A PROCESS THAT'S

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.149
DONE AROUND THE TRIBES SHOULD BE

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.551
DONE HAND IN HAND WITH THE

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:19.852
TRIBES IN CONSULTATION WITH

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:21.887
TRIBAL LEADERS. AND WE WILL HEAR

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.256
FROM THOSE TRIBAL LEADERS TODAY.

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:25.658
JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING,

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.159
CHAIRMAN RAMOS, THANK YOU AGAIN

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:28.828

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.763
MAKING THIS A PRIORITY, NOT FOR

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.666
NOT ONLY FOR FIRST NATIONS

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:36.569
NATIVE CALIFORNIANS, BUT EVERY

00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:38.037
CALIFORNIAN, BECAUSE I THINK THE

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.972
EXPOSURE THAT MANY OF US,

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.541
BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK, HAVE HAD

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:45.611
TO THIS ISSUE, HAVE HAVE BEEN

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.380
SHOCKED, FRANKLY. AND I THINK

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:49.982
THAT WE ARE NOW AT A POINT WHERE

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:51.717
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO COME

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:53.753
BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR AND CONDUCT

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:57.423
HEARINGS AND HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.891
OFTENTIMES SAY THE SAME THING

00:10:58.958 --> 00:10:59.959
OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHAT WE

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:01.093
WANT IS ACTION. WE WANT

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.795
PROGRESS. SO THANK YOU FOR ALL

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:04.663
THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE. AND

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.866
IT'S REALLY AN HONOR AND A

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:07.633
PRIVILEGE FOR JACK TO HOLD THIS

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.905
REMAINS AND CULTURAL ITEMS IN

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:42.408
THEIR POSSESSION. MORE THAN 30

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:44.743
YEARS AFTER NAGPRA, THE UC

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.545
SYSTEM CONTINUES TO HOLD

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.180
THOUSANDS OF NATIVE AMERICAN

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.782
REMAINS AND HUNDREDS OF

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.850
THOUSANDS OF CULTURAL ITEMS THAT

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:55.020
MAY BE SUBJECT TO NAGPRA. UC

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:56.889
CAMPUSES CONTINUE TO FIND

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:58.724
PREVIOUSLY UNDOCUMENTED

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.226
COLLECTIONS SINCE OUR AUDIT IN

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:02.061
2022, FOR EXAMPLE, THREE

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.295
CAMPUSES REPORTED NEW

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.597
DISCOVERIES AT RIVERSIDE, SAN

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:08.400
DIEGO AND SANTA BARBARA. DURING

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.836
OUR 2025 AUDIT, WE DISCOVERED

00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:13.272
THAT SANTA BARBARA HAD FAILED TO

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:14.673
DISCLOSE AT LEAST FIVE

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.941
COLLECTIONS TO NIH AND THE

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:18.510
NATIONAL NAGPRA PROGRAM THAT THE

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.946
CAMPUS'S OWN DATA HAD ALREADY

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:23.482
IDENTIFIED AS NAGPRA RELATED.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.818
THE UC SYSTEM LACKS CLEAR GOALS

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:27.686
AND PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:29.421
WOULD ALLOW UCOP AND THE PUBLIC

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.190
TO HOLD CAMPUSES ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:32.891
THE SLOW PACE OF THEIR

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.061
REPATRIATION EFFORTS. AT THE

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:37.730
FOUR CAMPUSES WE VISITED, WE

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:39.498
MEASURED THE PACE OF THEIR

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:40.899
REPATRIATION ACTIVITIES OVER A

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:43.001
TWO YEAR PERIOD, PROJECTING THAT

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:44.803
AT THAT PACE, IT MAY TAKE

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.605
DECADES TO FULLY RETURN THE

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.674
COLLECTIONS IN THEIR POSSESSION.

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:50.309
FOR EXAMPLE, SAN DIEGO MAY NEED,

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:54.146
UNTIL THE YEAR 2037, RIVERSIDE

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:56.081
2041. SANTA BARBARA MAY NEED

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:59.218
UNTIL 2053, AND GIVEN THE LARGE

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:01.053
AMOUNT OF COLLECTIONS AT UC

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.955
BERKELEY, WE CALCULATED WOULD

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.757
NEED TO WORK FIVE TIMES FASTER

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:08.494
JUST TO RETURN 75% OF WHAT IT

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.763
HAS BY THE YEAR 2089. THE UK'S

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.898
LACK OF REPATRIATION GOALS AND

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:14.800
TARGETED TIMELINES, ALONG WITH

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.468
LIMITED CAMPUS SPENDING,

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.604
REFLECTS HOW NAGPRA IS BEING

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.572
PRIORITIZED. UC BERKELEY, WHICH

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.541
HAS THE LARGEST COLLECTION AND

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:24.443
THOUSANDS OF HUMAN REMAINS,

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.578
BUDGETED JUST 1.6 MILLION FOR

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:29.081
PERSONNEL COSTS IN 2324, BUT

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.950
SPENT HALF OF THAT AMOUNT,

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:33.419
$880,000, AND THE CAMPUS HAS

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.220
CONTINUED TO CARRY FORWARD

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:36.388
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:38.424
PREVIOUSLY BUDGETED BUT UNSPENT

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.659
FUNDS AT UC BERKELEY. AT UC

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.195
SANTA BARBARA THAT HAS OVER

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:45.030
200,000 POTENTIAL CULTURAL ITEMS

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:47.065
THAT STILL NEED TO BE EVALUATED.

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:49.301
THE CAMPUS DIDN'T REALIZE THAT

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:51.470
IT FAILED TO FULLY ALLOCATE

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:54.740
NAGPRA FUNDS TO NAGPRA TEAM, AND

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:56.608
THEY WEREN'T AWARE OF THIS UNTIL

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:57.843
WE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.778
BUDGETING PRACTICES IN FISCAL

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:02.614
YEAR 2425. SANTA BARBARA

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:05.417
ORIGINALLY ALLOCATED JUST

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.052
$212,000 FOR NAGPRA ACTIVITIES,

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:09.254
AND AFTER OUR QUESTIONING, THE

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:10.556
CAMPUS REALIZED IT NEEDED TO. IT

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:13.025
NEEDED TO TRANSFER ANOTHER

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:14.893
$900,000 TO MAKE UP FOR

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.261
ALLOCATING LESS THAN WHAT HAD

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:17.763
BEEN BUDGETED IN PRIOR YEARS.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.264
AND FURTHER, EACH OF THE FOUR

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.999
CAMPUSES THAT WE VISITED DURING

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:21.967
THE AUDIT SPENT LESS THAN HALF

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.802
OF THE FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.571
TRIBAL ASSISTANCE. WHERE THESE

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:26.905
FUNDS ARE USED TO HELP TRIBES

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:28.640
DEFRAY THE COSTS OF TRAVEL AND

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:30.576
OTHER EXPENSES INCURRED WHEN

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:32.911
CONSULTING WITH THE UC. AND

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:34.546
ALTHOUGH UCOP HAS FULLY

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:35.781
IMPLEMENTED MANY OF THE

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:37.049
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR PRIOR

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.618
AUDIT, UCOP IS PRIMARILY DONE SO

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.119
THROUGH ISSUING VARIOUS POLICIES

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:43.722
AND GUIDANCE TO THE UC CAMPUSES.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.924
HOWEVER, UCOP GENERALLY LEAVES

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:48.093
IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES TO

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.495
IMPLEMENT THESE POLICIES WITH

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:51.964
LITTLE OVERSIGHT OR CONSEQUENCE

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.165
FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. AS WE NOTED

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.934
IN OUR 2022 AUDIT REPORT, UCOP

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.070
HAS HISTORICALLY VIEWED EACH

00:18:58.136 --> 00:18:59.771
CAMPUS AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:02.241
NAGPRA COMPLIANCE AND THE RETURN

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.108
OF ITS COLLECTIONS. INSTEAD OF

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:05.477
VIEWING THIS AS A UNIVERSITY

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.279
WIDE RESPONSIBILITY, THERE IS A

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:09.147
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:19:09.214 --> 00:19:10.916
REPATRIATION PLANNING AND

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.151
EXECUTION WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:15.687
AND ITS POLICY. THE SYSTEM WIDE

00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:17.356
NAGPRA COMMITTEE IS CHARGED WITH

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:19.157
PROVIDING COMPLIANCE, OVERSIGHT,

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:21.026
AND ADVISING THE UC PRESIDENT ON

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:22.828
THE UNIVERSITY'S IMPLEMENTATION

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:26.098
OF NAGPRA AND CAL NAGPRA. IN OUR

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:28.367
FIRST AUDIT FROM 2020, WE NOTED

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:29.801
THAT UC CAMPUSES AT THAT TIME

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.570
WERE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT THE

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:33.338
STATUS OF ITS REPATRIATION

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:35.040
ACTIVITIES TO THE COMMITTEE, AND

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.842
UCOP SUBSEQUENTLY AGREED TO

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.911
REQUIRE BIANNUAL REPORTING IN

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:41.880
OUR SECOND AUDIT IN 2022, UCOP

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:43.248
REQUIRED CAMPUSES TO DEVELOP

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.450
THEIR OWN REPATRIATION TIMELINE,

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:46.985
SPECIFYING WHEN REMAINS WOULD BE

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:49.154
RETURNED. HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE,

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:51.123
UCOP DID NOT SET A DEADLINE FOR

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.091
COMPLETING THESE PLANS, AND OUR

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:54.927
2022 AUDIT NOTED THAT NONE OF

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:57.062
THE CAMPUSES HAD DONE SO. IN OUR

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:59.965
THIRD AUDIT, WE FOUND THAT

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.067
CAMPUSES COMPLETED PLANS, BUT

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:03.535
THREE OF THE FOUR LACKED

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:06.772
TIMELINES FOR FULL REPATRIATION.

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.173
RIVERSIDE AND BERKELEY'S PLANS,

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.575
FOR EXAMPLE, DID NOT INCLUDE A

00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:11.176
TIMELINE, INSTEAD FOCUSING ONLY

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:12.878
ON SELECT PORTIONS OF THEIR

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:15.047
COLLECTIONS. AND WE NOTED THAT

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:16.148
ONE COMMITTEE MEMBER AT THE

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.816
NAGPRA SYSTEMWIDE COMMITTEE

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.685
NOTED THAT BERKELEY'S PLANS WERE

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:20.852
CONFUSING AND DIDN'T PROVIDE A

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.588
REAL SENSE OF WHERE THE CAMPUS

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:24.456
WAS GOING AND ITS REPATRIATION

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:26.291
EFFORTS. SANTA BARBARA'S PLAN

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:27.960
REMOVED SPECIFIC GOALS THAT IT

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.561
HAD PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED IN

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:32.030
ITS TIMELINE, AND THREE OF THE

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:34.099
FOUR PLANS WE REVIEWED WERE

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.968
GENERALLY OUTDATED, HAVING BEEN

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:38.437
CREATED IN 2023 SEVERAL YEARS

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:39.671
LATER, MAKING THEM LESS

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:41.106
MEANINGFUL FOR THE SYSTEM WIDE

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:44.109
NAGPRA COMMITTEE AND FURTHER

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:45.944
UCP'S REVIEW OF CAMPUS NAGPRA

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:47.946
BUDGETS WERE UNDOCUMENTED, AND

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.681
WHEN COMPARED AGAINST

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:50.515
REPATRIATION PLANS THAT LACK

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:53.151
CLEAR TIMELINES AND GOALS, IT'S

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:55.053
UNCLEAR HOW UCOP WOULD BE ABLE

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.521
TO EVALUATE WHETHER EACH

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:58.223
CAMPUS'S BUDGET IS APPROPRIATE

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.759
TO ACHIEVE TIMELY REPATRIATION.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:03.261
SO, IN CONCLUSION, OVERALL, THE

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.731
UK'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE TIMELY

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:06.732
REPATRIATION DEPENDS ON THE

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:08.567
SCOPE, SCHEDULE AND RESOURCES IT

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:10.936
COMMITS TO THIS EFFORT. HOWEVER,

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.638
THE UC HAS YET TO DETERMINE THE

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:14.306
FULL SCOPE OF ITS COLLECTIONS,

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:16.141
WITH CAMPUSES CONTINUING TO MAKE

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.976
NEW DISCOVERIES AND UCOP NOT

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:20.245
ENSURING CAMPUSES PROACTIVELY

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:21.780
SEARCH FOR UNDISCOVERED REMAINS

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:24.816
AND CULTURAL ITEMS, UC HAS YET

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:26.184
TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR SCHEDULE,

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:28.487
WITH CAMPUS REPATRIATION PLANS

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:30.122
LACKING CLEAR TIMELINES AND

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:32.357
PERFORMANCE METRICS TO ENSURE

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:33.492
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND TO ALLOW THE

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:34.926
LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC TO

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:37.696
MONITOR PROGRESS. AND UC HAS YET

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.464
TO ADEQUATELY FUND NAGPRA

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:41.366
BECAUSE UC CAN'T EXPLAIN WHAT

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:43.135
PACE OF REPATRIATION IT'S

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:44.970
CURRENTLY FUNDING. WHILE THE

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:46.538
CAMPUSES THEMSELVES UNDERSPEND,

00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:48.573
THE AMOUNTS BUDGETED FOR THESE

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.742
EFFORTS. IN OUR AUDIT REPORT, WE

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:52.577
MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.379
UCOP AIMED AT ESTABLISHING

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.848
PERFORMANCE METRICS, REQUIRING

00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:58.684
TIMELINES, AND ENSURING CAMPUSES

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.352
CONDUCT PROACTIVE SEARCHES,

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.220
AMONG OTHER THINGS. BUT ONE

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:03.989
THING I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.424
THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.925
LEGISLATURE TO PLAY TOWARDS

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.260
ENSURING THE UC COMMITS THE

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:10.462
FUNDING NECESSARY FOR NAGPRA AND

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:13.865
CAL NAGPRA, WE SUGGEST THAT THE

00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:15.667
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER DEFINING

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:17.969
HOW MUCH STATE FUNDING THE UC

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:19.604
COMMITS TO NAGPRA ACTIVITIES

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.373
THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.075
PROCESS, EITHER BY APPROPRIATING

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.310
NEW SPENDING AUTHORITY OR

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:27.179
EARMARKING A PORTION OF THE UK'S

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:28.880
CURRENT APPROPRIATION FOR ITS

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:31.416
NAGPRA WORK, AND FURTHER

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.151
SPECIFYING HOW THAT NAGPRA

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:34.786
APPROPRIATION WOULD BE USED. FOR

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:37.456
EXAMPLE, IN TERMS OF MORE FULL

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:39.324
REPORTING OF PROGRESS

00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:40.692
PERFORMANCE GOALS. SO BOTH THE

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:42.194
PUBLIC AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.396
MORE CLOSELY MONITOR THE UK'S

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:46.565
PROGRESS. WITH ME TODAY IS

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:48.033
GRAYSEN HUFF, WHO WAS THE TEAM

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.234
LEADER ON THE AUDIT ASSIGNMENT,

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:50.869
AND WE'D BOTH BE HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:53.105
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:55.941
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. IS

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:59.211
THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:05.150
DAIS FROM MEMBERS? THANK YOU.

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:07.686
AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE,

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:13.859
EVEN IN YOUR. DISCUSSION

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:14.960
PRESENTATION, YOU MENTIONED THAT

00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:17.162
EVEN IF THE UCS PUT MONEY INTO A

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:18.497
CERTAIN AREA, THAT MONEY WASN'T

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:21.032
BEING USED ENTIRELY FOR, FOR THE

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:25.303
PURPOSE. IS THAT WHAT? YES, THAT

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.205
THAT'S CORRECT. AND THIS IS THE

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:28.640
THIRD AUDIT. I JUST WANT TO

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:29.908
REITERATE THAT THIS IS THE THIRD

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:32.177
AUDIT ON THIS TOPIC. RIGHT?

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.645
CORRECT. AND FROM THE FIRST

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:35.680
AUDIT TO THE THIRD AUDIT, HAVE

00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:39.785
WE SEEN ANY COMPLIANCE? WE

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.653
CONTINUE TO SEE PROBLEMS WITH

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.055
THE UC DEMONSTRATING TIMELY

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.390
REPATRIATION OF THE ITEMS IN ITS

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:49.628
CONTROL. THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:52.097
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE'LL

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:52.864
WE'LL ASK AGAIN WHEN THE UCS

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:57.769
COME UP FOR. THEIR DISCUSSION.

00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:00.138
WE DO HAVE A QUESTION FROM

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:00.639
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHARON

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:04.709
QUIRK-SILVA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:07.212
PRESENTATION. AND I, IN FACT,

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:09.214
HAVE SAT ON SOME OF THESE

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:11.216
PRESENTATIONS BEFORE. SO IT IS A

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.652
LITTLE BIT SHOCKING THAT THIS IS

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:16.087
NOW THE THIRD AUDIT AND SOME OF

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:18.623
THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE HEARD

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.759
GOOD AMOUNT OF YEARS AGO ARE

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:23.295
STILL LINGERING. AND SO MY

00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:24.930
QUESTION IS BECAUSE I KNOW ONCE

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:26.965
YOU LEAVE THEN WE'LL HAVE THE

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:27.732
OTHER. BUT WHAT ARE YOUR

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:30.869
THOUGHTS ON WHY? IN FACT, THIS

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:34.906
IS NOT BEEN MADE A PRIORITY. I

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.975
KNOW THAT FUNDING. I KNOW THAT

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:39.077
WITH UNIVERSITIES THERE'S MANY,

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:41.613
MANY ISSUES THAT RANK AT THE TOP

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.149
OF THEIR LIST. AND THIS COULD

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:46.551
DEFINITELY BE PUSHED EITHER

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:47.752
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OR EVEN THE

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.988
BOTTOM AS IT APPEARS. BUT WHAT

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:52.657
IS YOUR THOUGHTS NOW THAT YOU

00:24:52.724 --> 00:24:54.092
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE THIRD

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:56.428
AUDIT OF WHY THE PROGRESS IS NOT

00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:58.997
BEING MADE? WE'VE CONTINUED TO

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:00.999
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO UCOP

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:03.335
THROUGH OUR VARIOUS AUDITS.

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:04.302
HISTORICALLY, IT'S BEEN THE

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:05.270
CAMPUSES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.639
THE LEADING ROLE IN ENSURING

00:25:07.706 --> 00:25:09.074
COMPLIANCE WITH NAGPRA. BUT

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.909
AUDIT AFTER AUDIT, WE CONTINUE

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:12.277
TO BELIEVE THAT UCOP NEEDS TO

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.279
TAKE A MUCH STRONGER LEADERSHIP

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:15.881
POSITION. THEY ARE UNIQUELY

00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:17.716
PLACED TO MAKE SURE CAMPUSES ARE

00:25:17.782 --> 00:25:19.384
FOLLOWING THE POLICIES THAT UCOP

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:21.620
HAS PUT OUT THERE. I THINK THE

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:23.054
PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING AT

00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:24.456
THIS POINT IS UCOP NOT DOING

00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:26.057
ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:27.392
POLICIES THAT THEY ISSUE ARE

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.493
ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED ON

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.995
THE GROUND BY THE CAMPUSES. AND

00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:31.930
SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE MORE EFFORT

00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:36.034
IN THAT AREA. SO I WOULD JUST

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:39.271
ADD, AS A FORMER CLASSROOM

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:41.840
TEACHER, YOU KNOW, THE STRUCTURE

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:44.376
OF HOW INFORMATION IS PRESENTED

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:46.878
TO A CAMPUS USUALLY COMES FROM A

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:48.280
SUPERINTENDENT TO A PRINCIPAL

00:25:48.346 --> 00:25:51.516
AND THEN TO THE TEACHERS, AND

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:55.120
THE IMPLEMENTATION, SOMETIMES

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:58.023
WITH MANY THINGS ON A LIST, CAN

00:25:58.089 --> 00:26:00.125
BE DISREGARDED OR EVEN AS WE

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:02.227
SEE, NOT IMPLEMENTED. SO I WOULD

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:04.429
DEFINITELY SAY THIS HAS TO BE

00:26:04.496 --> 00:26:09.534
MADE A PRIORITY, AS HAS BEEN

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:12.337
SUGGESTED IN ACTUALLY DIRECTED.

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:14.806
BUT IF THAT IS NOT COMING, IF WE

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:18.209
WANT TO SAY FROM THE TOP IN IN A

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:20.779
WAY THAT IS MADE CLEAR, THEN WE

00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:23.615
WILL HAVE A FOURTH AUDIT IN

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:26.484
PROGRESS, WILL STILL NOT BE

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:29.020
MADE. YOU CAN'T HAVE 30

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:31.122
PRIORITIES AT A UNIVERSITY

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:33.124
CAMPUS, BUT YOU CERTAINLY NEED

00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:35.026
TO COMPLY. AND I KNOW AS A

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:37.495
TEACHER, THERE WERE MANY TIMES I

00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:38.997
DIDN'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH WHAT

00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:42.300
WAS BEING ADDED TO OUR PLATE, OR

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:44.769
AND MANY TIMES NOT TAKEN OFF OUR

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:47.005
PLATE, BUT YOU HAVE TO DO THE

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:51.977
JOB THAT IS TOLD OR EXPLAINED,

00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:54.212
AND IF THIS IS NOT MADE A

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:56.348
PRIORITY AT UCOP, THEN THIS IS

00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:58.350
AT LEAST WHAT I CAN SEE WHERE

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:00.785
SOME OF THIS PROBLEM LIES. THANK

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:03.655
YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH, CHAIR.

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:05.223
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU,

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.058
AUDITOR PARKS FOR THE

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:08.626
PRESENTATION FOR ALL THE WORK

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:09.828
AND MR. HUFF FOR ALL YOUR WORK

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:12.063
ON THE AUDIT. AND I THINK THAT

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.932
THE ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:15.133
THINGS FROM THE AUDIT AS YOU

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.801
PRESENTED WERE THESE TIMELINES

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:20.105
OF HOW LONG WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:24.009
JUST TO COMPLY WITH STATE, STATE

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:28.346
AND FEDERAL LAW 2089 FOR THE

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:30.115
CAMPUS OF BERKELEY. AND

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:32.017
OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT IS NOT

00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:34.586
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL ALLOW TO

00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:38.023
HAPPEN. WE WANT TO SEE TIMELY

00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:41.459
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. SO AND

00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:42.761
BUILDING OFF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBERS

00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:44.529
QUIRK-SILVA QUESTIONS, WHAT DO

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:46.598
WE NEED TO DO, IN YOUR OPINION,

00:27:46.664 --> 00:27:48.533
TO SPEED UP THESE TIMELINES AND

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.137
TO ENSURE THAT THE UC SYSTEM IN

00:27:52.203 --> 00:27:55.373
THIS CASE HAS AND HAVE THE

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.343
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.445
IMPLEMENT THE REPATRIATION IN A

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:02.247
TIMELY FASHION, IN A LEGAL

00:28:02.313 --> 00:28:04.015
FASHION. WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:06.551
ARE THE TOP 2 TO 3 THINGS THAT

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:07.786
WE NEED TO DO? AND YOU DID SAY

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:09.754
IN YOUR PRESENTATION FUNDING.

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:11.222
SURE. WE YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:13.091
ALWAYS A THAT SEEMS TO ALWAYS BE

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:16.261
THE ISSUE WITH ANY AUDIT OR

00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:17.729
OVERSIGHT HEARING THAT WE HAVE

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.030
AS TO WHY SOMETHING DOESN'T GET

00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:20.532
DONE, THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH

00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:22.200
MONEY. I MEAN, WE HEAR THAT FROM

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:23.735
EVERY DEPARTMENT, FROM EVERY

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:25.904
NOOK AND CRANNY OF THE STATE AS

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.739
TO WHY PROBLEMS EXIST BEYOND

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:29.841
FUNDING. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:32.277
AS A LEGISLATURE TO ACTUALLY

00:28:32.343 --> 00:28:33.778
ENABLE THEM TO COMPLY WITH THE

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:36.481
LAW? I THINK IT GOES ALONG WITH

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:38.183
FUNDING, BUT A PART OF THE

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:40.351
FUNDING DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE A

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:41.886
CONVERSATION THAT TAKES PLACE

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:43.621
BETWEEN THE UC SYSTEM AND THE

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:45.390
LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT IS THE

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.592
GOAL, WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION IN

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:50.295
TERMS OF TIMELY REPATRIATION? WE

00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:51.496
HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:52.831
CULTURAL ITEMS, THOUSANDS OF

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:55.934
HUMAN REMAINS. A DISCUSSION

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.369
ABOUT HOW MUCH FUNDING RESULTS

00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:00.205
IN HOW MUCH PROGRESS AND SPEED

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:02.373
OF REPATRIATION, WHERE THAT

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.175
EXPECTATION IS CLEAR FOR THE

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:06.578
LEGISLATURE, FOR THE UC AND FOR

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:08.546
THE PUBLIC. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:11.683
THE UC SYSTEM BUDGETING FUNDS

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:13.551
FOR NAGPRA. WITHOUT A CLEAR

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:15.587
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT GOAL

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:17.322
WE'RE TARGETING. AND SO DURING

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:19.290
THE AUDIT, AS YOU NOTED, WE

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:20.792
LOOKED AT, WELL, GIVEN THE PACE

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.360
OF PROGRESS OVER TWO YEARS,

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:23.761
WHERE DOES THAT LEAD US TO? AND

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:26.164
IT LEADS US TO THAT VERY, YOU

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.165
KNOW, FAR OUT YEAR THAT YOU

00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:29.334
MENTIONED EARLIER. I THINK IF

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.603
THE LEGISLATURE SAT DOWN WITH

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:33.972
THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND SAID,

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:35.940
HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:38.076
GET THIS DONE IN TEN YEARS, 15

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:39.077
YEARS, FIVE YEARS? WHAT'S THE

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.678
NUMBER? HOW MUCH IS èC GOING TO

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:43.448
PAY OUT OF ITS OWN POCKET? HOW

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:44.516
MUCH ADDITIONAL MONEY DOES THE

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:45.416
LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONTRIBUTE

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:46.718
TO THE PROBLEM? BUT IT'S ALMOST

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:48.753
LIKE A PERFORMANCE BASED

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.289
BUDGETING EXERCISE ABOUT FUNDING

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:53.424
AND RESULTS, AND YOU HAVE TO TIE

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:55.126
RESULTS TO THE EFFORT THAT'S

00:29:55.193 --> 00:29:56.661
GOING TO BE EMPLOYED HERE IN

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:59.464
GRAYSON. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:00.331
OTHER COMMENTS ON

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:00.899
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE TOP

00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:01.833
PRIORITIES. I THINK THAT COVERS

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.535
IT. YEAH. APPRECIATE IT. THANK

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:05.470
YOU, MR. CHAIR. VERY HELPFUL.

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:07.372
THANK YOU SO MUCH. ASSEMBLY

00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:08.439
MEMBER CHADWICK, THANK YOU FOR

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:11.176
YOUR PRESENTATION. I'M ALONG

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:12.877
WITH MY COLLEAGUES, QUITE

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:14.245
APPALLED AT THOSE TIMELINES. I

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:16.481
WAS NINE YEARS OLD WHEN THIS

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:18.016
WENT INTO EFFECT, AND I DON'T

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:19.717
THINK THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.052
SITTING IN THOSE IN OUR SEATS

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.687
BACK THEN THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:24.055
THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:25.156
STILL HAVING, AND IT'S

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.124
UNACCEPTABLE. I MEAN, JUST

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:28.459
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. I'M

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:30.228
EAGER TO SEE I'M NOT SURE HOW

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:33.731
YOU HAVE A REBUTTAL FOR THOSE

00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:35.567
TIMELINES AND THE FACTS THAT YOU

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:36.935
GUYS JUST GAVE US. SO I'M EAGER

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.736
TO HEAR WHAT THEY SAY AND THE

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:43.174
NEXT GROUP. BUT I DON'T. THIS IS

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:46.311
IT'S RIDICULOUS. HONESTLY, I AM

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:47.879
SHOCKED THAT THIS IS THE THIRD

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:48.746
AUDIT AND WE'RE STILL HAVING

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:50.381
THESE CONVERSATIONS. OR I

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.816
SHOULDN'T SAY SHOCKED. I'M NOT

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:54.352
SHOCKED, JUST EMBARRASSED THAT

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:57.088
THIS IS OUR PROGRESS. I THINK

00:30:57.155 --> 00:31:00.725
THAT THIS SHOULD NOT TAKE THE

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:02.961
TIMELINESS NEEDS TO BE FASTER.

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:05.496
AND I THINK YOUR BUDGET AND YOUR

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:07.699
WHATEVER SECTOR YOU'RE IN SHOWS

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:09.667
YOUR PRIORITIES. AND IF THE UC

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:12.470
SYSTEM ISN'T BUDGETING THIS AS A

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.505
PRIORITY, THEN WE NEED TO CHANGE

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:16.708
THAT. AND I THINK THAT IT ALSO

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:18.109
COMES FROM LEADERSHIP, LIKE MY

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:19.811
COLLEAGUE WAS TALKING ABOUT. SO

00:31:19.877 --> 00:31:21.579
I THINK YOU MAKE TIME FOR THE

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:22.814
THINGS THAT YOU SEE AS A

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.882
PRIORITY. AND WE HAVE TO WE HAVE

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:26.818
TO CHANGE THAT FOCUS. I ALSO

00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:28.419
THINK THAT IF THE TRIBES HAD

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:29.754
SOMETHING THAT THE UC SYSTEM

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.589
HAD, THIS WOULD BE A DIFFERENT

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:32.390
CONVERSATION. AND THAT IS

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:34.626
COMPLETELY UNFAIR. SO I'M

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:36.227
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REST OF

00:31:36.294 --> 00:31:37.862
THE CONVERSATION AND HOPING THAT

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:39.564
THIS IS NOT THE CONVERSATION

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:40.832
WE'RE HAVING FOR THE FOURTH

00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:44.435
AUDIT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:45.670
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:50.875
THE DÍAS? I WANT TO THANK YOU,

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:53.778
MR. AUDITOR AND STAFF, FOR

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:56.648
CONTINUING TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:58.416
ON THESE AUDITS MOVING FORWARD.

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:02.420
YOU DID MAKE A MENTION AND

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.255
TALKING ABOUT LEGISLATIVE ROLE

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:06.958
AS CONSIDER STATE FUNDING ON

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:07.725
APPROPRIATIONS WITHIN THE

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:09.494
BUDGET. BUT IF I'M UNDERSTANDING

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.329
IT RIGHT, IT HAS TO COME WITH

00:32:11.396 --> 00:32:12.697
BENCHMARKS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.265
THAT MONEY THAT'S ALREADY GOING

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:16.968
TOWARDS THIS. THIS TOPIC HASN'T

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:19.270
BEEN FULLY USED BY THE UC

00:32:19.337 --> 00:32:21.205
SYSTEM. SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.674
CLARITY OF WHAT IT IS WE'RE

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.210
TRYING TO SEE WITH THE OUTCOME.

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:28.780
IF MONEY IS GOING TO BE PUT BACK

00:32:28.846 --> 00:32:30.081
INTO THE BUDGET FOR THAT. BUT

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:31.582
WE'RE HEARING AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:34.018
HEAR FROM THE UCS. IF THE

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:35.887
BUDGET'S THERE, MONEY IS THERE

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:37.622
AND IT'S NOT FULLY BEING USED.

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:40.158
IS THE SYSTEM WIDE POLICY AN

00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:41.359
AREA WHERE WE'RE AT AND WE'LL

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:43.361
GET AN UPDATE ON THAT MOVING

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:45.897
FORWARD. BUT I DO WANT TO THANK

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.131
YOU, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:32:47.198 --> 00:32:48.833
MEETING WITH YOUR OFFICE ON

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.036
DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:53.204
LEGISLATURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:55.239
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. AS

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:58.176
WE'LL MOVE NOW TO OUR NEXT

00:32:58.242 --> 00:33:00.378

HONORED TO SERVE AS THE PROVOST

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:58.936
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

SYSTEM. IN THIS CAPACITY, I'M

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:02.573
RESPONSIBLE FOR LEADING OUR

SYSTEM'S NAGPRA AND CAL NAGPRA

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:06.544
EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF OUR NEW

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:08.045
PRESIDENT, JAMES MILLICAN, AND

00:34:08.112 --> 00:34:09.714
IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR

BY REITERATING OUR APOLOGY AND

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.925
FOR MY PERSONAL REGRET OVER THE

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:22.059
UNIVERSITY'S ROLE IN THE

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:24.562
ORIGINAL ACQUISITION OF NATIVE

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:26.731
AMERICAN AND NATIVE HAWAIIAN

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.466
ANCESTORS AND THEIR BELONGINGS.

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:30.501
THEY WERE OBTAINED IN VIOLATION

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.804
OF INDIGENOUS SPIRITUAL AND

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.306
CULTURAL BELIEFS WITHOUT FREE,

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:37.141
PRIOR AND INFORMED CONSENT. AND

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.710
THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE. I'M HERE

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:41.879
TODAY TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT UC

00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:44.282
IS ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO FULLY

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:45.950
IMPLEMENTING THE SPIRIT, AS WELL

00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:48.286
AS THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:50.488
NAGPRA AND CAL NAGPRA.

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:52.323
ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPRESS OUR

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:53.691
APPRECIATION FOR THE CAREFUL

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:54.859
ATTENTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.994
THE STATE AUDITOR CONTAINED IN

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:59.897
THE APRIL 2025 AUDIT REPORT. WE

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:02.433
ARE IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THEM

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.335
EXPEDITIOUSLY, BUT I APPRECIATE

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:06.671
THIS INVITATION TO SHARE WITH

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:08.139
YOU THE UPDATE THE CHAIRMAN HAS

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:10.107
ASKED FOR ON OUR RECENT PROGRESS

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:13.244
AND OUR PLANS GOING FORWARD. IN

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:16.414
THE PAST YEAR, UC CAMPUSES

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:18.950
REPATRIATED MORE THAN 2800

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:21.085
ANCESTORS AND NEARLY 80,000 OF

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:23.554
THEIR FUNERARY BELONGINGS. AN

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:26.524
ADDITIONAL 17,000 BELONGINGS OF

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:27.925
CULTURAL IMPORTANCE WERE ALSO

00:35:27.992 --> 00:35:30.127
RETURNED THIS YEAR, AS YOU'LL

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:32.263
SEE IN THE CHARTS THAT YOU SEE

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.065
DISTRIBUTED PRIOR TO TODAY'S

00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:35.833
HEARING. SINCE OUR NEW NAGPRA

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.402
POLICY WAS PUT INTO PLACE IN

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.471
2022, THERE HAS BEEN ACTUALLY A

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:42.673
STEEP ACCELERATION OF

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.842
REPATRIATION ACTIVITY THAT WOULD

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:46.244
NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.778
THE SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT OF

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.914
THE TRIBAL NATIONS, WHO

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.282
COMMITTED MANY HOURS OF

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:52.817
CONSULTATION WITH OUR CAMPUSES

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.919
TO SEE THIS PROGRESS THROUGH

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:56.220
CONSULTATION THAT IS REQUIRED BY

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:59.991
LAW. IN TOTAL, UC HAS NOW

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:02.894
REPATRIATED 53% OF THE ANCESTORS

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.663
AND 54% OF THE FUNERARY

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.532
BELONGINGS IN ITS HOLDINGS.

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:10.134
ANOTHER 27% OF ANCESTORS HAVE

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:12.169
BEEN CULTURALLY AFFILIATED AND

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:14.739
ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:16.240
REPATRIATION. TOGETHER, AS

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:17.708
YOU'LL SEE IN THE CHARTS THAT I

00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:20.144
HOPE YOU HAVE, WE'VE DISTRIBUTED

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:23.314
THEM. THAT MEANS THAT 80.3% OF

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:25.516
ALL NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS HELD

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:27.618
BY THE UNIVERSITY HAVE EITHER

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:30.187
BEEN REPATRIATED OR HAVE BEEN

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:32.023
PUBLISHED IN A FEDERAL REGISTER

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:34.625
NOTICE, AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:35.960
REPATRIATION. AS THE LAW

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:38.162
REQUIRES. WHILE I APPRECIATE

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:40.698
VERY MUCH THE DEDICATION OUR

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:42.199
CAMPUS COLLEAGUES HAVE SHOWN TO

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.168
GET US TO THIS POINT, WE ARE

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:45.836
CONSCIOUS, AS ALL OF YOU ARE,

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:48.606
THAT SUBSTANTIAL WORK REMAINS

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:49.907
THOUSANDS OF ANCESTORS AND

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:51.475
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.910
CULTURAL ITEMS ARE STILL HELD ON

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:56.080
OUR CAMPUSES. AS A DEMONSTRATION

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.448
OF OUR STRONG COMMITMENT TO MEET

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:59.283
THESE OBLIGATIONS, WE ARE

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.886
IMPLEMENTING A NEW PLAN TO

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:03.654
ACCELERATE OUR REPATRIATION

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:06.157
EFFORTS WITH MUCH STRONGER

00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:07.658
OVERSIGHT. AS HAS BEEN REQUESTED

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.360
BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.162
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW EXACTLY

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:13.831
WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. FIRST, WE

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.566
WILL SPEED OUR EFFORTS TO

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:16.968
REPATRIATE THE REMAINING

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:18.502
ANCESTORS AND FUNERARY

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.204
BELONGINGS HELD UNDER UC

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:22.373
CONTROL. WE EXPECT TO MAKE

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.208
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE NEXT

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:26.444
THREE YEARS, WITH THE EXPLICIT

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.513
AND TIMELINE GOAL OF COMPLETING

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.116
THIS WORK BY THE END OF 2028. WE

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.285
WILL ACCELERATE THE PROCESS,

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:36.420
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL OF

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:38.656
RESEARCHING AND REVIEWING

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.391
COLLECTION RECORDS,

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.159
COMMUNICATING WITH OUR TRIBAL

00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:44.028
PARTNERS, AND INVITING THEM FOR

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.363
CONSULTATION TO FURTHER THIS

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:48.299
GOAL OF COMPLETING THIS WORK BY

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:50.901
2028, WE WILL COMPLETE A REVIEW

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:53.838
OF ALL HIGH RISK AREAS OF OUR

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:56.307
CAMPUSES FOR ANY UNDISCOVERED

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:58.009
ANCESTORS AND POTENTIAL CULTURAL

00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:01.379
ITEMS BY JUNE 30TH OF 2026, AND

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:03.414
YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE BANK.

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:06.684
WE WILL IDENTIFY AND RECALL ALL

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.486
LOANS OF NATIVE AMERICAN

00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:10.287
ANCESTORS AND POTENTIAL CULTURAL

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.556
ITEMS BY JANUARY OF 2026. THOSE

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.258
ARE THE TIMELINES YOU ASKED FOR.

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:15.993
THOSE ARE THE TIMELINES WE WILL

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.895
DELIVER. UNLESS OUR TRIBAL

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.296
PARTNERS OBJECT TO THEIR

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:21.132
RELOCATION FOR ANY REASON, AS IS

00:38:21.198 --> 00:38:23.668
THEIR RIGHT, WE WILL UPDATE ALL

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:26.170
OF OUR CAMPUS REPATRIATION

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:28.673
IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH NOW

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.775
REQUIRE ESTABLISHING CLEAR

00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.411
TIMELINES AND EXPECTATIONS FOR

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:34.512
REPATRIATION. BY DECEMBER OF

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:37.515
THIS YEAR, WE ARE REQUIRING, IN

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:40.518
MY OFFICE, DETAILED QUARTERLY

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:41.952
UPDATES, WHICH WE COMMENCED

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:45.656
ACTUALLY ON JULY 31ST, 2025 TO

00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:48.426
THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:49.960
TO DEMONSTRATE CONSISTENT

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:50.861
PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THOSE

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.697
GOALS. AND IF THEY FALL SHORT,

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:54.799
IT WILL BE ON MY PLATE TO MAKE

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.767
SURE WE CHECK OUT WHY. IN

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.436
ADDITION TO THESE PLANS, WE HAVE

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:00.971
COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.540
RESOURCES TO FACILITATE THE WORK

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.709
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON OUR

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:08.212
CAMPUSES. THIS INCLUDES OVER

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.081
$8.8 MILLION. IN ADDITION TO THE

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:11.916
FUNDING WE'VE ALREADY PROVIDED

00:39:11.982 --> 00:39:13.284
OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.852
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO USE THAT

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:17.655
MONEY FOR? FIRST, WE WILL BE

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.724
ENABLING THEM TO HIRE ADDITIONAL

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.026
STAFF ACROSS THE CAMPUSES TO

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:23.527
EXPAND THEIR CAPACITY TO MEET

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:24.462
THE GOALS. I'VE ALREADY

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:26.330
MENTIONED TO YOU AND TO ENGAGE

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:28.733
IN EXPEDIENT BUT RESPECTFUL

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:31.702
TRIBAL CONSULTATION. WE WILL USE

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.037
THOSE FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:34.905
TRIBAL PARTNERS BY CONTRIBUTING

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:37.174
MORE THAN WE ALREADY HAVE TO

00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:38.843
TRIBAL STAFF TIME TO

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:40.578
TRANSPORTATION COSTS TO LODGING,

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:42.113
MEALS, PARKING AND OTHER

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:43.748
CONSULTATION COSTS BECAUSE WE

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:45.583
HOPE THAT THAT WILL LIGHTEN THE

00:39:45.649 --> 00:39:47.218
BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:48.919
CONSULTATION PROCESS, WHICH ARE

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:51.088
SIGNIFICANT. WE ARE PARTICULARLY

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:52.890
MINDFUL OF THE RESPONSIBILITY WE

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.892
HAVE TO SUPPORT THE COSTS AND

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:57.294
THE LOGISTICS OF REBURIAL TO THE

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.797
EXTENT POSSIBLE. TOWARD THAT

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:01.132
END, AS I HAVE MENTIONED

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:03.134
PRIVATELY TO CHAIRMAN RAMOS, WE

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.736
HAVE IDENTIFIED 20 POTENTIAL

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:08.038
SITES ON UNIVERSITY LAND

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.006
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:11.242
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE CANDIDATES

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:13.043
FOR REBURIAL. IF OUR TRIBAL

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.845
PARTNERS WISH TO PURSUE THAT

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.147
OPTION, AND WE ARE BEGINNING

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:17.748
THAT CONSULTATION PROCESS RIGHT

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:19.984
NOW SO THAT THEY CAN CONSIDER

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.552
THOSE OPTIONS, THAT IS SOMETIMES

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.053
BEEN A BARRIER. HAVING

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.555
APPROPRIATE LAND HAS BEEN A

00:40:24.622 --> 00:40:26.357
BARRIER. WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:28.893
THAT BARRIER. IT'S OUR HOPE THAT

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:30.961
IN IDENTIFYING THESE POTENTIAL

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.163
CANDIDATE SITES, WE'LL HAVE AT

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:34.165
LEAST A HELPFUL STARTING POINT

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:35.800
FOR CONSULTATION. AND IT IS

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.902
ENCOURAGING TO ME THAT THERE ARE

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:39.637
ALREADY A NUMBER OF PRODUCTIVE

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:42.206
TRIBAL CONSULTATIONS IN PROCESS

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:43.741
ABOUT THE USE OF SOME OF THESE

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:46.844
POTENTIAL SITES IN THE FUTURE.

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:49.413
FINALLY, WE WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.848
TO CAMPUSES THAT NEED TO ENHANCE

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:53.484
THEIR COLLECTIONS MANAGEMENT

00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:54.885
DATABASES AND THAT WILL IMPROVE

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.921
THEIR ABILITY TO SHARE AND

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:59.423
CONSULT WITH THE TRIBES. WE HAVE

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.659
GIVEN CONSIDERABLE THOUGHT, AND

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:04.161
I HOPE THIS WILL BE AS EXCITING

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:06.263
TO YOU AS IT IS TO ME, TO THE

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.832
WAYS IN WHICH A UNIVERSITY LIKE

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.500
OURS CAN ACTUALLY GO BEYOND THE

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.769
LETTER OF THE LAW, TO ACT ON OUR

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.170
COMMITMENT TO THE UNDERLYING

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:15.105
PURPOSE OF REPATRIATION. WITH

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:17.041
OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS, WE ARE

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:19.276
HOPING TO EDUCATE A NEW

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:21.111
GENERATION OF REPATRIATION

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:22.880
EXPERTS FOR UNIVERSITIES AND

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.049
MUSEUMS ACROSS THE NATION,

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:26.884
BECAUSE WE'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.085
THAT THERE ARE TOO FEW PEOPLE

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:29.620
WITH THE NEEDED EXPERTISE, AND

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:31.322
THAT MAKES IT ALL THE MORE

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:33.290
DIFFICULT TO ATTEND TO THESE

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.458
RESPONSIBILITIES, BOTH FOR US

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.493
AND FOR MANY OTHER UNIVERSITIES,

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.329
MUSEUMS, TRANSIT SYSTEMS AND

00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:40.564
OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.299
OBLIGED TO RECTIFY THE WRONGS

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:45.236
THAT NAGPRA LIFTS UP. TO ADDRESS

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:47.671
THIS NEED, WE HAVE COMMITTED

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:49.039
$400,000 OVER THE NEXT THREE

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:51.308
YEARS TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT,

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.843
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TRIBES,

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.779
A NEW CERTIFICATE PROGRAM TO

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:57.882
TRAIN EXPERTS IN THIS AREA. AND

00:41:57.948 --> 00:42:00.451
WE EXPECT TO LAUNCH THAT IN

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:02.419
2026. WE ARE WORKING WITH CAMPUS

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:03.954
PARTNERS TO BRING THIS

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:05.356
CERTIFICATE PROGRAM INTO

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.891
EXISTENCE AND TO WELCOME

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:08.259
STUDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:10.027
MAY NOT HAVE YET OBTAINED A

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:11.762
COLLEGE DEGREE, SO THEY CAN

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:14.064
BECOME EXPERTS WITH THE NEEDED

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:15.799
EXPERIENCE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:17.968
REPATRIATION PROCESS NOW AND FOR

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:20.437
GENERATIONS TO COME. AT THE

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:22.273
REQUEST OF CHAIR RAMOS, WE WILL

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:24.341
ALSO EXPLORE WAYS IN WHICH OUR

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:26.911
èC FIELD COURSES AND PROGRAMS

00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:29.346
CAN COLLABORATE WITH AND SUPPORT

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:31.448
OUR REPATRIATION EFFORTS ACROSS

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.751
THE UC SYSTEM, HE ASKED. WE WILL

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:36.253
DELIVER AT THE CONCLUSION OF MY

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.122
REMARKS. YOU WILL HEAR FROM MY

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:38.722
COLLEAGUE, CHANCELLOR LYONS,

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:41.258
FROM UC BERKELEY AND OUR CAMPUS

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:42.760
REPATRIATION COORDINATORS AT UC

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:45.696
SAN DIEGO AND SANTA BARBARA, EVA

00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:47.932
TRUJILLO AND HUGH RADY. BEFORE

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.600
THEY BEGIN, THOUGH, I'D LIKE TO

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:52.136
JUST SHARE A FEW OTHER RECENT

00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:53.904
SUCCESSES IN REPATRIATION AT

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:55.739
THREE OTHER CAMPUSES BECAUSE YOU

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.942
WANTED A COMPLETE UPDATE. IN THE

00:42:58.008 --> 00:43:00.811
PAST YEAR, UC DAVIS HAS INVITED

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:03.314
176 TRIBES TO CONSULT ON CAMPUS

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.715
HOLDINGS AND HAS COMPLETED OVER

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:06.984
60 CONSULTATION MEETINGS WITH 28

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:10.087
DIFFERENT TRIBES. THIS IS OUR

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:12.556
DAVIS CAMPUS TO REPATRIATE 25

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:15.592
ANCESTORS AND OVER 8800 CULTURAL

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:18.395
ITEMS IN LAST YEAR ALONE, FIVE

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:20.564
TRIBAL PARTNERS HAVE ENTRUSTED

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.334
UC DAVIS TO RESPECTFULLY HOLD

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.802
ANCESTORS AND SENSITIVE ITEMS ON

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:27.204
THEIR BEHALF, WHILE REBURIAL

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:30.207
ARRANGEMENTS ARE UNDERWAY. UC

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.242
RIVERSIDE HAS REPATRIATED 62

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:34.645
ANCESTORS SINCE 2021. THE CAMPUS

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:37.381
HAS CONSULTED WITH TRIBES ON 80%

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.516
OF THE COLLECTIONS UNDER THEIR

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:41.685
CONTROL, WITH PLANS TO REACH

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:44.588
100% WITHIN TWO YEARS. AS SOME

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:47.458
OF YOU KNOW, UCLA, THEIR WORK

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:49.193
WITH TRIBAL PARTNERS OVER THE

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:51.128
LAST 30 YEARS HAS RESULTED IN

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:55.366
THE REPATRIATION OF 99.9% OF THE

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:56.767
KNOWN ANCESTORS THAT WERE

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:59.003
CONTROLLED BY THE CAMPUS IN THE

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:01.005
PAST YEAR. UCLA HAS FURTHERED

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:04.308
THIS PROGRESS BY ENGAGING IN 68

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.876
CONSULTATIONS WITH TRIBAL

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:07.578
PARTNERS TOWARD REPATRIATION OF

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:10.147
THE REMAINING ANCESTORS, SUMMARY

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:13.050
ITEMS, AND ON DUTY OF CARE.

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:15.019
NONETHELESS, I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:17.021
MUCH MORE WORK IS AHEAD, AND WE

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:19.156
NEED A STRONGER SENSE OF URGENCY

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:20.991
TO CONCEIVE TO ACHIEVE OUR

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:23.527
GOALS. OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.129
ON STRONG AND TRUSTWORTHY

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:26.997
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE TRIBES,

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:28.832
WHICH WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:31.769
NURTURING OVER THE LONG TERM. I

00:44:31.835 --> 00:44:32.836
HOPE THAT YOU WILL SEE THROUGH

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:35.239
OUR RECENT ACTIONS THAT WE ARE

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:36.774
TAKING A MORE AGGRESSIVE

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.775
APPROACH TO THIS CRITICALLY

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:40.044
IMPORTANT EFFORT, WITH MUCH

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.546
GREATER OVERSIGHT BY THE

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:43.981
UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.749
PRESIDENT TO ENSURE THAT WE MEET

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:47.618
THEM. PRESIDENT MILLIKEN AND I,

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:48.952
ALONG WITH OUR CAMPUS

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.387
CHANCELLORS, ARE WHOLEHEARTEDLY

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:52.289
COMMITTED TO FULFILLING THESE

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.824
GOALS, AS ARE ALL THE MEMBERS OF

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:55.926
OUR STAFF. AND, MR. CHAIRMAN, IF

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.661
I MAY BE PERMITTED A PERSONAL

00:44:57.728 --> 00:44:59.563
NOTE HERE, WE WOULD NOT HAVE

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.331
MADE THIS KIND OF PROGRESS

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:02.066
WITHOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY

00:45:02.132 --> 00:45:02.666
ASSISTANCE OF OUR COLLEAGUE,

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:04.768
JOSEPH CASTRO. I WISH HE COULD

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:06.670
HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY. HE'S VERY

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.872
ILL. HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO JOIN

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:11.008
US. BUT I WANTED TO DEDICATE MY

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:13.077
TESTIMONY TO HIM WITH MY THANKS

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:14.411
FOR EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE TO

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:16.013
GET US THERE. SO THANK YOU

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.115
AGAIN, CHAIR RAMOS, CHAIR AND

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:19.783
MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES FOR

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.518
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:23.220
TODAY. I'LL BE VERY PLEASED TO

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:25.089
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN. AND

00:45:25.155 --> 00:45:28.659
NOW I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.494
MY COLLEAGUE, CHANCELLOR LYONS.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.529
GOOD MORNING. ESTEEMED TRIBAL

00:45:32.596 --> 00:45:34.398
LEADERS, CHAIRS RAMOS,

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.766
HAIRABEDIAN AND LAIRD AND

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:37.434
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:39.536
YOU FOR INVITING ME TO

00:45:39.603 --> 00:45:41.305
PARTICIPATE IN THIS MORNING'S

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.307
HEARING. HEARING ON NAGPRA. I'M

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:44.575
PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:46.777
PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.078
REPATRIATION EFFORTS AT UC

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:50.514
BERKELEY, AND TO SHARE OUR

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.682
PROGRESS. SINCE I CAME BEFORE

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:54.585
YOU LAST YEAR, I AM HONORED BY

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:56.753
THE PRESENCE OF THE TRIBAL

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.455
LEADERS TODAY, AND LOOK FORWARD

00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:00.290
TO HEARING THEIR TESTIMONY ON

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:03.460
THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. FIRST, I

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:06.864
WANT TO AGAIN ACKNOWLEDGE AND

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.032
APOLOGIZE FOR THE DEEP PAIN THAT

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:11.068
THE UNIVERSITY HAS CAUSED NATIVE

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:12.836
PEOPLE. SINCE OUR FOUNDING,

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:14.037
UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATIVES AND

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:16.006
OTHERS TOOK ANCESTORS AND SACRED

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:18.275
BELONGINGS WITHOUT TRIBAL

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:19.443
PERMISSION, AND HELD THOSE

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.512
ANCESTRAL REMAINS AND BELONGINGS

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:23.647
AGAINST TRIBAL NATIONS WISHES

00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:25.516
FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESEARCH AND

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:28.318
TEACHING FOR FAR TOO LONG. WHILE

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:30.320
BERKELEY STILL HAS A LOT OF WORK

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:32.356
TO DO IN ACKNOWLEDGING AND

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:34.725
OWNING THE VERY PAINFUL HISTORY

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:37.060
OF HARM TO NATIVE PEOPLE, IN THE

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:38.061
LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:40.531
UNIVERSITY HAS ABANDONED

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:43.066
PRACTICES THAT SLOWED OR IMPEDED

00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:45.602
REPATRIATION AND COMPREHENSIVELY

00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:47.171
REFORMED AND REVISED OUR

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:48.705
REPATRIATION POLICIES, PROCESSES

00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:51.141
AND PERSPECTIVES. ONCE AGAIN, I

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:53.277
WANT TO CLARIFY CLEARLY. CLEARLY

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.012
STATE MY STRONG COMMITMENT TO

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:57.581
THE FULL REPATRIATION OF ALL

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.716
NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTORS AND

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:02.319
CULTURAL BELONGINGS HELD ON THE

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.820
BERKELEY CAMPUS DURING THE LAST

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:06.456
YEAR. OUR NAGPRA DEPARTMENT,

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:08.759
SITUATED IN MY OFFICE, HAS

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.527
CONTINUED TO GROW IN OUR

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:11.261
OUTREACH AND CONSULTATIONS WITH

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.297
TRIBES HAVE INCREASED,

00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:15.098
ACCELERATING PROGRESS ON

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:17.668
REPATRIATION. AS I STATED LAST

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:19.102
YEAR, ALTHOUGH I'M STILL

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.572
LEARNING ABOUT REPATRIATION

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:23.207
ISSUES, I AM FULLY COMMITTED TO

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:25.943
THE CAMPUS'S RETURN OF ALL

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:28.478
NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTORS AND

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:31.682
BELONGINGS BY THE END OF 2028,

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.550
WE WILL ACCELERATE EFFORTS TO

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:34.985
REPATRIATE ALL OTHER CULTURAL

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:37.120
ITEMS AND EXPECT TO MAKE

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:38.589
SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL HEADWAY

00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:41.091
HEADWAY IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:42.893
I HAVE A GRAPH HERE THAT SHOULD

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.128
BE IN YOUR PACKET, SHOWING OUR

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:46.930
PROGRESS DURING THE LAST FIVE

00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:49.299
YEARS. IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:51.868
ALONE, BERKELEY REPATRIATED JUST

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:57.975
OVER 2700 ANCESTORS, OVER 29,000

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:01.645
FUNERARY BELONGINGS, AND ROUGHLY

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:03.380
250 OTHER CULTURAL ITEMS, WITH

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:05.282
ADDITIONAL REPATRIATION

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.050
SCHEDULED IN THE COMING MONTHS.

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:11.722
THE CAMPUS CURRENTLY HAS 2351

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:15.993
REMAINING ANCESTORS, OR 19% OF

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.894
THE TOTAL ANCESTORS ORIGINALLY

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:20.731
HELD BY UC BERKELEY, TO. IT

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:22.899
STILL HAS THEM TO PUBLISH IN THE

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:24.368
FEDERAL REGISTER AND COMPLETE

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:26.870
THE NAGPRA PROCESS. IN THE LAST

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.639
YEAR, THE CAMPUS HAS SUBMITTED

00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:30.807
14 FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICES TO

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:34.011
GIVE ADDITIONAL CONTEXT. PRIOR

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:36.213
TO 2020, NOTICES WERE PUBLISHED

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.716
AT AN AVERAGE OF 1.5 NOTICES PER

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:42.286
YEAR, SO 14 IN THE LAST YEAR

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:45.155
PRIOR RATE 1.5 PER YEAR. WE

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:46.990
INVITED CONSULTATION WITH MORE

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:49.626
THAN 100 TRIBES ACROSS SEVEN

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:52.329
STATES AND COMPLETED 266

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:54.831
CONSULTATION MEETINGS WITH 56

00:48:54.898 --> 00:48:56.667
TRIBES AND COALITIONS. THE

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:58.869
BERKELEY CAMPUS HAS BUILT A TEAM

00:48:58.935 --> 00:49:01.405
OF NINE FULL TIME STAFF

00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:03.907
DEDICATED TO REPATRIATION, WITH

00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:05.742
SEVEN MORE FULL TIME POSITIONS

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:07.444
PLANNED IN THE COMING YEARS. THE

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:08.578
ADDITIONAL STAFF HIRED TO DO

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:10.814
TRIBAL OUTREACH HAS BEEN

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.482
CRITICAL TO ENSURING

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:14.284
RESPONSIVENESS TO CONSULTATION

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.086
AND REPATRIATION REQUESTS, AND

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:19.089
IN PROACTIVELY EXTENDING MORE

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:21.224
INVITATIONS TO CONSULT. WE HAVE

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.026
BEEN DEDICATING SIGNIFICANT

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:24.828
RESOURCES APPROXIMATELY $2

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:26.163
MILLION A YEAR, TO BUILD THIS

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:28.031
TEAM AND PROVIDE FUNDING

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:30.133
DIRECTLY TO TRIBES FOR TRAVEL,

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.968
MEALS, LODGING, COMPENSATION AND

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:35.238
OTHER COSTS NEEDED FOR

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:36.707
REPATRIATION. WE HAVE A NUMBER

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:38.542
OF VERY LARGE REPATRIATIONS THAT

00:49:38.608 --> 00:49:39.876
REQUIRE MONTHS OF CONSULTATION

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:42.679
AND IN-PERSON TIME IN THE

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:44.981
COLLECTIONS WITH TRIBAL

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:46.083
REPRESENTATIVES. OFTEN THESE

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.952
COSTS RUN OVER MULTIPLE YEARS.

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:50.253
WE HAVE ALSO BEEN BUILDING AN

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.022
ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE THAT WILL

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:55.792
BE AVAILABLE FOR REBURIAL COSTS.

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.694
I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT OUR

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.929
PRIORITY IN BUILDING THIS FUND

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:01.465
IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:04.000
TRIBES AS SOON AS THEY ARE READY

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:05.836
FOR PHYSICAL RETURNS AND

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:08.338
REBURIALS. WE DEFER TO TRIBAL

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:09.406
PREFERENCES AND TIMELINES, AND

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:11.908
MUST BE ABLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:14.177
TO THEIR REQUESTS. I'M SURE YOU

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:16.513
ARE AWARE THAT SOME TRIBES DO

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.283
NOT HAVE REBURIAL OPTIONS. WITH

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.085
UCLA'S HELP, WE HAVE EXPLORED

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:23.887
WITH TRIBES USING SPECIFIC UC

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:25.922
SITES FOR REBURIAL. WE ALSO

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.824
THINK THAT ALLOWING FOR USE OF

00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:31.461
STATE LANDS WOULD DIVERSIFY

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.597
REBURIAL OPTIONS FOR TRIBES, AND

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:35.599
COULD BE HELPFUL IN SUPPORTING

00:50:35.665 --> 00:50:37.167
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:40.003
EFFORTS AS A WHOLE TO ACCELERATE

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.772
REPATRIATION. IT IS ALSO

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:43.640
IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT UC

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.742
BERKELEY HAS BEEN A REPOSITORY

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.911
FOR NUMEROUS FEDERAL AND STATE

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:50.113
AGENCIES, WHO HISTORICALLY SENT

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.848
LARGE NUMBERS OF ANCESTORS AND

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:53.750
BELONGINGS TO OUR CAMPUS FOR

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:55.819
STORAGE. WE DO NOT HAVE THE

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:58.255
LEGAL AUTHORITY TO REPATRIATE

00:50:58.321 --> 00:50:59.990
THESE ANCESTORS AND BELONGINGS,

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.658
BUT WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.360
ENGAGING IN CONSULTATION WITH

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:05.896
BOTH TRIBES AND CONTROLLING

00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:07.631
AGENCIES IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:10.233
THE WORK OF THOSE STATE AND

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.068
FEDERAL AGENCIES, THE CAMPUS HAS

00:51:12.135 --> 00:51:14.571
BEEN DEDICATED, DEDICATING A

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:16.406
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:17.240
EFFORT TO ASSIST OUR STATE AND

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:19.376
FEDERAL PARTNERS IN THEIR

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:20.710
REPATRIATION ACTIVITIES, SO THAT

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.879
THE PROCESS FOR THOSE REMAINS

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:25.315
CAN BE EXPEDITED FOR TRIBES.

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.651
FINALLY, I AM ALSO COMMITTED TO

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.019
BUILDING CLOSER RELATIONSHIPS

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:31.488
WITH OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:33.657
TRIBAL LEADERSHIP. MY

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.392
CHANCELLOR'S NATIVE AMERICAN

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:37.627
ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS RECENTLY

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.796
BEEN RECONSTITUTED, AND I AM

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:41.298
LOOKING FORWARD TO CULTIVATING

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:44.801
THESE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS.

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:47.070
COMPREHENSIVE REPATRIATION IS AN

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:48.405
INSEPARABLE AND NECESSARY PART

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:50.307
OF UC BERKELEY'S COMMITMENT TO A

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:52.108
MORE INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY, AND TO

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:54.611
BETTER SERVE ALL THE PEOPLE OF

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:56.413
CALIFORNIA. WE ARE COMMITTED TO

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.081
ENSURING THAT OUR REPATRIATION

00:51:58.148 --> 00:52:00.350
PROCESS EMPOWERS TRIBES AND

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:02.285
HAPPENS ON A TIMELINE AND IN A

00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:04.321
MANNER THAT WORKS FOR EACH

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:06.756
TRIBE. I HAVE MADE THIS A HIGH

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.091
PRIORITY OF MY ADMINISTRATION,

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:09.893
AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING ALL

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.496
THAT I CAN TO SUPPORT THE

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:14.798
REPATRIATION PROCESS IN FULL

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.300
PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR NATIVE

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:19.002
COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:20.570
ATTENTION, AND I'M HAPPY TO

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.706
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY

OUR EFFORTS IN THE PAST HAVE

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:17.761

RECOGNIZE THAT REPATRIATION IS

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:32.976
NOT A FAVOR OR A BOX TO BE

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:36.146

00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:37.914
NATIVE AMERICAN NATIONS AND

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.450

MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AT

UC SAN DIEGO. HOWEVER, WE ALSO

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.637

BEGAN IN THIS ROLE AT THE START

00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:50.600
OF 2024, AND HAVE SERVED IN THIS

CAPACITY FOR APPROXIMATELY 20

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:53.903
MONTHS. MY PROFESSIONAL

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.705
BACKGROUND IS IN ARCHEOLOGY, AND

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:57.173
FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS, I HAVE

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.808
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:00.810
ALONGSIDE CALIFORNIA TRIBES TO

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:02.512
PROTECT THEIR CULTURAL HERITAGE

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:04.314
AND SUPPORT REPATRIATION

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.616
EFFORTS. AS UC SANTA BARBARA'S

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:08.351
REPATRIATION COORDINATOR, IT IS

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:10.086
AN HONOR TO COLLABORATE WITH

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:11.521
TRIBAL NATIONS ACROSS THE

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:13.556

RETURN OF THEIR ANCESTORS AND

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:17.894
CULTURAL ITEMS. I CANNOT EXPLAIN

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:19.829
WHY UC SANTA BARBARA HAS BEEN

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:22.232
FAR TOO SLOW TO COMPLETE

00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:24.901
REPATRIATION, NOR CAN I JUSTIFY

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.903
THE REMOVAL OF INDIGENOUS

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.571
ANCESTORS FROM THEIR HOMELANDS

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:30.373
THAT WERE BROUGHT TO OUR CAMPUS.

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.776
IT IS INEXCUSABLE. HOWEVER, I

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:35.612
CAN SPEAK TO HOW REPATRIATION

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:36.813
EFFORTS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.514
AT UC SANTA BARBARA AND SHARE

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:39.883
OUR PLAN TO COMPLETE

00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:41.384
REPATRIATION OF ALL NATIVE

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:44.187

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:45.655
AM PERSONALLY COMMITTED TO

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:47.056
CORRECTING THE FAILURE AND

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:47.957
ENSURING THAT TRIBES ARE

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:49.626
SUPPORTED IN RECLAIMING THEIR

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:52.128
ANCESTORS AND CULTURAL PROPERTY.

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:53.596

THAT EFFORT BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.598
CONSIDERED CULTURALLY

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:03.499

RECENTLY RECEIVED TWO CLAIMS FOR

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:52.815
REPATRIATION AND AS A RESULT, WE

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:54.350
HAVE SUBMITTED FIVE NOTICES,

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.651
MORE THAN DOUBLE WHAT HAD BEEN

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:04.994
THESE REPATRIATIONS BY THE END

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.430
OF OCTOBER 2025. WE HAVE ALSO

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.564

ARE HOUSED AT UC SANTA BARBARA

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:12.702
SO THAT THEY CAN INITIATE THEIR

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:14.303
CONSULTATION WITH TRIBES AS

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.738
WELL. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE IN

THEIR ANCESTORS AS WELL. TO

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:24.447
FULFILL UC SANTA BARBARA'S

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.848
REPATRIATION OBLIGATIONS, WE

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.316
HAVE INITIATED SEVERAL Kò

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:29.152
EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:30.386
COMPLETE THE REPATRIATION OF

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:31.988
NATIVE ANCESTORS BY THE END OF

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:35.258
2028. TO MEET THIS GOAL, WE

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.759
RECENTLY HIRED THREE PART TIME

EFFORTS, AND A FULL TIME STAFF

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.531
POSITION IS CURRENTLY OPEN. WE

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.466
HOPE TO RECRUIT BY THE END OF

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:47.804
OCTOBER UNTIL UNTIL 2022, OUR

WITH ONLY 10 TO 20 HOURS OF

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:54.510
SUPPORT PER WEEK. THE CREATION

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.846
OF A DEDICATED TEAM IS LONG

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.314
OVERDUE AND ESSENTIAL TO OUR

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.817
GOALS. WE HAVE ALSO CONSOLIDATED

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:02.218

CHANCELLOR'S DESIGNEE FOR

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:08.057
NAGPRA. WE ARE NO LONGER

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:09.725
AFFILIATED WITH AN ACADEMIC

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:10.893

SOFTWARE TO REPLACE OUTDATED AND

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:21.370
DISPARATE RECORDS, AND WE AIM TO

UNREPORTED NATIVE ANCESTORS OR

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:41.791
POTENTIAL CULTURAL ITEMS.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.159
PRIORITY DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:44.060

TO ESTABLISH CLEAR TIMELINES AND

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.572
BENCHMARKS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. A

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:57.807
COMPLETE REVISION OF OUR PLAN

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:00.343
WILL BE FINALIZED THIS DECEMBER

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:03.112
2025. FINALLY, WE WILL CONTINUE

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.933
THIS WORK IS COMPLETED IN A

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.002
TIMELY MANNER WITHOUT DELAY.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:29.071
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.574
ALL YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:32.909
DISCUSSION AROUND THIS. AND NOW

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:34.977
WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE DAIS

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.279
FOR ANY QUESTIONS. MEMBER

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:39.815
HARDWICK I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:42.785
AND THEN MAYBE JUST A COMMENT.

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.153
WHAT WHAT HAS CHANGED THAT YOU

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.423
FEEL LIKE NOW? AFTER 30 PLUS

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:48.558
YEARS, YOU CAN COMPLETE THIS BY

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:51.794
2028. LET ME TAKE A CRACK AT

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.563
THAT. OKAY. THAT'S A BIG

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:54.997
QUESTION. FIRST, WE WERE

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:55.865
SPENDING A LOT MORE MONEY. OKAY.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:57.800
SECOND, WE ARE HIRING A LOT OF

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:59.202
PEOPLE. AND HERE, SADLY, THE

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:01.037
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS IN

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.572
LETTING SO MANY TALENTED PEOPLE

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.307
GO IS PROVIDING US WITH AN

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.675
OPPORTUNITY TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:07.510
THE KIND OF EXPERTISE WE NEED.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.312
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT EASY TO FIND

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.447
THOSE FOLKS. THERE ARE SOME VERY

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.114
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:14.417
BACKGROUND. AND THIS IS WHY THE

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:15.618
ACADEMIC PROGRAM I MENTIONED TO

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.753
YOU IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.788
NEED TO PRODUCE MORE PEOPLE WHO

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:21.290
CAN DO THIS WORK. WE HAVE SET

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:22.992
ASIDE MORE RESOURCES. WE HAVE

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:27.263
TIGHTENED UP THE REPORTING NEEDS

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:27.863
QUARTERLY NOW COMING DIRECTLY

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:31.234
INTO MY OFFICE WITH JOSEPH

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.169
RAMOS'S HELP, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:35.204
IDENTIFY THOSE 20 BURIAL

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:36.606
POTENTIAL BURIAL GROUNDS BECAUSE

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:38.941
THAT WAS A LIMITATION BEFORE. IT

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.344
WILL NOT BE LIMITATION NOW IF IT

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.279
WORKS FOR OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS.

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.982
SO I WOULD SAY WE ARE IN PART

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:47.817
SPURRED BY THE AUDIT AND BY YOUR

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:48.884
INTEREST AND CONCERNS. AND

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:50.987
CHAIR, RAMOS'S SUPPORT AND

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.788
CONCERN, ACCELERATING ALL OF OUR

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.257
ATTENTION AND BEARING DOWN ON

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:56.125
THIS. AND THAT IS WHAT GIVES ME

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.827
CONFIDENCE WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:58.995
MEET THIS GOAL. OKAY. AND THEN

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:02.798
THE OTHER THING YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.233
EXPERTS AND CREATING MORE

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.835
EXPERTS. AND I JUST WANT TO

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:08.004
REITERATE THAT YOU HAVE SCHOLARS

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.805
AND RESOURCES, BUT THE EXPERTS

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:14.410
ARE SITTING IN THIS ROOM AND THE

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:15.444
EXPERTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:16.679
TRIBE, AND THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:17.947
HELD TO THAT STATURE BECAUSE

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:20.216
THEY HAVE THE WISDOM AND THE

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:20.883
RIGHTS AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.285
PROTECT AND INTERPRET THEIR

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.120
LEGACY. ABSOLUTELY. WHICH IS WHY

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:25.921
THAT WILL BE A COLLABORATIVE

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:27.056
EFFORT. WE WOULD NEVER DO THIS

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:30.126
ON OUR OWN. YEAH. SO THANK YOU,

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:31.994
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH,

01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:34.964
CHAIR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:37.366
JUST TO BUILD OFF OF THAT, MISS

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:39.368
NEWMAN. JUST WE'VE MADE THIS

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.837
POINT A COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:42.505
THE EXPERTISE. WE'VE HAD

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:43.639
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. AND

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:45.675
YOU JUST MENTIONED TECHNICAL

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:47.910
BACKGROUND THAT'S NEEDED. WHAT

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.378
EXACTLY IS THE TECHNICAL

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.680
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND? I MEAN,

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.915
THE REPORT THE AUDIT DOES A GOOD

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:56.452
JOB OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:58.287
TO GO THROUGH A REPATRIATION

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:01.524
PROJECT AND PROCESS. AND WHAT

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:04.694
EXACTLY ARE WE MISSING IN THAT

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.695
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND THAT IS

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.030
NEEDED TO ACTUALLY COMPLY? THE

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:10.166
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE NAGPRA

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:11.434
LEGISLATION ACTUALLY SPECIFIES

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.102
WHAT KINDS OF QUALIFICATIONS

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:14.737
PEOPLE WHO WORK AS. FOR EXAMPLE,

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.339
OUR REPATRIATION COORDINATORS

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:18.107
MUST HAVE. THERE'S PRETTY

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.475
EXTENSIVE ACADEMIC BACKGROUND.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.377
THERE'S EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS,

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.245
MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.047
ORDER TO BE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.182
WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROCESS

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:27.817
MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:29.952
FEDERAL LEGISLATION. AND, YOU

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:32.088
KNOW, WHEN I FIRST VISITED THE

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.522
BERKELEY COLLECTION, WHICH IS

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.358
ENORMOUS, I WAS TOLD BY MY

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:36.492
COLLEAGUES AT BERKELEY THAT THEY

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.027
WERE SCRAMBLING TO HIRE EXACTLY

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:39.261
THE SAME PEOPLE EVERYBODY WAS

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.830
TRYING TO HIRE, BECAUSE THERE

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:42.298
REALLY WEREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.333
MET THESE QUALIFICATIONS. WHICH

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.269
IS WHY, IN SPIRIT OF

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:48.003
REPATRIATION, WE ARE TRYING TO

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.872
ADD TO THE POOL OF PEOPLE WHO

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:51.841
COULD WHO DO HAVE THAT

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:54.110
EXPERTISE. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.544
MANY OF OUR NATIVE AMERICAN

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:56.645
STUDENTS WILL BE INTERESTED IN

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:58.714
THIS AS A POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTION

01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:00.282
TO THEIR OWN HERITAGE AND THEIR

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:02.385
OWN CAREERS. BUT THESE ARE VERY

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:03.419
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.121
IN THE LEGISLATION ABOUT WHO CAN

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:07.390
WORK ON THESE PROJECTS IN

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:08.124
COLLABORATION WITH THE TRIBES,

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.760
WHICH, AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT,

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:13.562
ARE THE REAL EXPERTS. WELL, JUST

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:16.031
TO HONE IN ON THAT, SO ARE YOU

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:18.167
LACKING EXPERTISE FROM AN

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:20.069
ARCHEOLOGICAL STANDPOINT,

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.437
ANTHROPOLOGICAL STANDPOINT,

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.272
SCIENTIFIC DNA STANDPOINT? I

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:24.673
ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT ARE

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.409
WE LACKING? BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.277
AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER HARDWICK SAID,

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.179
AND I THINK A LOT OF TRIBAL

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:31.347
LEADERS WILL SAY, WE HAVE

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:34.116
EXPERTS WITHIN THE TRIBAL

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:35.484
COMMUNITY THAT CAN DO THIS WORK,

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:37.219
AND THEY WANT TO DO THE WORK.

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:39.622
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:42.958
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE PER THE LAW

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:44.493
YOU ARE REFERRING TO. SO WHAT

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.028
EXACTLY ARE WE REFERRING TO IN

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.897
TERMS OF THE LACK OF EXPERTISE

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.698
THAT IS OUT THERE IN THE FIELD?

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:50.933
IT'S NOT THAT WE LACK THE

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.067
EXPERTISE, IT'S THAT WE LACK

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:53.903
ENOUGH PEOPLE WITH THIS

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:54.804
EXPERTISE. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.672
IS THAT IT REQUIRES FAIRLY

01:07:56.739 --> 01:08:00.943
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN RESEARCH

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.179
AREAS. TO BE SURE THE PROVENANCE

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:05.347
IS PROPERLY IDENTIFIED. THAT'S

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:08.484
THOSE ARE ARCHIVAL SKILLS,

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:11.754
OSTEOLOGY SKILLS, GEOGRAPHIC

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:14.323
SKILLS. I WOULD IF YOU REALLY

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:16.158
WANT TO HEAR THIS IN DETAIL, I

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.660
WOULD PREFER TO DEFER TO PEOPLE

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.862
WHO KNOW IT BETTER THAN I DO, TO

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:20.930
BE PERFECTLY HONEST. BUT I KNOW

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:22.531
THAT THESE ARE TECHNICAL

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.333
REQUIREMENTS AND EXPERIENCE

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.534
REQUIREMENTS, YEARS OF

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:27.603
EXPERIENCE THAT THE LEGISLATION

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.939
REQUIRES ARE OUR COLLEAGUES TO

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:31.941
HAVE IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE.

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:34.210
BUT AGAIN, MR. CHAIRMAN, I'D BE

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:36.378
HAPPY TO PROVIDE A REPORT TO YOU

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:37.646
WITH MORE ACCURATE DETAILS. I

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:39.281
THINK THAT'D BE HELPFUL, AND I

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:40.182
APPRECIATE YOU WILLING TO DO

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:43.152
THAT. HOW MANY TRIBAL EXPERTS DO

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:47.089
YOU HAVE ON STAFF IN YOUR

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:49.391
REPATRIATION COORDINATORS? THE

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:50.793
ANY OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.162
WORKING? HOW MANY NATIVE STAFF

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.331
MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE? I DON'T

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.832
ACTUALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.401
QUESTION. I WOULD SAY THAT OUR

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:00.402
PRIMARY TRIBAL EXPERTISE COMES

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:01.971
FROM THE TRIBES THEMSELVES, AS

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:04.273
THE CONSULTATION PART OF THE

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.107
CONSULTATION PROCESS, WHICH IS

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:07.877
VERY ELABORATE AND NECESSARILY

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:09.745
SO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT LEGALLY

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.146
ALLOWED TO WORK ON THOSE

01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:13.382
COLLECTIONS WITHOUT TRIBAL

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:14.517
CONSULTATION. THAT'S HOW THE LAW

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:16.652
WAS WRITTEN, AND WE RESPECT IT.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.487
SO WHEN WE SAY THAT WE'VE

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:23.025
REPATRIATED, 2800 REMAINS,

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:25.261
THAT'S BEEN DONE WITH THE

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:27.129
EXTRAORDINARY AND INTENSE, LABOR

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:28.797
INTENSIVE WORK OF OUR TRIBAL

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:30.299
PARTNERS. IN ADDITION TO THE

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.501
STAFF WE HIRE. WOULD YOU SAY

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:35.704
IT'S ZERO? WOULD YOU SAY ZERO? I

01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:36.839
ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW. MAYBE EVEN

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.874
KNOWS I DON'T KNOW, I AM A

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.643
TRIBAL MEMBER. I'M A TRIBAL

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.478
MEMBER FROM THE MESA GRANDE BAND

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:46.348
OF MISSION INDIANS IN SAN DIEGO.

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:51.887
I CAME TO UCSD AS AN EFFORT TO

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:54.390
REPATRIATE MY ANCESTORS. SO I

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:57.293
KNOW THAT I CAN ADD A

01:09:57.359 --> 01:10:00.262
PERSPECTIVE OF TRIBAL AND

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:03.766
CONTRIBUTE TO TRIBAL GOVERNANCE.

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:04.867
GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDING THE

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:06.535
TRIBAL GOVERNMENT, HOW HOW

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.837
EVERYTHING WORKS. SO I AM A

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:11.674
TRIBAL MEMBER. THANK YOU. THEN.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.209
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. AND I DO

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:15.044
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.878
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AS

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:17.513
WELL. AND I DO THINK IT'S

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.081
IMPORTANT WITH THE TRIBAL

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:20.983
CONSULTATIONS TO KNOW THAT

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.251
EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE AND

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:23.519
THAT THERE'S REPRESENTATION

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.321
WITHIN THE PROCESS, WITHIN THE

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:27.856
SYSTEM, THE UC SYSTEM FOR OUR

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:29.658
TRIBAL LEADERS AND OUR TRIBES.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.594
THE LAST POINT I WANT TO JUST

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:32.595
KIND OF DELVE INTO, AND

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.729
HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THIS

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:35.297
QUICKLY, IS IT SEEMS AS THOUGH

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:36.365
WE'RE TALKING APPLES AND

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.601
ORANGES. BETWEEN WHAT THE AUDIT

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:40.169
FOUND AND THE PRESENTATION OF

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:41.837
THE NUMBERS HERE FROM THE UC

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:46.875
SYSTEM AND THAT IS ON, YOU KNOW,

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:48.711
THE AUDIT, I THINK VERY WELL

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:49.678
SPELLS THIS OUT IN A COUPLE

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.213
DIFFERENT PLACES, BUT THERE

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.015
SEEMS TO BE AND I'LL QUOTE,

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.516
THERE ARE STARK DIFFERENCES

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:55.551
BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY'S

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:56.919
PRESENTATION OF ITS PROGRESS AND

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:59.488
THE PRESENTATION WE MAKE IN THIS

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.757
REPORT. AND WHAT THAT STEMS FROM

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.559
IS ESPECIALLY WITH THIS 2020

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:04.960
TIMELINE, WHICH I THINK LET'S BE

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:06.328
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE 2020

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:08.564
TIMELINE ACTUALLY DOES. THE

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:11.367
AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL CULTURAL

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:13.369
ITEMS THAT THE AUDIT FOUND IS IN

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:16.071
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OKAY,

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:18.273
IS YOUR NUMBER? AND THE UC

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.510
SYSTEM HAS POSTED NUMBERS AS TO

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:22.978
PROGRESS ON THEIR WEBSITE, WHICH

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:24.680
DOESN'T INCLUDE, LET'S BE CLEAR,

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:26.515
DOESN'T INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:28.884
CULTURAL ITEMS THAT YOU AND YOUR

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.085
TEAM HAVE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED.

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:33.188
IS THAT CORRECT? OUR PROMISE FOR

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:35.858
2028 REFERS TO CULTURE TO HUMAN

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:37.292
REMAINS, BECAUSE THAT IS THE

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:39.662
HIGHEST PRIORITY THAT THE TRIBES

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:41.330
HAVE EXPRESSED AND THAT WE AGREE

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:43.866
WITH. AND THE LEGISLATION CALLS

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.668
FOR THE REMAINING ITEMS. EVA CAN

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.136
PROBABLY COMMENT MORE EXPERTLY

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:49.104
THAN I CAN DO. NUMBER IN THE

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:50.706
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND THAT

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:52.207
WILL TAKE LONGER. BUT OUR

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:54.243
HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO RESPECT

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:57.279
THE NEED AND THE DEMAND FOR

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.014
REPATRIATING HUMAN REMAINS.

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:01.650
THAT'S THE THAT IS THE 2028 GOAL

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:02.985
THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO. ALONG

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:06.855
THE WAY, HOWEVER, THOUSANDS OF

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.357
CULTURAL ITEMS, FUNERARY OBJECTS

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:12.628
ARE BEING REPATRIATED AS WELL.

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.463
THAT'S HELPFUL TO CLARIFY THE

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.598
2028 THE HUMAN REMAINS. BUT I DO

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.734
THINK, THOUGH, THIS POINT ABOUT

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.169
WHAT YOU'RE REPORTING ON YOUR

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:21.270
WEBSITE AND WHAT YOU'VE

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:22.571
TESTIFIED HERE TODAY, I JUST

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:23.739
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.774
SAME PAGE. YOU ARE NOT INCLUDING

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:27.209
THE POTENTIAL CULTURAL ITEMS AND

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.610
THE CULTURAL ITEMS THAT YOU'VE

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.245
IDENTIFIED, BECAUSE THOSE

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:31.513
NUMBERS YOU'VE YOU'VE MENTIONED

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.882
A FEW IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE OF

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:35.284
PROGRESS. THAT, AGAIN, ON ITS

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:38.253
FACE SOUNDS EXTREMELY ROBUST. IF

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.089
YOU WERE TO ACTUALLY INCLUDE THE

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.356
AUDIT, THE AUDITOR'S NUMBERS OF

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:43.759
THE POTENTIAL CULTURAL ITEMS,

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.227
THOSE NUMBERS WOULD BE FAR

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:46.261
DIFFERENT AND IT'D BE FAR LOWER

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:47.763
IN TERMS OF PROGRESS. SO I GUESS

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:50.265
THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THE èC

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:52.234
PUBLISHING DATA ON ITS WEBSITE

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:53.769
AS TO ITS PROGRESS, WHICH

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:55.170
DOESN'T COINCIDE WITH ITS OWN

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:56.538
NUMBERS IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.774
CULTURAL ITEMS? AND DO YOU THINK

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:00.008
THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE THE

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:02.411
WEBSITE AND JUST BE, I THINK, A

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.445
LITTLE BIT MORE HONEST WITH THE

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:04.646
PUBLIC AS TO WHERE WE ARE,

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:05.781
BECAUSE I THINK YOUR TIMELINES

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:07.583
AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY,

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:08.617
AGAIN, ARE JUST STARKLY

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:09.551
DIFFERENT THAN THE AUDITOR'S

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.053
REPORT. I HOPE MY COMMENTS HAVE

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.821
CLARIFIED WHAT OUR COMMITMENTS

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:14.723
ARE FOR 2028. IT IS CERTAINLY

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.191
THE CASE THAT THERE ARE

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.526
MATERIALS THAT WE ARE STILL

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:18.627
DISCOVERING, AND THAT MAY BE

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:21.063
PART OF THE REASON WE HAVE

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.532
COMMITTED TO BEING SURE THAT BY

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:26.502
JUNE OF 2026, WE'VE DONE A FULL

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.637
INVENTORY OF ALL OF THE NOOKS

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:30.272
AND CRANNIES OF OUR CAMPUSES. TO

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:32.241
BE SURE, WE'VE FOUND EVERYTHING

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:35.010
THAT COULD BE PART OF THIS. I

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.812
DON'T THINK THERE IS AN

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:38.347
INCONSISTENCY, BUT I'M HAPPY TO

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:39.982
GO BACK AND REEXAMINE. WE

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:42.317
CERTAINLY ARE PROVIDING HONEST

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:43.685
INFORMATION AS WE UNDERSTAND IT,

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.120
AND WE DO THINK THAT SIGNIFICANT

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:46.889
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. BUT I

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:48.724
DID NOTE THAT THERE'S A GREAT

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.125
DEAL LEFT TO BE DONE. WE DON'T

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.327
DISAGREE WITH THAT AT ALL. YEAH,

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:53.796
I APPRECIATE THAT. I DO I DO

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.130
THINK THAT THE AUDITOR WOULD

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:55.898
DISAGREE ON WHETHER THERE IS

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:57.065
DISCREPANCY. AND AGAIN, I THINK

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:59.234
WE'RE JUST WORKING FROM THE

01:13:59.301 --> 01:13:59.835
AUDIT. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:01.770
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO USE DATA.

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:03.472
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE DO

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.941
THESE AUDITS. AND SO I THINK THE

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:06.809
AUDIT ACTUALLY WOULD WOULD

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.510
DIFFER WITH YOU ON THAT POINT. I

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:10.746
DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:11.980
DELIVERABLES FROM THIS HEARING

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:13.916
SHOULD BE WHAT IS BEING REPORTED

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:15.050
ON THE WEBSITE. AND I THINK

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.386
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:18.954
WORK VERY QUICKLY TO, TO AT

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:21.156
LEAST BE CLEARER AS TO WHAT THE

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:22.157
PROGRESS AND THE PERCENTAGES

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:23.625
ARE, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'RE

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:24.860
TALKING APPLES AND APPLES. I

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.595
THINK WE ARE TALKING APPLES AND

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:27.830
ORANGES THERE. AND I DO THINK

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:30.098
JUST TO FINALLY NOTE, MR.

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:30.866
CHAIRMAN, I'LL TURN IT OVER ON

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:33.468
PAGE 12 OF THE AUDIT. AGAIN,

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:34.803
THIS GOES BACK TO SORT OF HOW

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:37.039
WE'RE MEASURING ALL THIS. THE

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:38.073
AUDITOR TALKS ABOUT THESE

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.609
POTENTIAL CULTURAL ITEMS. AND

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:41.677
SPECIFICALLY CAMPUSES MUST

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.512
CONSULT WITH TRIBES ON THESE

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:44.980
POTENTIAL CULTURAL ITEMS. AND

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.715
INTEL CAMPUSES COMPLETE THIS

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:47.950
CONSULTATION WORK. THEY WILL NOT

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:49.651
KNOW THE TRUE CONTENT OF THE

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:50.752
CULTURAL ITEMS THAT THEY MAY

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.654
NEED TO REPATRIATE. SO I GUESS

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.656
MY QUESTION IS HUNDREDS OF

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.124
THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL CULTURAL

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.594
ITEMS EXIST, AS YOU'VE REPORTED,

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.195
WHERE ARE WE ON ACTUALLY

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:01.129
CONSULTING ON THOSE HUNDREDS OF

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:02.965
THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL ITEMS?

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.166
AND WHERE ARE THE TIMELINES ON

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.201
THAT ON THAT PROGRESS? BECAUSE I

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.703
THINK 2028 ON THE HUMAN REMAINS

01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:10.472
IS VERY THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR.

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:13.041
BUT ON THIS OTHER SUBSET OF

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:14.877
ITEMS, WHERE WHERE DO YOU THINK

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:15.611
REALISTICALLY THE TIMELINE IS

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:16.979
GOING TO BE ON CONSULTING WITH

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.547
THE TRIBES AND ACTUALLY

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.015
REPATRIATING THAT? I THINK THAT

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:22.050
IS A VERY AMBITIOUS PROBLEM THAT

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.819
YOU'VE LAID OUT. WE'RE AWARE OF

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:25.654
THAT, THAT THAT'S THE CASE. WE

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:27.155
ARE WORKING ASSIDUOUSLY ON IT.

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:29.191
IT WILL TAKE LONGER TO GET

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.993
THROUGH ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:32.494
ARE POTENTIALLY EVEN TO KNOW

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:33.962
EXACTLY HOW MANY THERE ARE,

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.731
BECAUSE THAT REQUIRES EXTENSIVE

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.532
CONSULTATION. THOUSANDS OF THESE

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:39.201
CONSULTATIONS ARE GOING ON EVERY

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.069
YEAR ON OUR CAMPUSES, AND WE ARE

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:43.305
WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO TRY

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:45.841
TO IDENTIFY ALL OF THOSE

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.943
MATERIALS WITH THOSE TRIBAL

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:48.577
CONSULTATIONS, WHICH ARE

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.846
REQUIRED IN ORDER TO REACH A

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:51.647
CONCLUSION. I'M HAPPY TO COME

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.782
BACK TO YOU WITH FURTHER

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:54.917
INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE ASKING

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.151
FOR. I PROVIDED YOU WITH WHAT I

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:59.121
KNOW AND I STAND BY IT, BUT I'M

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:00.622
HAPPY TO TRY TO RECONCILE WHERE

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:01.790
THERE WHERE THERE ARE

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.091
DIFFERENCES. I THINK IT'S THAT

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.359
IN THAT POTENTIAL REALM WHERE

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:05.694
THAT PROBABLY IS THE CASE, I

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:07.462
APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK WHAT'S

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:08.664
REALLY IMPORTANT IS ACTUALLY TO

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.365
MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:11.333
INTERNALLY KEEPING TRACK OF

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.201
THAT, THOSE PERCENTAGES, THOSE

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:14.436
MEETINGS. AND I THINK PUBLICLY

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:15.604
PUBLISHING THAT BECAUSE IF

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:16.838
YOU'RE GOING TO PUBLISH ONE

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.941
NUMBER, I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:19.875
PUBLISH THE OTHER SO THAT

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.043
EVERYONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:22.911
HAPPENING. AND I THINK THAT WILL

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:24.379
HELP US ALL STAY ACCOUNTABLE. SO

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.415
I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENTS

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:27.916
AND APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:30.419
ANSWERS. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:33.088
CHAIR. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH,

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:36.925
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. THANK

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:39.428
YOU. MY QUESTION IS FOR THE

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:40.529
REPATRIATION COORDINATOR FROM

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:43.065
FROM SANTA BARBARA. THE AUDIT

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:46.368
DID MENTION THAT THERE ARE

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.636
ASTOUNDING OUTSTANDING LOANS OF

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.771
DOZENS OF BOXES OF POTENTIAL

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:52.307
CULTURAL ITEMS. WHAT IS THE

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:54.543
STATUS OF THOSE ITEMS THAT WERE

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.745
IDENTIFIED AS OUTSTANDING IN THE

01:16:56.812 --> 01:17:01.450
AUDIT? THOSE ARE SCHEDULED TO BE

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:03.218
DELIVERED BY FREIGHT IN

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.886
SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, AS WELL

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.722
AS ONE TRANSPORTATION FROM LOS

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:08.557
ANGELES. SO THEY ARE ALL

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:09.758
SCHEDULED TO BE COMING HOME

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:12.861
SOON. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SURE.

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:14.096
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:15.797
THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:17.165
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:20.035
DÍAS. WE DO HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:23.872
QUESTIONS MYSELF, CERTAINLY WITH

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.140
THE PANELISTS THAT ARE HERE

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:28.010
TODAY. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING,

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:31.013
TRYING TO BRING AND IDENTIFY

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.581
BARRIERS THAT NEED TO BE

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:34.916
ADDRESSED EITHER THROUGH STATUTE

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:38.553
OR POLICY. BUT 35 YEARS IS A

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:41.356
LONG TIME, AND DURING THAT TIME

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:43.625
THERE'S BEEN DIFFERENT

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:44.960
CHANCELLORS, DIFFERENT PROVOSTS,

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:46.795
DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. SO

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:49.031
HOW DO WE GET TO A POINT TO

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:53.235
WHERE REPATRIATION IS A TOP

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:56.204
PRIORITY OF THE UC SYSTEM, AND

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:57.773
HOW WOULD THAT BE EMBEDDED IN

01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:00.275
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE? BECAUSE

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:02.210
THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE'RE

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:04.046
HEADED. SO DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.814
COMMENTS OR IDEAS ON HOW WE

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:07.682
COULD GET TO THAT POINT? IT'S A

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:09.217
VERY FAIR POINT, MR. CHAIRMAN,

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:10.986
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:12.554
THAT WE HAVE INSTITUTIONALIZED

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:14.122
THIS COMMITMENT. SO IT DOESN'T

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:15.290
MATTER WHO'S SITTING IN MY SEAT.

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:17.025
THAT COMMITMENT WILL REMAIN.

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:18.894
THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUARTERLY

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.961
REPORTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:21.763
WHICH OF US IS IN WHICH SEAT

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.465
THEY ARE GOING TO BE THERE

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.733
INDEFINITELY. THE COMMITMENT OF

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.068
FUNDING IS COMING FROM THE

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:28.136
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT,

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:29.204
REGARDLESS OF WHICH PRESIDENT IS

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:30.972
SITTING IN THAT SEAT. AND WE

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.407
WILL BE MONITORING VERY

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:34.209
CAREFULLY HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:36.211
SPENT AND THAT THEY ARE BEING

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:37.846
SPENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:39.047
PROVISIONS THAT WE'VE MADE. BUT

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:41.149
MOST IMPORTANT, WE HAVE A VERY,

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.551
I THINK, VERY STRONG

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.052
UNDERSTANDING WITH OUR CAMPUS

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:46.221
LEADERSHIP. CHANCELLOR LYONS IS

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:48.323
HERE TODAY TO UNDERLIE THAT, AND

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.058
THAT IS A COMMITMENT RIGHT AT

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:51.626
THE TOP, WHICH IN A SENSE

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:53.095
SUPERSEDES ALL OF US, BECAUSE WE

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.763
DO RECOGNIZE THIS IS AN

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.631
EXTRAORDINARILY AND IMPORTANT

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:58.400
RESPONSIBILITY FOR US, FOR THE

01:18:58.467 --> 01:18:59.534
UNIVERSITY AS A WHOLE,

01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:00.702
REGARDLESS OF WHO OF US IS

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:03.071
SITTING IN THESE CHAIRS. AND IF

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:04.005
I MAY JUST GIVE A CONCRETE

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:05.240
EXAMPLE OF THAT

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:05.874
INSTITUTIONALIZATION AT

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.143
BERKELEY. SO I MENTIONED A

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.911
CHANCELLOR'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:12.047
ON ON NAGPRA AND MORE WIDELY ON

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:14.249
TRIBAL AFFAIRS THAT DIRECTLY

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:16.751
CONNECTS TO ME. THE PERSON WHO'S

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.220
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IS A DIRECT

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:19.754
REPORT OF MINE THAT DIDN'T USED

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.923
TO BE TRUE. THAT WOULD HAVE TO

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.358
BE CHANGED IF SOMEBODY IF A NEW

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:25.727
CHANCELLOR CAME IN, I HAVE NO,

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:26.962
THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN ANYTIME

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.630
SOON. BUT ANYWAY, THOSE ARE JUST

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:30.832
SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF HOW WE

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:33.635
HARDWIRE. IT'S RIGHT AT THE TOP

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:36.204
OF THE ORGANIZATION. NOW,

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:39.174
THERE'S ALSO WHEN CHANCELLOR

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:41.209
COMES IN YOURSELF, MR. LYONS,

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:42.811
THERE'S CERTAIN PRIORITIES THAT

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.746
YOU TAKE ON AS A STRUCTURE OF

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:47.315
THE WHOLE UC SYSTEM, QUALITY

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:48.416
EDUCATION, ENSURING THOSE TYPES

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:50.218
OF THINGS, THOSE THINGS ARE

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:52.821
EMBEDDED. AND REPATRIATION OVER

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.990
THE YEARS HASN'T BEEN AT THE TOP

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:56.691
OF THE PRIORITY. WE'RE HEARING

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.527
NOW SOME WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE.

01:19:58.593 --> 01:20:01.296
HOW DO WE GET THE REPATRIATION?

01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:02.931
AGAIN, THIS IS LAW THAT'S BEEN

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.966
IN EFFECT FOR 35 YEARS. THERE'S

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:06.134
BEEN COMPLIANCE AND THE

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:06.768
FRUSTRATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.670
INDIAN PEOPLE, INDIAN PEOPLE IN

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.105
GENERAL FROM THE UNITED STATES.

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:12.507
HOW DO WE GET THAT NOW EMBEDDED

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:14.743
TO THOSE PRIORITIES OF QUALITY

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:17.512
EDUCATION, ENSURING INSTITUTION,

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:19.047
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS GETS TO

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:20.849
THAT LEVEL WHERE WHEN A NEW

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:21.883
CHANCELLOR COMES IN, THOSE ARE

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:24.085
THINGS THEY CANNOT DEFER FROM

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.655
BUT HAVE TO IMPLEMENT. MAYBE I

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:28.390
CAN HELP WITH THIS. MR.

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:29.858
CHAIRMAN, AS CHANCELLOR LYONS

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:32.761
WILL WILL NOTE, EVERY YEAR EVERY

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.095
CAMPUS MUST COME TO THE

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.197
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE WITH A

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:36.464
COMPLETE ACCOUNTING OF THEIR

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:37.499
ACHIEVEMENTS IN A VARIETY OF

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:42.437
DIFFERENT AREAS. UNTIL MY TIME,

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:43.972
REPATRIATION WAS NOT ONE OF THE

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.106
CATEGORIES THEY WERE REQUIRED TO

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:47.075
REPORT ON. IT IS NOW. SO EVERY

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.910
YEAR WHEN WE REVIEW, WHEN THE

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:50.045
PRESIDENT REVIEWS THE

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.713
PERFORMANCE OF EACH CAMPUS ON A

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.216
WIDE RANGE OF METRICS,

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:56.117
REPATRIATION AND PROGRESS TOWARD

01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:57.552
REPATRIATION IS NOW SQUARELY IN

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:58.587
THAT PRIORITY LIST THAT THEY

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.822
MUST RESPOND TO. AND THAT IS AN

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:02.624
IMPORTANT ACCOUNTABILITY DEVICE.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:03.725
WHEN YOU ADD TO THAT, THE

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.093
QUARTERLY REPORTS, WHICH MY

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.362
OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.030
WHICH MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:10.265
RECEIVING THOSE REPORTS MUST

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:11.833
TELL ME IF ANYBODY'S FALLING

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.001
SHORT ON THOSE QUARTERLY, AND

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:14.836
THEN WE WILL INTERVENE TO FIND

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:17.305
OUT WHY. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.140
DEVICES WE USE TO TRY TO

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.508
INSTANTIATE THIS AS A SYSTEM

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:21.810
PRIORITY. BUT I THINK THE MOST

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:23.712
IMPORTANT IS THE ANNUAL REPORT,

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:25.413
WHICH EACH CAMPUS MUST COME

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.715
FORWARD WITH AND WHICH WE

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:28.116
SCRUTINIZE VERY CAREFULLY, NOW

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:29.918
REQUIRES REPATRIATION AS ONE OF

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:32.087
THOSE ITEMS THAT ARE HIGHEST

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:35.323
PRIORITY. THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:41.129
AND I THINK WE STILL ARE. REALLY

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:42.530
LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF HOW DO

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:43.999
WE GET TO THAT POINT? WOULD IT

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:46.434
BE STATUTE, WOULD IT BE A èC

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:49.004
BODY THAT THAT APPROVES THAT AS

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.273
FAR AS LONG LASTING PROCEDURES?

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:53.041
I MEAN, WE'RE GOING TO GO

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:53.975
THROUGH SOME OTHER QUESTIONS,

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:55.543
AND A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:56.911
GEARED TOWARDS COULD BE GEARED

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:57.946
TOWARDS THE POSITIONS YOU'RE

01:21:58.013 --> 01:22:00.849
YOU'RE HOLDING NOW. SO WE WANT

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:02.817
TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THOSE

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:04.586
ISSUES. BUT WE NEED TO GET TO

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:08.456
WHERE REPATRIATION. IT'S A GREAT

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:09.557
HISTORICAL TRAUMA AND

01:22:09.624 --> 01:22:10.925
CONTEMPORARY TRAUMA TOWARDS

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.861
INDIAN PEOPLE. HOW DO WE RESOLVE

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.562
THAT? HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD? WE

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:15.964
TALKED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IF

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:17.832
FIELD SCHOOLS WERE GOING TO MOVE

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.000
FORWARD, THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:20.635
BLESSING OF THE TRIBE, THAT

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:21.236
THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING OUT TO

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:23.238
UNCOVER ARTIFACTS ON THAT. THEY

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:24.806
HAVE TO HAVE THE BLESSING OF THE

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:26.174
TRIBE BEFORE WE START TO MOVE

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:28.043
FORWARD AND GET TO WHERE WE'RE

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.144
AT AGAIN, WITH REMAINS BEING IN

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.546
THE ARCHIVES AND FACILITIES. SO

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.615
WE HAVE TO START DOING A BETTER

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:35.483
JOB. AND YOU'VE BEEN THROWING

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:38.687
OUT THE 2028. BUT YET THE AUDIT

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.121
IDENTIFIES UC BERKELEY AS ONE OF

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:41.723
THE ONES THAT THERE THAT EVEN IF

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.458
THEY COMPLIED WITH THINGS MOVING

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:44.826
FORWARD, IT WOULD TAKE THEM

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.961
UNTIL 2089. SO ARE YOU

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:48.496
DISCREDITING THAT PART OF THE

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:50.632
AUDIT TO WHERE NOW YOU'RE MOVING

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:52.867
TO 2028? SO ARE WE LOOKING AT

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.369
2028 FOR FULL REPATRIATION FROM

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:57.005
THE UC SYSTEM OF HUMAN REMAINS?

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:58.506
MR. CHAIRMAN, BECAUSE WE

01:22:58.573 --> 01:22:59.974
UNDERSTOOD THAT TO BE THE

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:00.775
HIGHEST PRIORITY AND THAT IS

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.777
WHAT WE WERE COMMITTING TO. WE

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:03.945
REALIZED THAT THE COLLECTIONS AT

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:05.647
BERKELEY AND ELSEWHERE WILL TAKE

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:06.881
THEIR FULL COLLECTIONS, WILL

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:09.951
TAKE LONGER TO PURSUE. BUT WE

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:11.920
THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS THE

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:13.254
EXPRESSED DESIRE OF THE TRIBES

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:15.090
TO BRING THEIR PEOPLE HOME. AND

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:16.858
THAT IS WHAT WE'VE PLACED AS OUR

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:18.760
HIGHEST PRIORITY ALONGSIDE ALL

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.096
OF THE OTHER WORK THAT NEEDS TO

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:22.197
BE DONE ON FUNERARY REMAINS AND

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:24.466
CULTURAL ITEMS. SO YOU'RE

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:26.334
HOLDING TO THE YEAR 2028 FOR

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:29.070
FULL REPATRIATION OF REMAINS IN

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.005
YOUR ARCHIVES. THAT IS WHAT WE

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:32.941
ARE AIMING TO ACHIEVE. YES, AND

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:34.209
WE'VE PUT THE RESOURCES BEHIND

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.944
IT AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND IT. AND

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.513
THAT IS OUR THAT IS OUR GOAL.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.681
AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:42.050
WHEN THE AUDIT WAS DONE, IT WAS

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:42.884
DONE ON FOUR CAMPUSES. AND HOW

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.586
MANY CAMPUSES DOES YOU SEE

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.721
ACTUALLY CURRENTLY HAVE NOW?

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:48.656
WELL, ALTOGETHER WE HAVE TEN

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:51.259
CAMPUSES. SO WE AUDIT IT FOR AND

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:54.229
EVERY TIME WE GO OUT AND START

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.330
TO DO MORE RESEARCH DATA

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:57.165
COLLECTION, WE UNCOVER MORE

01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:58.400
REMAINS. SO ARE YOU TAKING THAT

01:23:58.466 --> 01:24:01.636
INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE GROWTH

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.271
VERSUS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW TO

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:05.774
COMPLY WITH 2028? OUR OUR

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.276
COMMITMENTS ARE SYSTEM WIDE. SO

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:10.745
THERE WAS YES, OUR COMMITMENTS

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:13.715
ARE SYSTEM WIDE. SO THERE ALSO

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:16.684
WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT AND

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:18.019
LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.988
SYSTEM WIDE POLICIES. WE HAVE

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:22.390
FROM CAMPUSES, UC SANTA BARBARA

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:23.792
THAT'S MOVING FORWARD ON ON

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:25.693
CERTAIN THINGS IS WHAT THEY'RE

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.929
MOVING FORWARD ON ALSO SYSTEM

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:30.732
WIDE FOR ALL 11 CAMPUSES. ALL OF

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:33.168
OUR CAMPUSES ARE UNDER THE SAME

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.003
SET OF EXPECTATIONS AND THE SAME

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:36.037
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BACK TO

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:38.173
THE SYSTEM OFFICE AND THE SAME

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:39.641
QUARTERLY REPORTS. ALL OF THEM

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:42.143
ARE THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.779
ALSO, THE AUDIT DID UNCOVER THAT

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:47.649
EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS FINANCIAL

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:49.384
COMMITMENT, NOT ALL OF THE

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.152
FINANCIAL COMMITTED DOLLARS WERE

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:52.887
USED TO GO TOWARDS A PRIORITY

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:54.823
THAT WAS THERE. YES. I THINK

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.424
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:58.326
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. THAT'S STILL

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:01.563
WITHIN THE SINCERE SPIRIT OF

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:04.098
REPATRIATION. WHEN OUR CAMPUSES

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:06.034
IDENTIFY MATERIALS AND PUBLISH

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.769
THEM IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER,

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.571
THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:10.205
OUTSTANDING EXPENSES THAT WILL

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:12.340
NEED TO BE COVERED WHEN THOSE

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:13.875
MATERIALS ARE FINALLY

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.543
TRANSPORTED HOME, AND THEY ARE

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.111
RESERVING THAT FUNDING TO MAKE

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:19.314
SURE IT'S THERE IN ORDER TO

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.715
ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. SO THIS

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.617
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESERVES

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:24.719
THERE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:25.787
ISN'T ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE.

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.956
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE AN

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.724
EARMARK, IF YOU WILL, BUT IT'S

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.092
HOLDING THOSE FUNDS SO THAT

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:32.961
THEIR COMMITMENTS CAN BE

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:35.063
REALIZED. SO I DO THINK IT'S

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:35.763
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:36.998
UNDERSTAND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.933
THE WORK ISN'T BEING DONE. IT'S

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.302
THE FUNDING IS BEING SET ASIDE

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:42.337
TO ACCOMPLISH A PURPOSE THAT

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:44.005
TAKES SOME TIME BETWEEN THE

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.573
POINT OF PUBLICATION, THE POINT

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.009
OF ACTUAL PHYSICAL MOVEMENT. IT

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:51.980
CAN BE A YEAR OR MORE. THANK YOU

01:25:52.046 --> 01:25:57.585
FOR THAT. AND ALSO WE WANTED TO

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:59.621
HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING THAT THE UC

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.623
IS DOING. WE ARE RUNNING A

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:03.491
CURRENT BILL ON CAL STATE

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:05.326
UNIVERSITIES TO DO A SURPLUS OF

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:07.595
THEIR LAND HOLDINGS, TO LOOK AT

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.197
A BARRIER THAT WE'VE SEEN AND

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:11.065
COME UP IN DIFFERENT HEARINGS OF

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:12.834
SOME TRIBES NOT HAVING LAND BASE

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:14.235
FOR PROPER REBURIAL. AS WORST

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:16.037
CASE SCENARIO, I HAD TO MOVE A

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:19.040
PIECE OF STATUTE LEGISLATION TO

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:21.142
HAVE THAT MOVE FORWARD. THE UCS

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.944
HAVE TAKEN THAT ON ON THEIR OWN

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.712
AND HAVE MOVED FORWARD TO

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:27.782
IDENTIFY WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.083
REBURIALS TO MOVE TOWARDS THE

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:30.885
EFFORT OF GETTING REPATRIATION

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:32.987
AND REMAINS BACK INTO THE GROUND

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:35.056
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.591
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:38.226
THAT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY THAT

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:40.395
THAT IS BEING DONE, THAT THERE

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.262
IS INPUT FROM THE TRIBAL

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:42.931
COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:44.632
ARE ADDRESSING THAT. SO I WANTED

01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:46.834
TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND REALLY

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.436
SHOW THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.972
35 YEARS AGO TO THE BODY THAT

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.074
WE'RE TALKING TO NOW, WOULD IT

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:54.909
IS IT BECAUSE OF THREE AUDITS

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:57.779
THAT THE STATE HAS DONE? IS IT

01:26:57.845 --> 01:26:59.981
ULTIMATELY THE UCS UNDERSTANDING

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.916
THE HORRIFIC TREATMENT TOWARDS

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:03.551
NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT THE

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:04.786
REMAINS THAT ARE IN THEIR

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.287
ARCHIVES ARE NOT TO BE

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:08.189
CONSIDERED TROPHIES? IS THAT

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:11.059
TYPE OF PERSONA OF THE UC SYSTEM

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:13.661
STARTING TO CHANGE FROM WITHIN?

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:16.831
MR. RAMOS? MY OWN PERSONAL

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:17.966
OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEAK WITH YOU

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:20.134
HAVE HELPED ME A GREAT DEAL TO

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:21.269
UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY, AND

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:22.670
THAT, IN TURN, HAS INSPIRED ME

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.405
AND MY COLLEAGUES TO TURN BACK

01:27:24.472 --> 01:27:26.574
TO THE RESOURCES WE HAVE AND

01:27:26.641 --> 01:27:28.810
ASK, WHAT CAN WE DO TO DO A

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.545
BETTER JOB? THAT IS A VERY

01:27:30.612 --> 01:27:32.413
SINCERE COMMITMENT ON OUR PART,

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.482
BUT I THINK YOU PERSONALLY AND

01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:35.717
OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS HAVE HELPED

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.719
US UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:39.587
BARRIERS ARE, EVEN KNOWING THAT

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:41.689
THE ABSENCE OF POTENTIAL LAND

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:44.092
WAS A HUGE BARRIER WAS

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:45.960
IMPORTANT. THE REASON WHY UCLA

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:48.463
HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL,

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:50.765
REPATRIATING 99.9% OF THE

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:52.233
ANCESTORS THEY HELD, IS THAT

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.002
THEY IDENTIFIED LAND THAT WAS

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:55.370
PART OF THE NATURAL RESERVE

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:56.771
SYSTEM THAT WAS APPROPRIATE TO

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:57.939
THEIR TRIBAL PARTNERS. WELL,

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.707
WE'VE NOW DONE THAT FOR THE

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:01.509
WHOLE SYSTEM, AND MY HOPE IS

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:02.644
THAT WE'LL HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:05.113
EFFECT IT'S HAD AT UCLA. BUT OUR

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:06.147
UNDERSTANDING, MY UNDERSTANDING

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:07.715
OF WHERE THE BARRIERS LIE AND

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:09.751
THEN WHERE THE SOLUTIONS LIE

01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:11.119
COMES FROM THESE CONVERSATIONS,

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:12.954
AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THEM. THE

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.355
AUDIT ALSO HAS BEEN VERY

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:16.190
HELPFUL. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:19.160
NEEDS THAT WE MUST ADDRESS, AND

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:22.363
THE AUDIT DOES HAVE SEVERAL

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.464
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:26.701
LEGISLATURE. AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:28.069
WILL BE TAKING THOSE INTO

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:31.105
ACCOUNT, AS WELL AS WHAT'S BEEN

01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:32.573
TESTIFIED HERE TODAY. WITH THE

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.476
YEAR 2028, I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:36.978
START TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:38.780
FOR ONGOING DISCUSSION. I DO

01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:43.718
THINK THAT POTENTIAL STATUTES TO

01:28:43.785 --> 01:28:46.421
EMBED THIS AS A TOP PRIORITY IS

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:49.390
ALSO WORTH DISCUSSION. WE'VE

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.492
ALSO TALKED ABOUT BARRIERS, AND

01:28:51.559 --> 01:28:53.127
UC'S HAVE MOVED FORWARD WITH A

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:54.696
CERTIFICATE PROGRAM TO START TO

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:56.998
BRING IN THOSE. AND I WANTED TO

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.366
SEE IF YOU COULD ENLIGHTEN

01:28:58.433 --> 01:29:01.302
MEMBERS HERE AND THOSE IN THE

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:03.771
CHAMBERS ON THE NECESSITY OF

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:07.041
THAT OF NAGPRA VERSUS NAGPRA AND

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:09.644
THOSE REQUIREMENTS THERE. AGAIN,

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:11.345
THERE ARE VERY TECHNICAL

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:12.313
REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICIPATING

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.148
IN THE REPATRIATION PROCESS, AND

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:16.384
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:17.318
EXTRAORDINARY COORDINATORS

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:18.553
WHO'VE MET THOSE REQUIREMENTS,

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:20.388
BUT ARE NOT VERY MANY OF THOSE

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:22.123
PEOPLE. AND SO, AS AN

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.524
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, WE ARE

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.860
HOPING TO ADDRESS THIS NOT JUST

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:27.428
FOR OURSELVES, BUT TO PROVIDE

01:29:27.495 --> 01:29:29.263
EXPERTISE THAT CSU WOULD BE ABLE

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.832
TO USE, THAT THE CALTRANS

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:32.967
SYSTEM, ANYBODY WHO HOLDS THESE

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:34.035
COLLECTIONS IS GOING TO NEED,

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.737
AND THE TRIBES THEMSELVES FOR

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:36.838
THAT MATTER. SO WE'RE HOPING

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:38.139
THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WILL

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:39.741
THINK OF THIS AS A POTENTIAL

01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:41.743
CAREER. THAT WOULD BE A WAY OF

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.411
CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR OWN TRIBAL

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:44.812
HERITAGE AND SOLVE THIS

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.848
EGREGIOUS PROBLEM. BUT IN

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:48.549
HONESTY, IT'S SOMETHING WE FELT

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:50.551
AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION CAN

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.620
DO. NO OTHER INSTITUTION CAN DO

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:54.288
THAT, AND WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:56.357
BE A CONTRIBUTION TO A NATIONAL

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:58.626
PROBLEM. WE ASSESSED THIS. THERE

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:00.862
ARE MORE THAN 400 INSTITUTIONS

01:30:00.928 --> 01:30:02.296
THAT NEED TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:03.865
THIS EXPERTISE. THERE ARE NO

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:05.099
OTHER UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:07.435
TRYING TO DO THIS. SO AGAIN, MY

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:09.303
HOPE IS THAT IT GOES DEEPER THAN

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:10.605
JUST WHAT OUR LEGAL COMMITMENTS

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:12.740
ARE TO OUR MORAL COMMITMENTS,

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.642
OUR SOCIAL COMMITMENTS, AND TO

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.310
THE THINGS THAT ONLY A

01:30:16.377 --> 01:30:17.812
UNIVERSITY CAN DO TO BE HELPFUL

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:20.782
TO SOLVING A NATIONAL

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:21.582
CATASTROPHE. THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:24.418
AND WE'D BE WE WOULD LOOK

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:25.920
FORWARD TO GETTING ANY OF THE

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:26.921
CRITERIA FOR THAT CERTIFICATE

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:29.023
PROGRAM THAT WE COULD HELP

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.325
SPREAD OUT THROUGH THE TRIBAL

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:33.761
COMMUNITIES. BUT WE ALSO, FOR MY

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:35.396
COLLEAGUES AND THOSE IN THE

01:30:35.463 --> 01:30:38.533
CHAMBERS WITH THE NAGPRA FEDERAL

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:41.369
VERSUS THE STATE NAGPRA THERE,

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:43.971
WE DO KNOW THAT A LOT OF REMAINS

01:30:44.038 --> 01:30:46.073
IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE UC SYSTEM

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:48.042
AND CAL STATES AND COMMUNITY

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:52.847
COLLEGES ARE WERE WERE

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:55.683
INADVERTENTLY DUG UP BEFORE

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.451
POSSIBLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:59.987
THAT HAVE TIES TO DIFFERENT

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.556
TRIBES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:02.523
CALIFORNIA. IN THIS NATION,

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:03.991
HAWAIIAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS

01:31:04.058 --> 01:31:06.194
THAT VISITED THESE AREAS. BUT WE

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.629
ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO GET

01:31:08.696 --> 01:31:10.097
THOSE REMAINS BACK INTO THE

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:11.732
GROUND. SO IDENTIFYING BARRIERS

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.267
LIKE THE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM,

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:14.402
DIFFERENT BARRIERS THAT ARE

01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:15.937
THERE, ARE THERE OTHER BARRIERS

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.972
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO BRING

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:21.242
FORWARD TO THIS JOINT COMMITTEE

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:23.744
THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.179
MIGHT NOT EVEN BE IN THE

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:28.382
AUDITOR'S REPORT. I KNOW THAT

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:30.184
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:32.086
MAKING SURE THAT OUR TRIBAL

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:33.855
PARTNERS ACTUALLY HAVE THE TIME

01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:35.957
AND BANDWIDTH THEMSELVES,

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.491
BECAUSE WE ARE ASKING FOR A

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:38.893
GREAT DEAL OF THEIR OWN

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.261
COMMITMENT AND TIME. AND THEY

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:42.196
HAVE OTHER THEY HAVE JOBS, THEY

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:44.632
HAVE LIVES. IT'S NOT A SIMPLE

01:31:44.699 --> 01:31:47.168
MATTER FOR THEM TO SET ASIDE

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:49.370
THAT TIME. THIS IS WHY WE'VE

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:51.873
TRIED TO HELP BY PROVIDING MORE

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:53.674
RESOURCES FOR THEM TO MAKE THAT

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:55.843
AN EASIER, AN EASIER CHORE, SO

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.912
TO SPEAK. BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT

01:31:57.979 --> 01:32:00.414
IF WE'RE ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS

01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:02.250
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM, THAT THAT

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:03.351
THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WILL

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:04.919
FIND THIS OF INTEREST, BECAUSE

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:07.021
THEY ALSO NEED MORE PEOPLE, IN A

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:09.090
SENSE, TO HELP WITH THIS

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.524
IDENTIFICATION AND CONSULTATION

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.894
PROCESS. AND IF WE WERE ABLE TO

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.862
HELP THE CHILDREN OF THE TRIBES

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:17.064
BECOME EXPERTS WITH THESE

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:19.200
TECHNICAL SKILLS, THAT THAT WILL

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:21.736
AMPLIFY THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:24.906
WHO CAN BE HELPFUL. WELL, THANK

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:26.340
YOU FOR THAT. AND WE'LL HEAR

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:28.175
FROM OUR NEXT PANEL ON SOME OF

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:28.809
THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT'S GOING

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:32.179
ON HERE. AND MR. LYONS,

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:33.614
CHANCELLOR, YOU MENTIONED THAT

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:35.716
THERE'S ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:36.951
REPATRIATED, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:38.486
THE AUTHORITY TO REPATRIATE

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:40.121
THEM. CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE

01:32:40.187 --> 01:32:41.856
BIT MORE ON THAT? YEAH, THERE

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:43.124
ARE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM WITH

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:44.392
GREATER EXPERTISE THAN I HAVE.

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:47.628
BUT BUT THE AGENCIES, STATE

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:50.031
AGENCIES, FOR EXAMPLE, IF A ROAD

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.399
IS BEING CONSTRUCTED AND THINGS

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:54.402
ARE BEING DUG UP, IT WOULD BE A

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:56.337
STATE AGENCY THAT THAT WOULD

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:59.073
TAKE INITIAL POSSESSION OF THOSE

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.108
REMAINS. AND OVER MANY DECADES,

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:03.477
STATE AGENCIES HAVE ENTRUSTED

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:05.746
BERKELEY FOR UC BERKELEY FOR

01:33:05.813 --> 01:33:07.181
STORING THOSE REMAINS. WE ARE

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.983
NOT THE LEGAL OWNER OF THE

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.384
REMAINS. THE FEDERAL AGENCY OR

01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:14.188
THE STATE AGENCY IS THE OWNER WE

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.490
ARE STORING AND SUPPORTING. BUT

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:18.259
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE LEGAL

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:21.996
RIGHT TO REPATRIATE THEM. WE TRY

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:24.265
TO SUPPORT THEIR REPATRIATION.

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:29.737
SO THE YEAR 2028 TO REPATRIATE

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:31.038
THE HUMAN REMAINS THAT ARE IN

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:33.374
YOUR ARCHIVES COULD BE A

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:34.976
BARRIER, COULD BE THAT YOU DON'T

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:35.843
HAVE THE AUTHORITY FOR SOME OF

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.778
THE STATE AGENCIES INADVERTENT

01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:39.113
DISCOVERY OF NATIVE AMERICAN

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.548
REMAINS. I BELIEVE THAT TO BE

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:42.016
CORRECT. AND IF WE COULD WALK

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:44.185
THROUGH THAT PROCESS, A STATE

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:47.421
AGENCY IS OUT THERE, LEVIES,

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:48.155
TRANSPORTATION, ALL THOSE

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:49.924
DIFFERENT THINGS. INADVERTENT

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:51.726
DISCOVERY OF REMAINS COME UP.

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:54.962
THEY USE THE UC SYSTEM AS A

01:33:55.029 --> 01:33:57.465
REPOSITORY CURATORIAL FACILITY

01:33:57.531 --> 01:33:59.600
TO COMPLY WITH LAW. AND THEN

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:02.069
THOSE REMAINS STAY IN BASICALLY

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:03.604
IN YOUR CARE OR IN YOUR

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:06.240
POSSESSION. POSSESSION. CAN WE

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:08.876
GET AN IDEA OF HOW MANY REMAINS

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:10.711
ARE ACTUALLY IN THE POSSESSION

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:14.482
OF THE UCS THAT FALL UNDER THAT

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:17.218
CRITERIA? I DON'T HAVE THE

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:20.154
NUMBER FOR THE WHOLE OF THE UCS,

01:34:20.221 --> 01:34:21.589
BUT IT'S A GOOD OBJECTIVE THAT

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:24.792
THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THEN

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:25.893
LEGISLATIVE WISE, WITH

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.395
COLLEAGUES ON THIS DAIS, WE

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:29.930
COULD START TO LOOK AT HOLDING

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:32.099
THOSE AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE. WE

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.935
DID TALK ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:37.138
IF FIELD SCHOOLS WERE GOING TO

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:38.239
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN, THAT THEY

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:39.607
HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:40.908
BLESSING OF THE TRIBES THAT ARE

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.877
GOING TO BE GOING OUT THERE. I

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:45.312
THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE START TO

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:46.180
MOVE FORWARD ON THE STATE

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:47.948
AGENCIES ALSO. AND THANK YOU FOR

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:49.917
BRINGING BRINGING THAT UP. I

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:54.021
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S. THOUGHT

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.523
PROCESS ON THIS DAIS, BUT I

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:56.590
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:57.625
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GET

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:59.460
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION BACK

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:00.895
AND COULD BE POTENTIALLY A

01:35:00.961 --> 01:35:03.097
REQUEST OF AN AUDIT THROUGH THE

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:04.799
COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO THOSE

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:08.803
AREAS, POTENTIALLY. BUT WE ALSO

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:12.406
WANTED TO IDENTIFY A COUPLE

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:14.909
THINGS THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD,

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:18.179
THAT WE WANT TO SEE COMPLIANCE

01:35:18.245 --> 01:35:21.348
WITH THE LAW. ONE IN THE AUDIT

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:22.883
IDENTIFIES 2089. AND YOU'RE

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.952
SAYING THAT BY 2028, YOU'RE

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:27.054
GOING TO MAKE IT A POLICY THAT

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:28.622
THE UCS WILL REPATRIATE THE

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:31.125
HUMAN REMAINS, THAT YOU HAVE

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:32.693
AUTHORITY TO REPATRIATE. NOW, WE

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.829
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE AUTHORITY

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:36.730
OF THOSE THAT ACTUALLY ARE USING

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:38.699
IT AS A REPOSITORY CENTER THERE.

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.367
RIGHT. THAT'S OUR GOAL, MR.

01:35:40.434 --> 01:35:42.970

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:45.306

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.607
WE TRULY ARE. YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:48.409
QUARTERLY UPDATES MOVING

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:50.277
FORWARD. IF WE COULD BE PRIVY TO

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:51.979
SOME OF THAT OUTSIDE OF THE

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:54.081
STRUCTURE, IF THAT WOULD BE GOOD

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:55.983
PURVIEW TO KEEP US UPDATED. AND

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:58.452
THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES, WE DO

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:00.955
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:03.023
BARRIERS, BARRIERS THAT NEED TO

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:04.859
BE ADDRESSED. CALIFORNIA INDIAN

01:36:04.925 --> 01:36:05.993
PEOPLE, CALIFORNIA INDIAN

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.795
TRIBES, WAY BEFORE THE STATE

01:36:07.862 --> 01:36:08.996
BECAME A STATE. SOME OF THOSE

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:10.598
REMAINS ARE IN THE ARCHIVES OF

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:12.166
THE UCS AND NOT ONLY UCS, CAL

01:36:12.233 --> 01:36:13.767
STATES, AND EVEN COMMUNITY

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:14.835
COLLEGES. IT'S TIME THAT WE GET

01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:16.537
THOSE REMAINS BACK TO THE

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:18.105
RIGHTFUL PEOPLE. BUT WE HAVE

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:19.907
BEEN IN DIALOG. I WANT TO MAKE

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:20.941
SURE THAT WE'RE PAINTING THAT

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:22.743
PICTURE. WE HAVE BEEN IN DIALOG

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:23.944
WITH THOSE PRESENTERS THAT ARE

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.980
HERE THAT ARE TRYING TO MOVE

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:26.881
FORWARD. WE'RE JUST GRAPPLING

01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:29.116
WITH THE IDEA OF HOW DO WE

01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:30.518
CREATE AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS

01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:33.287

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:39.360
PEOPLE GO OUT EDUCATED IN THE

01:36:39.426 --> 01:36:41.262
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE ARE

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:43.164
PILLARS OF THE UC SYSTEM. HOW DO

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:45.933
WE GET REPATRIATION UP TO THAT

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.768
STATUS, UP TO THAT LEVEL, TO

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:50.337
ENSURE THAT AFTER 2028, WE'RE

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:52.506
NOT SITTING HERE AGAIN WITH ALL

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:53.974
THE REMAINS IN THE ARCHIVES THAT

01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:55.075
ARE THERE. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.877
REALLY HEADED TO, AND WE ARE

01:36:56.944 --> 01:36:58.512

01:37:01.715 --> 01:37:03.584
LIKE TO SEE IT DONE SOONER. WE

PROBABLY WANT TO GET PROGRESS

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:06.954
REPORTS TO IT, AND WE'RE LOOKING

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:08.689
AT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE IN

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:10.558
STATUTE, WHETHER IT SHOULD BE IN

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:13.327
A POLICY THAT SYSTEM WIDE. THOSE

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:15.229

ESPECIALLY WITH OUR WITH OUR

01:39:14.682 --> 01:39:19.620
ANCESTORS. OUR ANCESTRAL REMAINS

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:21.488

WITHOUT CONSENT. OKAY. NOW, THE

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:28.862

HAVE ISSUE WITH IS, OKAY, THEY

01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:33.367
WERE TAKEN WITHOUT CONSENT. HOW

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:35.936
CAN THEY BE GIVEN BACK WITHOUT

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:37.705
CONSENT? YOU KNOW, THE TRIBES

01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:39.940
HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:41.675
GET WHAT THEY NEED, NOT JUST AN

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.210
ISSUE, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IN

01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:45.846
EVERY ISSUE THAT IT SEEMS TO THE

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:47.948
ISSUE SEEM TO BE IGNORED WHEN IT

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.616
COMES TO OUR TO OUR ISSUES. YOU

01:39:49.683 --> 01:39:51.452
KNOW, WE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:53.253
IMPORTANT FOR US, BECAUSE THIS

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.356
IS A STEP, THE FIRST STEP IN

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:57.925
HEALING FOR OUR TRIBES. AND I

01:39:57.991 --> 01:40:00.260
HEARD THE I HEAR THE COMMENT

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:01.495
THAT THAT TRIBES ARE BUSY. THEY

01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:04.031
DON'T HAVE TIME. WELL, LAST

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:07.935
NIGHT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR US.

01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:10.471
THERE'S THERE IS NO EXCUSE. AND

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.706
JUST TO JUST TO BE MINDFUL FROM

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.441
OUR EXPERIENCE AS TRIBAL

01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:17.378
LEADERS, IF YOU GIVE US A DATE

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:18.746
OF 2028 AND GUESS WHAT? WE'RE

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:20.948
GOING TO HOLD YOU TO THOSE DATES

01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:22.383
BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WE

01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:26.019
HAVE TO ANSWER TO AND THE

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:29.490
APOLOGIES. YOU KNOW, WE WE'VE

01:40:29.556 --> 01:40:32.526
HEARD THEM AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:35.662
TIMES. I THINK THE, THE ONLY

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:36.997
APOLOGY THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN IS

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:39.566
THE TRANSPARENCY AND THE TRUTH

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:41.335
THAT'S GIVEN TO OUR TRIBAL

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:45.339
PEOPLE. IT'S THIS IS NOT A WAY

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:46.507
TO HONOR OUR PEOPLE ON OUR

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:49.777
ANCESTORS. HEARING THE TESTIMONY

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:50.911
TODAY FROM THE AUDIENCE, THIS IS

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:54.047
THE THIRD AUDIT. AND MY CONCERN

01:40:54.114 --> 01:40:56.216
IS THAT SHOULD THE FOURTH AUDIT

01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:58.719
COME AND WE'RE STILL IN THE SAME

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:01.955
PLACE, WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:04.525
AND THAT'S A QUESTION THAT IT'S

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:06.727
UP IN THE AIR. YOU KNOW, NOBODY

01:41:06.794 --> 01:41:09.163
CAN GIVE A CLEAR ANSWER HERE

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:11.698
TODAY WITHOUT THE SPECIFIC NOT

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.200
NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE THE

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:14.868
SPECIFICS OF WHAT WAS ASKED

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:16.370
TODAY. AND THAT IS VERY

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:18.138
CONCERNING FOR US AS TRIBAL

01:41:18.205 --> 01:41:20.307
PEOPLE, BECAUSE WE'RE VERY

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:22.543
TRANSPARENT IN WHAT WE DO WITH

01:41:22.609 --> 01:41:24.211
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WITH OUR

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:25.679
PEOPLE, BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:27.514
WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:28.982
BUSINESS, TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:41:29.049 --> 01:41:31.819
THOSE ANSWERS HERE TODAY WILL

01:41:31.885 --> 01:41:34.288
MAKE OUR LIVES A LOT EASIER WHEN

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:38.258
IT COMES TO THE HEALING PROCESS.

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:39.760
ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT THE

01:41:39.827 --> 01:41:42.296
PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING THE

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:45.532
YOUTH, THE YOUTH ARE WATCHING

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:47.134
THE STORIES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:49.803
FROM US MANY, MANY YEARS AGO.

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.271
YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T GET THOSE

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:54.875
BACK, BUT WE CAN. WHAT WE CAN DO

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:55.576
IS THE STORIES THAT ARE BEING

01:41:55.642 --> 01:41:57.377
GIVEN TODAY WITH THE PASSION AND

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.947
THE AND THE WHEREWITHAL TO SIT

01:42:00.013 --> 01:42:01.748
HERE TODAY BEFORE YOU AND HAVE

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:04.251
THIS DISCUSSION ONCE AGAIN AND

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:05.686
TO AND WE APPRECIATE THE

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.187
HEARINGS THAT COME TO BRING IT

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:09.323
TO BRING THIS TO LIGHT. AND THE

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:10.691
THING IS THAT THE ISSUES THAT

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:15.362
WITH WITH THE UC SYSTEM, IN

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:16.830
ESSENCE, THEY JUST DON'T MAKE IT

01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:18.198
A PRIORITY. AND THAT'S, THAT'S

01:42:18.265 --> 01:42:19.333
JUST, THAT'S THAT'S ME SPEAKING

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:22.135
FROM THE HEART BECAUSE, YOU

01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:25.839
KNOW, THE EXPERTS ARE OUR

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:28.475
TRIBES. WE ARE THE EXPERTS WHEN

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:31.278
WE GO IN, WHEN WE GO AND SEE THE

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:33.380

ANCESTRAL THAT REMAINS OR THE

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:50.297

HAVE IT DOCUMENTED IN ALL THEIR

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:56.370
PAPERWORK. WHEN I TESTIFIED IN

2019. I BELIEVE IT WAS A UC

01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:03.277
BERKELEY. WHEN I TESTIFIED, THEY

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:07.247
SAID THAT THEY FOUND REMAINS 12

01:43:07.314 --> 01:43:08.615

01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:16.189
THAT IT'S NOT THAT'S OUR

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:17.724
ANCESTRAL REMAINS, AND WE KNOW

01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:19.993

BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO

01:46:22.175 --> 01:46:25.345
RECOGNIZE THESE TRIBES AND THAT

01:46:25.412 --> 01:46:26.713
THEY ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.616

THIS SELECT AUDIT COMMITTEE WILL

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:35.555
BE ON THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR

01:46:35.622 --> 01:46:38.191
FEDERALLY FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED

01:46:38.258 --> 01:46:40.560

FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES. IN

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.709
FACT, FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED

01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:58.011
UNRECOGNIZED TRIBES REPRESENT A

01:46:58.078 --> 01:46:59.112
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:01.615
STATE. NATIVE AMERICAN

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:03.717
POPULATION AND FACE UNIQUE

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.152
CHALLENGES AS FEDERALLY

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:07.320
RECOGNIZED TRIBES DO NOT HAVE,

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:10.857
SUCH AS THE COMPLEX HISTORY,

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:13.393
WITH SOME CURRENTLY UNRECOGNIZED

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.929
TRIBES HAVE BEEN TERMINATED FROM

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:18.098
FEDERAL RECOGNITION IN THE

01:47:18.165 --> 01:47:20.267
1950S, WHILE OTHERS HAVE NEVER

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:23.403
RECEIVED RECOGNITION. I. MY

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:25.572
QUESTION IS, GIVEN THE PAST AND

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.841
CURRENT EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT

01:47:27.908 --> 01:47:30.744
NAGPRA AND NAGPRA, CAN UC

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.946
CAMPUSES LIST OUT THE FEDERALLY

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:34.381
RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN THEIR

01:47:34.447 --> 01:47:35.782
LOCALITIES AND THEIR

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:37.851
COMMUNICATION, AND ESTABLISH

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:41.922
RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE TRIBES?

01:47:41.988 --> 01:47:44.791
ALSO, CAMPUSES MUST NOW REVISE

01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:47.294
THEIR THEIR NAGPRA MANDATES TO

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.129
APPROACH FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:50.931
TRIBES IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:53.066
THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:55.268
UNRECOGNIZED TRIBES, THE CAL

01:47:55.335 --> 01:47:57.871
NAGPRA REQUIRES THAT CAMPUSES TO

01:47:57.938 --> 01:47:59.573
INFORM THESE TRIBES OF THE

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.675
BURIAL REMAINS AND RELATED

01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:03.810
CULTURAL OBJECTS THEY POSSESS,

01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:06.713
AND IN THE PROCESS TO DETERMINE

01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.715
WHETHER A PARTICULAR TRIBE MIGHT

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:11.818
OR MIGHT NOT BE AFFILIATED WITH

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:13.620
PARTICULAR BURIAL REMAINS AND

01:48:13.687 --> 01:48:16.423
OBJECTS, IT IS FOR THE CAMPUSES

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:17.958
TO INITIATE COMMUNICATIONS

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.759
AROUND THIS PROCESS TO MAKE

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:22.529
FIRST CALLS, SEND OUT FIRST

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:24.397
INVITATIONS TO CONSULTATION

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:25.799
MEETINGS, NOT THE OTHER WAY

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:27.634
AROUND. ACCORDING TO THIS AUDIT,

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:28.935
TOO MANY TRIBES ARE COMPLAINING

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:31.204
THAT THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN

01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:33.106
CONTACTED AND HAVE NO IDEA THAT

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:34.875
THERE MIGHT BE CULTURAL

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:37.811
ARTIFACTS AND POSSIBLE BONES OF

01:48:37.878 --> 01:48:40.247
THEIR ANCESTORS LYING AROUND IN

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:43.083
SOME UC UNIVERSITY BASEMENT, OR

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:45.552
EVEN MORE SUSPECT STORAGE

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:47.087
ENVIRONMENTS. HOW WILL THE

01:48:47.153 --> 01:48:49.389
CAMPUSES RESPOND TO THIS FAILURE

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:55.295
IN COMMUNICATION? IN KEEPING

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:57.464
WITH NEW FEDERAL GUIDELINES? IN

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:58.465
ATTEMPTING TO MEET THE

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.667
CHALLENGES POSED BY THE NEW

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:02.469
RESTRICTIVE CAL NIAGARA

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:04.337
GUIDELINES WHEN IT COMES TO

01:49:04.404 --> 01:49:07.107
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES,

01:49:07.173 --> 01:49:09.309
CAMPUSES ARE NOW ENCOURAGING

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:11.011
THESE TRIBES TO PARTNER WITH

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:12.612
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES TO

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:16.016
SUBMIT JOINT REPATRIATION

01:49:16.082 --> 01:49:18.685
REQUESTS, WHICH IS EASIER SAID

01:49:18.752 --> 01:49:22.188
THAN DONE. AND IT SHOWS A

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:24.457
CERTAIN LACK OF AWARENESS. I'M

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:26.626
NOT SAYING IT CAN'T BE DONE, BUT

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:29.362
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF

01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:30.897
GROUNDWORK. THERE HAS BEEN FOR A

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:33.033
VERY LONG TIME, A LEVEL OF

01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:34.834
CONTRADICTION, SUSPICION AND

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:36.603
RESOURCE COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:39.539
AND THE CULTURAL AND POLITICAL

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:43.043
LANDSCAPE THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA,

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:45.612
INDIAN COUNTRY. THIS HAS BEEN

01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:47.113
EXPERIENCED IN VARIOUS WAYS BY

01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:49.683
MANY FEDERAL AND UNRECOGNIZED

01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:51.351
TRIBES. AND FOR ONE INSTANCE

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.586
NOTED IN THE AUDIT ON PAGE 48,

01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:55.522
IT ILLUSTRATES THIS CLEARLY, AND

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:59.292
I BELIEVE IT MIGHT BE BROADLY

01:49:59.359 --> 01:50:01.428
REPRESENTATIVE. ANOTHER QUESTION

01:50:01.494 --> 01:50:04.331
IS, IN THE CASE OF THE CAMPUSES

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:06.166
RECEIVING A JOINT REPARATION

01:50:06.232 --> 01:50:08.301
REQUEST FROM PARTNERING

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:09.769
RECOGNIZED AND UNRECOGNIZED

01:50:09.836 --> 01:50:11.237
TRIBES, CONSIDERING THE

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:13.707
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS AND

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:15.275
RELATIONAL STUMBLING BLOCK

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:16.943
BLOCKS MENTIONED BY BOTH THE

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:19.980
AUDIT AND IN MY PERSONAL

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.548
EXPERIENCE, WHAT WILL THE YOUR

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:24.551
THE CAMPUSES APPROACH BE THROUGH

01:50:24.617 --> 01:50:26.353
MEDIATION AND POSSIBLE

01:50:26.419 --> 01:50:28.121
INTERVENTIONS TO ENSURE A

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:31.024
SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO THE

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:32.625
REPATRIATION PROCESS FOR

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:35.028
PARTNERING TRIBES? IN CLOSING

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:36.396
REMARKS, IT'S BEEN HONORED TO BE

01:50:36.463 --> 01:50:38.264
INVITED TO SIT HERE WITH THE

01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:07.454
SEATED, BUT THE OTHER THREE. I'D

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:11.057

WE'LL ALLOW IT. YOU CAN SIT IN

YEAH. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:33.580
MEMBER. SO I'M NOT HERE TO TALK

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:35.982
DOWN AT YOU. I WANT YOU TO SEE

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:42.722
MY HEART. I WANT TO SHARE. AN

01:52:42.789 --> 01:52:43.723
EXPERIENCE THAT I WENT THROUGH

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:46.726
ABOUT A MONTH AGO. IT WAS RIGHT

01:52:46.793 --> 01:52:50.063
BEFORE OUR CEREMONY. I WENT TO

01:52:50.130 --> 01:52:55.268
BED. AND I WOKE UP SO TIRED.

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:57.537
EVEN MORE TIRED THAN WHEN I WENT

01:52:57.604 --> 01:52:59.572
TO SLEEP. BECAUSE I NEVER GOT

01:52:59.639 --> 01:53:02.142
REST THAT NIGHT. AS SOON AS I

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:05.311
FELL ASLEEP, I BEGAN THIS

01:53:05.378 --> 01:53:09.816
JOURNEY. AND I TRAVELED. AND

01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:11.618
WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS THIS

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:14.554
BEAUTIFUL RIVER. I COULD SEE MY

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:17.757
GREAT AUNTIE ACROSS THE WATER.

01:53:17.824 --> 01:53:20.326
SHE HOLLERED, SISTER, HERE COMES

01:53:20.393 --> 01:53:26.699
YOUR BOY! AND I SEEN MY GRANDMA.

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:28.902
AND I CROSSED THAT WATER. NEVER

01:53:28.968 --> 01:53:31.037
ONCE IN MY DREAM HAS I EVER WENT

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:33.573
TO THAT SIDE. SO THAT'S WHY I

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.074
KNOW EACH DAY THAT I SHARE ON

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:37.977
THIS SIDE, I'M GETTING CLOSER TO

01:53:38.044 --> 01:53:39.312
GO TO THAT SIDE, BECAUSE I'VE

01:53:39.379 --> 01:53:41.080
NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO GO ON THAT

01:53:41.147 --> 01:53:43.283
SIDE. MY PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS CAME

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:45.485
OVER HERE TO VISIT ME. I'VE

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:47.954
NEVER WENT OVER THERE TO VISIT,

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:50.156
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER

01:53:50.223 --> 01:53:55.161
I HAVE HERE, BUT I KNOW I HAVE

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:58.031
CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS. AND AS I

01:53:58.097 --> 01:54:01.634
WENT OVER THERE, I SEEN THE WAY

01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:04.437
IT WAS. IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND I

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:08.808
CANNOT WAIT TO GET THERE. BUT

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:10.443
OVER HERE, TO THE LEFT, THERE

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:13.580
WAS A BUNCH OF DARK SHADOWS, AND

01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:15.782
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT UNTIL

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:19.586
YOU WERE SPEAKING. THOSE DARK

01:54:19.652 --> 01:54:23.756
SHADOWS ARE OUR ANCESTORS THAT

01:54:23.823 --> 01:54:27.627
ARE STUCK ON THESE SHELVES. THEY

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:30.129
NEED TO GO BACK TO THAT SIDE, TO

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:33.566
THAT VILLAGE. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:38.004
I WAS SITTING THERE AND MY AUNT.

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:40.907
WAS WORKING ON THESE CLOTHES. I

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:42.041
WAS LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:46.346
AUNT Þ? SHE SAID, MY HUSBAND.

01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:47.680
SHE SAID, YOUR UNCLE, HE'S

01:54:47.747 --> 01:54:50.516
ALMOST HERE. SHE SAID, I HEAR

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:52.085
HIM GETTING CLOSER. AND MY

01:54:52.151 --> 01:54:55.622
UNCLE, HER HUSBAND OF 70 YEARS,

01:54:55.688 --> 01:54:58.091
AS SHE DIED ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO,

01:54:58.157 --> 01:54:59.792
ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO HE PASSED

01:54:59.859 --> 01:55:02.262
AWAY. AND SO SHE SAID, I'M

01:55:02.328 --> 01:55:04.264
PREPARING HIS CLOTHES BECAUSE

01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:05.898
WHEN HE GETS OVER HERE, HE CAN'T

01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:08.201
BE HAVING NOTHING FROM THE

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:11.170
ALBANY. THAT'S YOU VISITORS. SO

01:55:11.237 --> 01:55:13.106
HE HAD TO LEAVE HIS STUFF ON

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:14.807
THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER ONCE HE

01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:16.976
GETS THERE. AND SO WHEN SHE SAID

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:18.978
THAT, I TRIED TO LOOK DOWN TO

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:20.046
SEE WHAT I WAS WEARING. I

01:55:20.113 --> 01:55:21.514
COULDN'T SEE WHAT I WAS WEARING.

01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:23.349
BUT AS I LOOKED BACK AND I

01:55:23.416 --> 01:55:25.184
LOOKED ACROSS THAT RIVER, I

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:26.552
COULD SEE MY WHITE MAN CLOTHES

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:28.921
OVER THERE. AND SO I DON'T KNOW

01:55:28.988 --> 01:55:31.324
WHAT I WAS WEARING. MAYBE I WAS

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:35.161
JUST THERE IN MY BIRTHDAY SUIT,

01:55:35.228 --> 01:55:36.562
BECAUSE MAYBE THEY KNEW IT

01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:39.532
WASN'T MY TIME. SO NOBODY WAS

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:43.236
PREPARING MY CLOTHES. AND MY

01:55:43.303 --> 01:55:44.137
GRANDMA SAID, OH, I'M SO PROUD

01:55:44.203 --> 01:55:46.739
OF YOU ALL, WHAT YOU HAVE DONE

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:49.642
FOR THE PEOPLE, SHE SAID. AND

01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:51.711
THEN MY ONE UNCLE WAS OVER ON

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:54.681
THE RIGHT, AND HE LOOKED UPSET

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.015
AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON,

01:55:56.082 --> 01:55:58.584
UNCLE? OH, HE SAID, I'M WAITING

01:55:58.651 --> 01:56:00.820
FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. IT'S A FEW

01:56:00.887 --> 01:56:01.788
YEARS BEFORE SHE COMES, BUT I'M

01:56:01.854 --> 01:56:04.157
GOING TO SIT HERE AND WAIT

01:56:04.223 --> 01:56:05.858
BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN DOING WRONG

01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:08.628
TO OUR PEOPLE. SHE'S FORGOTTEN

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:11.898
WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A HEART FOR

01:56:11.964 --> 01:56:14.834
THE PEOPLE. SHE HAS BECOME AN

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:17.737
ALBANY. SHE HAS FORGOTTEN OUR

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:19.439
WAYS. AND SO BEFORE SHE'S

01:56:19.505 --> 01:56:21.674
ALLOWED OVER HERE TO BE WITH THE

01:56:21.741 --> 01:56:24.877
VILLAGE, I'VE GOT TO SET HER

01:56:24.944 --> 01:56:26.012
STRAIGHT. I'VE GOT TO CORRECT

01:56:26.079 --> 01:56:28.114
HER, HE SAID. AND I WANT TO MAKE

01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:31.017
SURE I'M READY FOR THAT. AND

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:33.619
THEN I WAS INTRODUCED TO MY

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.488
GREAT GRANDMOTHER. I'VE NEVER

01:56:35.555 --> 01:56:38.725
SEEN HER AND MY GREAT GREATS AND

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:42.128
ON AND ON, ALL THE WAY BACK IN

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:44.364
DIFFERENT ONES CAME AT ME AND

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:47.433
THEY SPOKE TO ME AND THEY SAID,

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:50.536
WHEN YOU GO BACK OVER THERE,

01:56:50.603 --> 01:56:53.773
GIVE A MESSAGE TO THIS PERSON.

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.909
AND THEY GAVE ME A WORD. I

01:56:56.976 --> 01:57:00.646
CALLED UP THAT RELATIVE AND

01:57:00.713 --> 01:57:02.248
SAID, I HAD THIS THING LAST

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:05.718
NIGHT HAPPENED TO ME, BUT THIS

01:57:05.785 --> 01:57:08.488
PERSON BY THE NAME OF THIS

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:11.023
CAPTAIN YELLOW JACKET, WHO'S A

01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:14.193
MIWOK INDIAN, GAVE ME THIS WORD

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:18.331
TO TELL YOU. MY RELATIVES

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:20.800
STARTED CRYING. OH, SO MY GREAT

01:57:20.867 --> 01:57:23.336
GRANDPA USED TO CALL ME. THAT

01:57:23.403 --> 01:57:26.806
WAS MY NAME. I DON'T HAVE THAT

01:57:26.873 --> 01:57:28.307
PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. THESE PEOPLE

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:31.511
WERE GONE BEFORE I WAS EVEN

01:57:31.577 --> 01:57:37.984
ALIVE. AND SO. I WONDER, WILL I

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:40.052
GET TO SEE THE RETURN OF MY

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:41.621
PEOPLE BEFORE I GO OVER THERE?

01:57:41.687 --> 01:57:43.589
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ACCEPTED. I

01:57:43.656 --> 01:57:47.560
DON'T WANT TO SEE THOSE SHADOWS.

01:57:47.627 --> 01:57:50.997
AND I NEED YOU GUYS TO HEAR ME.

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:53.766
AND LIKE YOU SAID, HUMAN

01:57:53.833 --> 01:57:56.469
REMAINS. BY 2028, ALL THOSE

01:57:56.536 --> 01:57:59.539
THINGS ARE HUMAN REMAINS.

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:02.041
EVERYTHING THAT OUR PEOPLE HAS

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:04.977
TOUCHED, WE BREATHED LIFE INTO

01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:07.847
THEIR ORNAMENTATION, THEIR

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:11.451
TOOLS. THEY ALL HAVE A SPIRIT.

01:58:11.517 --> 01:58:14.353
EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED. NOT

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:17.590
JUST THIS FLESH AND BONE.

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:19.692
EVERYTHING. EVERY ROCK WE'VE

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:21.928
TOUCHED. THAT'S WHY MY WIFE'S

01:58:21.994 --> 01:58:25.198
PEOPLE, WHEN WE'RE AT THE

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:29.469
FUNERALS. THERE'S WOMEN THAT

01:58:29.535 --> 01:58:32.171
SPRINKLE WATER BEHIND THAT BODY

01:58:32.238 --> 01:58:34.173
AS IT'S BEING TRANSPORTED TO

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:35.942
MAKE SURE THERE'S SMOOTH

01:58:36.008 --> 01:58:38.177
TRANSITION AND EVERYTHING THAT

01:58:38.244 --> 01:58:41.714
IS PUT IN THAT GRAVE IS PART OF

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:43.082
THEM. YOU NEED THAT WHEN YOU GO

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:46.052
ON THAT SIDE. AND SO TO HEAR

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:49.288
THERE MAY BE A SEPARATION

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:51.791
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A HUMAN REMAIN,

01:58:51.858 --> 01:58:53.593
OUR PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO GET A

01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:56.195
REST. YOU MUST REPATRIATE ALL

01:58:56.262 --> 01:58:58.598
THOSE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

01:58:58.664 --> 01:59:01.701
THOUSANDS OF THINGS RIGHT ALONG

01:59:01.767 --> 01:59:05.071
WITH THOSE HUMAN REMAINS,

01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:07.406
BECAUSE THAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM

01:59:07.473 --> 01:59:10.510
BY THEIR FAMILY. WHEN I BURY MY

01:59:10.576 --> 01:59:13.779
PEOPLE, WE PUT WATER IN THERE

01:59:13.846 --> 01:59:15.548
BECAUSE THEY THIRST WHEN THEY'RE

01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:16.949
TRAVELING. IT TAKES THEM A YEAR

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:19.952
TO GET OVER TO THAT SIDE. WE PUT

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:21.787
A CORNMEAL IN THERE WITH THEM

01:59:21.854 --> 01:59:23.189
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY

01:59:23.256 --> 01:59:25.658
USED IN THIS LIFE THEY'RE GOING

01:59:25.725 --> 01:59:29.228
TO NEED OVER THERE. AND SO THERE

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:32.131
CAN'T BE A SEPARATION FROM THE

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:34.634
REMAINS AND THEIR ARTIFACTS,

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:38.938
THEIR ITEMS. IT'S ALL CONNECTED,

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:42.041
BECAUSE I WOULD HOPE WHEN YOU

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:45.278
BURIED YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND THAT

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:47.113
RING THAT WAS ON HER FINGER, IF

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:50.483
SHE WAS TO BE ON EARTH AND YOU

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:53.319
ONLY GOT HER BONES BACK. BUT

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:55.488
THAT WEDDING RING THAT SHE

01:59:55.555 --> 01:59:58.424
CHERISHED SO MUCH THAT SHE

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:02.361
WANTED WITH HER STAYS ON A

02:00:02.428 --> 02:00:03.262
SHELF, DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING

02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:07.333
TO REST? NO. SHE ONCE SAT BACK

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:14.206
ON HER FINGER TO. AND SO WE HAVE

02:00:14.273 --> 02:00:16.309
TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. WE'VE

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:18.811
GOT TO RESEND THEM BACK ON THEIR

02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:21.347
JOURNEY WITH EVERYTHING THAT

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:22.214
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY PLACED

02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:26.152
WITH. AND I ASK YOU GUYS TO

02:00:26.218 --> 02:00:30.056
PLEASE DO THAT. I APPRECIATE THE

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:33.793
2028, BUT WE'VE GOT TO SEND

02:00:33.859 --> 02:00:35.094
THOSE OTHER ARTIFACTS BACK WITH

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:39.865
THEM. IF WE ARE TRULY GOING TO

02:00:39.932 --> 02:00:43.769
LET THEM REST. AND SO I WOKE UP

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:46.973
THAT MORNING AND MY WIFE WAS

02:00:47.039 --> 02:00:49.976
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE

02:00:50.042 --> 02:00:52.011
DOING IN YOUR SLEEP, SHE SAID.

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:53.779
YOU WERE TALKING YOUR LANGUAGE.

02:00:53.846 --> 02:00:55.648
SHE SAID STUFF I AIN'T NEVER

02:00:55.715 --> 02:00:57.516
HEARD YOU SAY, SHE SAID. AND OH,

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:59.285
YOU WERE JUST RESTLESS. AND THEN

02:00:59.352 --> 02:01:01.220
THERE WERE TIMES YOU WOULD

02:01:01.287 --> 02:01:05.024
LAUGH, SHE SAID. AND I WAS LIKE,

02:01:05.091 --> 02:01:09.595
WHAT'S HE DOING? AND BEFORE I

02:01:09.662 --> 02:01:13.232
WOKE UP, ALL MY ELDERS GATHERED

02:01:13.299 --> 02:01:16.769
AND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU

02:01:16.836 --> 02:01:18.638
GUYS HAVE A HARD JOB AHEAD OF

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:22.208
YOU, BUT WE KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE.

02:01:22.274 --> 02:01:24.043
AND SO NOW SETTING BACK THERE

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:26.345
DURING THIS HEARING, I REALIZED

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:29.081
WHAT THOSE SHADOWS WERE BECAUSE

02:01:29.148 --> 02:01:31.851
AS YOU WERE SPEAKING, I SEEN MY

02:01:31.917 --> 02:01:35.254
DREAM AGAIN. AND I SEEN THOSE

02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:38.057
SHADOWS GET A LITTLE BIT OF

02:01:38.124 --> 02:01:41.227
COLOR. AND SO I UNDERSTAND NOW

02:01:41.293 --> 02:01:42.361
THAT THEY WERE NOT JUST A

02:01:42.428 --> 02:01:44.864
SHADOW. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT

02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:49.535
WERE INTERRUPTED IN THEIR REST.

02:01:49.602 --> 02:01:52.038
AND THEY'VE GOT TO GET BACK

02:01:52.104 --> 02:01:54.407
BECAUSE THERE'S A VOID IN THAT

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:55.675
VILLAGE ON THAT SIDE OF THE

02:01:55.741 --> 02:01:59.512
WORLD. AND SO MY GRANDPA ALWAYS

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:01.414
SAID, WE'VE GOT A DOCTOR, YOUR

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.916
MINDS. SO I HOPE TODAY, EVEN

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:07.153
THOUGH I DO NOT HAVE A DEGREE OR

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:08.688
ANYTHING, I, AS THE INDIAN

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:11.223
EXPERT FROM MY LAND, FROM MY

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:15.895
COUNTRY, HAS DOCTORED YOUR MIND.

02:02:15.961 --> 02:02:20.533
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:22.168
YOUR TESTIMONY. YOU CAN RETURN

02:02:22.234 --> 02:02:25.237
BACK AND THANK YOU SO MUCH TO

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:28.774
THE UK'S FOR BEING ABLE TO COME

02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:30.509
UP AND SIT UP IN FRONT. BECAUSE

02:02:30.576 --> 02:02:33.212
NOW WE MOVE TO OUR NEXT

02:02:33.279 --> 02:02:35.481

02:02:45.458 --> 02:02:48.527
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS, ASSEMBLY

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:52.531

VALENTIN LOPEZ AND I'M THE CHAIR

OF THE MUTSUN TRIBAL BAND. OUR

02:03:01.073 --> 02:03:03.409
TRADITIONAL TERRITORIES ARE

02:03:03.476 --> 02:03:08.481
SOUTH OF SANTA CRUZ DOWN TO THE

02:03:08.547 --> 02:03:11.784
ELKHORN SLOUGH AND INLAND TO

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:15.221
GILROY, HOLLISTER, MORGAN HILL,

02:03:15.287 --> 02:03:16.822
SOUTH TO PINNACLES, AND THEN TO

02:03:16.889 --> 02:03:19.291
THE RIDGELINE OF THE DIABLO

02:03:19.358 --> 02:03:23.662
RANGE. I FIRST ATTEMPTED

02:03:23.729 --> 02:03:25.664
REPATRIATION WITH èC TRIBE.

02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:27.800
FIRST ATTEMPTED REPATRIATION

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:34.607
WITH UC BERKELEY IN 2009. AND WE

02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:35.341
WORKED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE THAT

02:03:35.407 --> 02:03:39.011
TIME, AND WE'VE YET TO HAVE ANY

02:03:39.078 --> 02:03:41.413
REMAINS RETURNED OR HAVE ANY

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.049
HOPE OF HAVING REMAINS RETURNED.

02:03:44.116 --> 02:03:45.684
I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:48.387
THAT HISTORY. IN THE OLD DAYS, I

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:54.193
WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE. A

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:57.963
NATIVE AMERICAN ADVISOR TO UCOP

02:03:58.030 --> 02:04:03.102
ON ISSUES RELATED TO. NAGPRA.

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:05.337
AND I CAN TELL YOU THOSE EARLY

02:04:05.404 --> 02:04:07.173
DAYS WERE VERY HARD, VERY

02:04:07.239 --> 02:04:10.643
DIFFICULT. WHEN I FIRST JOINED

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:12.478
THERE, I HAD PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:14.346
TELLING ME I DON'T BELONG THERE,

02:04:14.413 --> 02:04:16.081
TALKING ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF HOW

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:18.184
THE REMAINS ARE THEIR PROPERTY,

02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:21.954
HOW THEY OWN THEM, HOW THEY CAN

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:23.789
DO WHAT THEY WANT WITH THEM. AND

02:04:23.856 --> 02:04:26.192
THEY TALKED ABOUT AND BECAUSE WE

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:26.826
WERE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED, THEY

02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:29.395
DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH US. I

02:04:29.461 --> 02:04:30.830
LISTENED TO A LOT OF THOSE

02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:34.166
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS ON THAT

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:37.436
COMMITTEE, BUT I STAYED AND I

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:42.641
CONTINUE TO FIGHT. BUT I HAVE

02:04:42.708 --> 02:04:45.978
WORKED CONTINUOUSLY WITH THEM. I

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:49.281
ALSO WORKED TO GET REPATRIATION,

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:51.016
TO ATTEMPT REPATRIATION AT UC

02:04:51.083 --> 02:04:54.453
SANTA CRUZ. SANTA CRUZ WAS WAS

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.455
MUCH MORE COOPERATIVE AND

02:04:56.522 --> 02:04:57.656
WILLING TO WORK WITH OUR TRIBE

02:04:57.723 --> 02:04:59.625
THAN BERKELEY WAS AT THAT TIME.

02:04:59.692 --> 02:05:03.362
AND THIS IS IN THE 2017 TO 2019

02:05:03.429 --> 02:05:06.565
PERIOD OF TIME. BELIEVE IT OR

02:05:06.632 --> 02:05:09.001
NOT, WE SUCCESSFULLY GOT THE

02:05:09.068 --> 02:05:10.836
REMAINS OF APPROXIMATELY 19. I

02:05:10.903 --> 02:05:12.705
BELIEVE IT WAS ANCESTORS

02:05:12.771 --> 02:05:14.907
RETURNED TO US FROM FROM UC

02:05:14.974 --> 02:05:18.344
SANTA CRUZ. WE WENT THROUGH THE

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:19.745
NATIONAL NAGPRA. WE HAD A

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:23.482
HEARING IN FAIRBANKS, ALASKA IN

02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:25.951
2019, AND WE GOT THE REMAINS

02:05:26.018 --> 02:05:27.386
RETURNED TO US AS A FEDERALLY

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:29.955
RECOGNIZED TRIBE, NOT HAVING TO

02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:32.424
WORK WITH A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:36.161
TRIBE. AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO

02:05:36.228 --> 02:05:38.530
US. WE WANTED OUR OWN IDENTITY.

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:41.333
WE WANT OUR OWN SOVEREIGNTY. WE

02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:43.135
DID NOT WANT TO WORK WITH

02:05:43.202 --> 02:05:45.004
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES,

02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:45.905
ALTHOUGH WE DID HAVE OFFERS, AND

02:05:45.971 --> 02:06:02.655
WE APPRECIATE THOSE.

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:09.061
MR. POTTER TOLD OF. A DREAM HE

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:11.463
RECENTLY HAVE. I'D LIKE TO TELL

02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:16.435
YOU OF OUR PERSPECTIVE OF OUR

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:20.839
ANCESTORS. WHEN THEY PASS, WE

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:21.941
SAY THEY PASSED THROUGH THE

02:06:22.007 --> 02:06:25.778
OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN. AND WE

02:06:25.844 --> 02:06:28.280
BELIEVE IT'S. OUR BELIEF IS THAT

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:29.682
WHEN WE, THOSE REMAINS, ARE

02:06:29.748 --> 02:06:30.849
DISTURBED, WE'RE CALLING THEIR

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:32.851
SPIRIT BACK FROM THE OTHER SIDE,

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:35.120
AND THEY CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY

02:06:35.187 --> 02:06:36.555
RETURN BACK WITH THEIR TO THE

02:06:36.622 --> 02:06:39.024
SPIRIT WORLD UNTIL THEY ARE

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.859
FULLY AND COMPLETELY REBURIED

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:45.864
WITH CEREMONY. SO THIS IS A HUGE

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:47.266
VIOLATION OF OUR SPIRITUAL

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:49.101
BELIEFS. BY NOT HAVING THE

02:06:49.168 --> 02:06:51.537
REMAINS OF OUR ANCESTORS RETURN

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:54.173
TO US FOR THAT REBURIAL. AND I

02:06:54.239 --> 02:06:55.674
YOU KNOW, AND I'VE SAID THIS

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:56.942
MANY, MANY TIMES THAT THIS IS

02:06:57.009 --> 02:07:00.412
THE GREAT THIS IS OUR NUMBER ONE

02:07:00.479 --> 02:07:01.847
PRIORITY OF OUR TRIBE. AND IT'S

02:07:01.914 --> 02:07:03.482
A HUGE VIOLATION OF OUR

02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:11.156
SPIRITUAL BELIEFS THAT WE FEEL.

02:07:11.223 --> 02:07:13.392
HELPLESS TO BE ABLE TO DO, TO DO

02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:22.601
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. UNIVERSITIES.

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:25.137
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:28.273
WHENEVER WE, YOU KNOW, ISSUE A

02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:30.175
CLAIM FOR REMAINS, THE

02:07:30.242 --> 02:07:31.710
UNIVERSITY SENDS A LETTER OUT TO

02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:35.247
ALL OTHER TRIBES WITHIN OUR

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:40.285
REGION TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY

02:07:40.352 --> 02:07:46.025
COMMENTS ON OUR CLAIM. WELL,

02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:50.996
INEVITABLY MANY TRIBES. SUBMIT

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:52.831
OPPOSITION TO OUR HAVING THE

02:07:52.898 --> 02:07:55.401
REMAINS RETURNED TO US BECAUSE

02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:56.869
THEY THEY SAY THOSE REMAINS

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:59.338
SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THEM. AND

02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:01.807
WE HAVE TRIBES WHO HAVE IN OUR

02:08:01.874 --> 02:08:03.709
TERRITORY OHLONE. THE GREATER WE

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:06.145
DON'T USE THE TERM OHLONE.

02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:09.048
OHLONE IS A TRIBE, WAS A TRIBE

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:11.784
THAT WAS AT PESCADERO, AND THE

02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:13.052
SPANISH STARTED CALLING THEM

02:08:13.118 --> 02:08:14.920
OHONE. AND THEN IT WAS APPLIED

02:08:14.987 --> 02:08:17.356
TO EVERYONE WITHIN THE GREATER

02:08:17.423 --> 02:08:18.991
TERRITORY OF OHLONE RECOGNIZED

02:08:19.058 --> 02:08:22.661
TODAY. BUT WHENEVER THEY SEND

02:08:22.728 --> 02:08:23.796
THOSE LETTERS OUT TO OTHER

02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:24.963
TRIBES, THEY SAY THEY WANT, YOU

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:27.199
KNOW, THAT THEY WANT THE REMAINS

02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:27.933
RETURNED TO THEM. AND THOSE

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.468
TRIBES CAN BE FROM SAN

02:08:29.535 --> 02:08:32.504
FRANCISCO, OAKLAND, MONTEREY. IT

02:08:32.571 --> 02:08:34.573
DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS THEY

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:36.175
SAID A CLAIM. THAT CLAIM STOPS

02:08:36.241 --> 02:08:37.176
AND THE UNIVERSITY SAYS WE CAN'T

02:08:37.242 --> 02:08:38.977
DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT UNTIL

02:08:39.044 --> 02:08:42.147
THIS, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS

02:08:42.214 --> 02:08:45.350
SETTLED, WE HAVE OFFERED. ALL

02:08:45.417 --> 02:08:48.253
THE OTHER TRIBES THAT HAVE EVER

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:50.122
SUBMITTED A LETTER OF DISPUTE.

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:51.924
WE HAVE TOLD THEM THAT LET'S

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:53.725
WORK TOGETHER. LET'S REBURY

02:08:53.792 --> 02:08:55.527
THESE TOGETHER. YOU CAN HOLD

02:08:55.594 --> 02:08:57.062
YOUR CEREMONY. WE'LL HOLD OUR

02:08:57.129 --> 02:08:57.963
CEREMONY. THE IMPORTANT THING

02:08:58.030 --> 02:09:00.165
IS, IS TO HAVE THEM REBURIED.

02:09:00.232 --> 02:09:02.000
NOT ONCE IS ANY OTHER TRIBE

02:09:02.067 --> 02:09:05.270
TAKING THEM UP FOR THIS. AND I

02:09:05.337 --> 02:09:08.173
DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THAT THAT'S

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.641
A THAT'S A HUGE ROADBLOCK FOR

02:09:09.708 --> 02:09:12.978
US. NOW, WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:14.279
WE CAN WORK WITH THE FEDERAL

02:09:14.346 --> 02:09:17.583
TRIBES TO GET THE REMAINS

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:21.520
RETURNED TO US. LAST YEAR IN

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:22.888
THIS HEARING. I SPOKE AT THIS

02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:25.390
HEARING LAST YEAR, THERE IS A

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:26.058
CHAIRWOMAN FROM ANOTHER TRIBE. I

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:29.027
WON'T MENTION THE TRIBE. AFTER

02:09:29.094 --> 02:09:30.729
SHE SPOKE AND AFTER I SPOKE, I

02:09:30.796 --> 02:09:32.564
TALKED TO HER AT THE END OF THE

02:09:32.631 --> 02:09:34.766
HEARING AND ASKED HER IF SHE'D

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:35.901
BE WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:38.270
REPATRIATION. SHE SAID YES, I

02:09:38.337 --> 02:09:40.038
CONTACTED HER. I SENT MESSAGES

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:44.143
TO HER AT LEAST 810 TIMES.

02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:47.379
EMAIL, TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH THE

02:09:47.446 --> 02:09:49.515
OFFICE AND TO HER NUMBER

02:09:49.581 --> 02:09:51.283
DIRECTLY. I DID NOT GET A

02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:53.852
RETURN. I MADE REQUESTS OF OTHER

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:54.953
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES TO

02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:57.389
WORK WITH US ON REPATRIATION,

02:09:57.456 --> 02:10:00.325
AND I GET NO RESPONSE. I HAVE

02:10:00.392 --> 02:10:01.827
BEEN TOLD BY MEMBERS OF THE

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:03.162
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES WHO

02:10:03.228 --> 02:10:05.230
SIT ON COUNCILS IS A FEDERALLY

02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:06.798
RECOGNIZED TRIBES WILL NOT WORK

02:10:06.865 --> 02:10:08.934
WITH US. THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO

02:10:09.001 --> 02:10:11.537
WITH UNRECOGNIZED TRIBES. THAT'S

02:10:11.603 --> 02:10:15.340
A HUGE BLOCK FOR US. WE HAVE HAD

02:10:15.407 --> 02:10:18.343
TWO RECOGNIZED TRIBES SAY THEY

02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:20.512
WILL WORK WITH US, BUT THEY MUST

02:10:20.579 --> 02:10:21.980
GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS THAT

02:10:22.047 --> 02:10:24.850
UC SYSTEM DOES. THEY HAVE TO

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:27.219
CONTACT ALL THE OTHER TRIBES

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:28.921
THAT ARE ON THAT LIST. THEY ASK

02:10:28.987 --> 02:10:30.923
THEM TO HAVE THEIR, YOU KNOW, IF

02:10:30.989 --> 02:10:34.092
THEY HAVE ANY, ANY, ANY SAY INTO

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:37.629
WHAT OUR OUR CLAIM IS. AND ONCE

02:10:37.696 --> 02:10:38.997
AGAIN, THEY JUMP ALL OVER THAT

02:10:39.064 --> 02:10:40.966
AND SAY, NO, THOSE ARE THEIR

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:42.067
REMAINS, AND THEY WANT THOSE

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:43.502
REMAINS RETURNED TO THEM ONLY,

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:45.170
AND THEY WILL NOT WORK WITH US.

02:10:45.237 --> 02:10:48.006
WE MADE THE SAME OFFER. AS I

02:10:48.073 --> 02:10:50.375
SAID, THIS IS A HUGE VIOLATION

02:10:50.442 --> 02:10:51.777
OF OUR SPIRITUAL BELIEF. WE WANT

02:10:51.843 --> 02:10:53.111
TO GET THEM REBURIED. WE'LL WORK

02:10:53.178 --> 02:10:55.247
WITH THE OTHER TRIBES. THE OTHER

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:58.116
TRIBES CAN OFFER US JUST ABOUT

02:10:58.183 --> 02:10:59.952
ANY TERMS, AND WE'D PROBABLY SAY

02:11:00.018 --> 02:11:02.120
YES IF WE CAN GET THOSE

02:11:02.187 --> 02:11:04.156
RETURNED, BUT YET WE GET NO

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:13.999
COUNTER-OFFER WHATSOEVER. WE

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:15.734
HAVE. WE HAD TWO TRIBES THAT

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:17.569
WORKED WITH US, AS I SAID, AND

02:11:17.636 --> 02:11:19.204
I'LL MENTION THEM AND GIVE THEM

02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:21.940
THANKS. WILTON HAS AGREED, HAS

02:11:22.007 --> 02:11:23.442
OFFERED TO WORK WITH US. BUT

02:11:23.508 --> 02:11:25.143
THEN WE HAD THAT SAME THING OF

02:11:25.210 --> 02:11:27.246
WHERE THEY SEND THE CLAIM OUT

02:11:27.312 --> 02:11:28.313
AND ALL THESE OTHER TRIBES JUMP

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:30.549
IN. AND WE HAD THE SAME THING

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:32.718
WITH THE CHUMASH, THE SANTA YNEZ

02:11:32.784 --> 02:11:33.919
CHUMASH. THEY SAID THAT THEY

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:35.554
WOULD WORK WITH US, BUT THEY HAD

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:39.291
THE SAME ISSUES THERE. I WANT TO

02:11:39.358 --> 02:11:45.998
SAY THAT. WHEN WHAT? WE HAVE

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:49.401
ASKED, SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:51.503
HAPPENED IS THAT WE ARE TOLD IN

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:54.773
ABOUT 2018 OR 2019 THAT THE

02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.074
NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE

02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:57.409
COMMISSION WAS GOING TO COME UP

02:11:57.476 --> 02:12:00.912
WITH AN ARBITRATION PROCESS TO

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:02.681
DETERMINE WHICH TRIBE THOSE

02:12:02.748 --> 02:12:05.384
REMAINS SHOULD BE REPATRIATED

02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:09.888
TO. THAT PROCESS HAS NEVER BEEN

02:12:09.955 --> 02:12:13.458
DEVELOPED, AND WE WERE TOLD FOR

02:12:13.525 --> 02:12:14.793
YEARS THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:17.329
THAT ARBITRATION PROCESS JUST A

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:18.764
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. NOW WE'RE

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:20.966
HEARING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

02:12:21.033 --> 02:12:22.701
REVISE THEIR CRITERIA FOR BEING

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:25.637
FEDERALLY UNRECOGNIZED, AND THAT

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:27.339
RIGHT THERE SHOULD ACHIEVE THE

02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:29.241
SAME THING AS, YOU KNOW, IT'S

02:12:29.308 --> 02:12:30.676
AND THE INTENT THERE WAS TO GET

02:12:30.742 --> 02:12:33.145
RID OF A LOT OF THE TRIBES THAT

02:12:33.211 --> 02:12:35.380
ARE ON THE LIST THAT ARE NOT

02:12:35.447 --> 02:12:37.482
LEGITIMATE TRIBES. AND LET'S BE

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:40.419
HONEST ON THAT, ON THAT, ON

02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:43.221
NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE LIST.

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:46.491
THERE ARE A LOT OF ILLEGITIMATE

02:12:46.558 --> 02:12:50.162
TRIBES, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S A

02:12:50.228 --> 02:12:51.596
TRIBE THERE THAT IS COMPRISED OF

02:12:51.663 --> 02:12:53.098
A MOTHER DAUGHTER ONLY, AND THAT

02:12:53.165 --> 02:12:56.301
IS A TRIBE. THERE IS A TRIBE

02:12:56.368 --> 02:13:00.572
THERE THAT THAT NEWLY FORMED.

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:02.674
THERE IS NO TRIBE PRIOR TO THAT,

02:13:02.741 --> 02:13:08.814
IN 2020 1ST JANUARY OF 2021,

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.782
THEY BECAME A TRIBE. AND NOW

02:13:10.849 --> 02:13:12.451
THEY'RE BEING RECOGNIZED AS A

02:13:12.517 --> 02:13:14.753
CONTINUOUS AND HISTORIC TRIBE OF

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:17.956
THEIR TERRITORY. BUT HOW CAN

02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:19.591
THAT POSSIBLY BE IF THEY'RE

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:21.093
CONTINUOUS AND HISTORIC? AND BY

02:13:21.159 --> 02:13:23.662
THE WAY, THAT CHAIRWOMAN WAS A

02:13:23.729 --> 02:13:25.130
MEMBER OF OUR TRIBE GOING, YOU

02:13:25.197 --> 02:13:26.498
KNOW, AND WAS ON OUR COUNCIL

02:13:26.565 --> 02:13:30.135
BACK IN 1990, IN THE 1990S AND

02:13:30.202 --> 02:13:33.638
UP UNTIL 20 2020, SHE WAS A

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:34.940
MEMBER OF OUR TRIBAL COUNCIL.

02:13:35.006 --> 02:13:37.075
AND NOW SHE DROPS SHE RESIGNS

02:13:37.142 --> 02:13:37.843
FROM OUR COUNCIL. THE NEXT

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:39.745
MONTH, SHE STARTS A NEW TRIBE

02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:42.047
AND SHE'S ON THE NATIVE AMERICAN

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:45.517
HERITAGE LIST. HOW CAN THAT BE?

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:48.453
THERE'S ALSO A PERSON THERE WHO,

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:50.922
YOU KNOW WAS WAS FRAUDULENT AND

02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:53.458
CLAIMING TO BE A TRIBE. THE

02:13:53.525 --> 02:13:54.860
FEDERAL OFFICE OF INSPECTOR

02:13:54.926 --> 02:13:56.395
GENERAL DID AN INVESTIGATION OF

02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:59.197
HER, AND THEY FOUND FRAUD ON HER

02:13:59.264 --> 02:14:01.967
PART. AND SHE'S STILL ON THE

02:14:02.033 --> 02:14:04.469
NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE LIST.

02:14:04.536 --> 02:14:08.039
HOW CAN THAT BE THEN? AS I KIND

02:14:08.106 --> 02:14:10.275
OF REFERRED TO EARLIER, THERE'S

02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:12.144
A NUMBER OF PANTALONI TRIBES WHO

02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:13.612
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:16.248
TO ANY REMAINS THAT ARE ALONE IN

02:14:16.314 --> 02:14:18.150
ANY IN, IN ANY ANYTHING

02:14:18.216 --> 02:14:21.253
RECOGNIZES THE TERRITORY. SO

02:14:21.319 --> 02:14:23.722
THIS IS JUST ATROCIOUS. THINGS

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:26.324
THAT HAPPEN TO US THAT THIS

02:14:26.391 --> 02:14:29.795
SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO, TO

02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:35.867
HAPPEN TO US. THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:14:35.934 --> 02:14:37.269
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE UC

02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:39.504
SYSTEM, THE NATIVE AMERICAN

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:40.639
HERITAGE COMMISSION AND THE

02:14:40.705 --> 02:14:42.307
NATIONAL NAGPRA. THERE'S SO MUCH

02:14:42.374 --> 02:14:44.509
CONFLICT AND DIFFERENCES THERE.

02:14:44.576 --> 02:14:45.944
THEY'RE JUST TOTALLY

02:14:46.011 --> 02:14:47.746
INCOMPATIBLE. IN ALL HONESTY,

02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:49.281
WE'RE HERE LOOKING AT THAT AUDIT

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:52.818
OF THE UC BERKELEY, I MEAN, OF

02:14:52.884 --> 02:14:56.788
THE UC SYSTEM, RATHER, AND I'VE

02:14:56.855 --> 02:14:58.356
BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM

02:14:58.423 --> 02:15:02.260
SINCE 2009, AND I'M MAD AT VERY,

02:15:02.327 --> 02:15:04.196
VERY UPSET, VERY DISAPPOINTED.

02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:06.097
BUT I DON'T BLAME THEM ENTIRELY

02:15:06.164 --> 02:15:08.667
BECAUSE I SEE ALL THOSE OTHER

02:15:08.733 --> 02:15:10.535
CONFLICTS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:11.937
THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:14.206
THEM. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO

02:15:14.272 --> 02:15:16.608
DEAL WITH ONE PROCESS, THE UC

02:15:16.675 --> 02:15:18.543
SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

02:15:18.610 --> 02:15:20.111
THE BIGGER PROBLEM HERE, THE

02:15:20.178 --> 02:15:28.820
BIGGER ISSUES HERE. GIVE ME A

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:31.756
SECOND. I THINK I'LL SEE IF I

02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:34.259
HAVE ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I

02:15:34.326 --> 02:15:38.964
YIELD BACK. AT ONE TIME WE HEARD

02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:40.932
THIS IS THIS WILL BE MY FINAL

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:43.034
POINT. THANK YOU FOR BEARING

02:15:43.101 --> 02:15:45.303
WITH ME. YOU KNOW, NOW WE YOU

02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:47.539
KNOW, THE FEDERAL UNRECOGNIZED

02:15:47.606 --> 02:15:49.374
TRIBES HAVE TO DEAL WITH FEDERAL

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:51.243
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES. BUT

02:15:51.309 --> 02:15:52.644
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANTS

02:15:52.711 --> 02:15:55.113
NOTHING TO DO WITH US. IF WE'RE

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:56.515
NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE

02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:59.050
GOVERNMENT, WHY DO THEY HAVE ANY

02:15:59.117 --> 02:16:00.018
SAY ON OUR THE REMAINS OF OUR

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:03.822
ANCESTORS? THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

02:16:03.889 --> 02:16:05.290
THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE ANOTHER

02:16:05.357 --> 02:16:07.993
HUGE CONFLICT. AND IT SHOULD NOT

02:16:08.059 --> 02:16:09.861
BE HAPPENING. YOU KNOW, IF THEY

02:16:09.928 --> 02:16:12.330
DON'T HAVE IF WE'RE NOT

02:16:12.397 --> 02:16:13.598
RECOGNIZED BY THE FEDERAL

02:16:13.665 --> 02:16:14.833
GOVERNMENT, WHY DO THEY HAVE SAY

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:19.170
ABOUT OUR ANCESTORS? AND WE WERE

02:16:19.237 --> 02:16:23.975
TOLD ONE TIME THAT THE AS A

02:16:24.042 --> 02:16:27.479
STRATEGY TO REQUEST TO REQUEST

02:16:27.546 --> 02:16:31.816
NATIONAL NAGPRA, TO JUST GIVE

02:16:31.883 --> 02:16:35.053
THE UC CLAIMS, JUST JUST GIVE

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:38.623
THE UNRECOGNIZED TRIBES UNDER

02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:42.294
UNDER NAGPRA, JUST GIVE THEM

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:44.930
GIVE IT TO THE STATE AND LET THE

02:16:44.996 --> 02:16:45.597
STATE MAKE THAT DETERMINATION.

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:46.665
IF WE'RE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED

02:16:46.731 --> 02:16:47.699
TRIBES, WE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING

02:16:47.766 --> 02:16:48.900
TO DO WITH THE FEDERAL

02:16:48.967 --> 02:16:50.569
GOVERNMENT. JUST GIVE IT TO THE

02:16:50.635 --> 02:16:51.703
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET THE

02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:53.305
STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEAL WITH

02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:55.874
IT. BUT THEN SHORTLY AFTER THAT,

02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:57.409
THAT'S WHEN THE GUIDELINES COME

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:58.977
OUT THAT SAY, WE HAVE TO WORK

02:16:59.044 --> 02:17:00.211
WITH FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED

02:17:00.278 --> 02:17:00.845
TRIBES. AND WE FEEL THAT THAT

02:17:00.912 --> 02:17:02.881
WAS KIND OF LIKE A SABOTAGE

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:04.382
ISSUE FOR US. I'LL I'LL STOP

02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:06.451

FRUSTRATION THAT HAS GONE ON FOR

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:18.970
35 YEARS. UNACCEPTABLE, IN MY

02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:21.205
OPINION. AND ONE THING THAT I

02:26:21.272 --> 02:26:22.840
WOULD LIKE THAT WE CAN ALL WALK

02:26:22.907 --> 02:26:26.177
AWAY FROM TODAY IS TO FIGURE OUT

02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:28.346
THIS CHAIN OF COMMUNICATION. ON

ONE END, WE'RE HEARING THAT THE

THAT IS NOT WHAT IS BEING

02:26:46.464 --> 02:26:49.000
PERCEIVED AND EXPERIENCED. SO MY

02:26:49.066 --> 02:26:50.268
HOPE IS THAT THE COMMITMENT FROM

02:26:50.334 --> 02:26:52.837

02:26:57.942 --> 02:26:59.177

OUTREACH TO THE TRIBES TO BE ON,

02:29:47.044 --> 02:29:48.779
ON HOW TO GET THEM INVOLVED IN

02:29:48.846 --> 02:29:50.648
THIS PROCESS OF REPATRIATION BY

02:29:50.715 --> 02:29:54.018
THE AUDITORS, IF YOU'RE AWARE OF

02:29:54.085 --> 02:29:57.988
ANYTHING? NOPE. I HAVE NO

02:29:58.055 --> 02:29:58.989

NO, IT WAS THE SAME MEETING WITH

02:30:04.528 --> 02:30:06.230
CHAIRMAN NIETO. AND I THINK THAT

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:08.332
UC BERKELEY AND OTHER UC SYSTEMS

02:30:08.399 --> 02:30:10.534
CAN TAKE A PAGE OUT OF PRESIDENT

02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:11.936
SANDOVAL'S BOOK BECAUSE HE TOOK

02:30:12.002 --> 02:30:14.705
THE INITIATIVE AND SHOWED THE

02:30:14.772 --> 02:30:16.741
RESPECT TO US AS TRIBAL LEADERS

02:30:16.807 --> 02:30:18.776
THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE OUR

02:30:18.843 --> 02:30:20.578
ANCESTORS ARE NOT POSSESSIONS,

02:30:20.644 --> 02:30:21.712
AND THEY SHOULDN'T TAKE

02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:22.780
OWNERSHIP NEITHER AND NEITHER

02:30:22.847 --> 02:30:24.915

02:30:24.982 --> 02:30:27.952
IDEA FOR ALL YOU SEE NEXUS AS

02:30:28.018 --> 02:30:30.121

02:31:57.408 --> 02:31:58.909
THAT HAVE HAPPENED, SOME OF THE

02:31:58.976 --> 02:31:59.777
BARRIERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:31:59.844 --> 02:32:01.512
THAT WE ACTUALLY OVERCOME THOSE

02:32:01.579 --> 02:32:04.248
AND ADDRESS THOSE. BUT TODAY'S

02:32:04.315 --> 02:32:07.384
AN IMPORTANT DAY BECAUSE WE ARE

02:32:07.451 --> 02:32:09.320
ONE STEP CLOSER TO GETTING TO

02:32:09.386 --> 02:32:11.222
WHERE WE NEED TO GO. AND I THINK

02:32:11.288 --> 02:32:15.793
THAT ONE WAY WE CAN HONOR THOSE

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:17.228
THOSE WHO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

02:32:17.294 --> 02:32:19.330
TODAY, THE REMAINS AND THE

02:32:19.396 --> 02:32:20.531
ANCESTRAL ANTIQUITIES THAT ARE

02:32:20.598 --> 02:32:23.234
AT STAKE, IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:24.401
THERE IS TRANSPARENCY, TO MAKE

02:32:24.468 --> 02:32:27.171
SURE THAT EVERYONE IS ACTUALLY

02:32:27.238 --> 02:32:30.007
SPEAKING FROM THE SAME SET OF

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:32.510
FACTS AND USING THE SAME

02:32:32.576 --> 02:32:34.345
EVIDENCE. AND I THINK THAT THIS

02:32:34.411 --> 02:32:35.913
HEARING HELPS US DO THAT. THESE

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:37.515
AUDITS HELP US DO THAT. AND I

02:32:37.581 --> 02:32:39.216
THINK WE ARE HERE JUST BECAUSE

02:32:39.283 --> 02:32:42.987
WE WANT TO HONOR AND RESPECT THE

02:32:43.053 --> 02:32:45.689
TRADITIONS OF OUR FIRST NATIONS,

02:32:45.756 --> 02:32:48.492
OUR NATIVE PEOPLE. AND I THINK

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:50.694
THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.

02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:52.563
ALL OF US NEED TO WORK TOGETHER

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:55.165
IN DOING THAT, AND I ASSURE YOU

02:32:55.232 --> 02:32:57.034
THAT YOU'LL HAVE MY PERSONAL

02:32:57.101 --> 02:32:58.869
COMMITMENT AND YOU'LL HAVE

02:32:58.936 --> 02:33:00.704
EVERYONE UP HERE. ALL OF MY

02:33:00.771 --> 02:33:02.139
COLLEAGUES UP HERE WOULD GIVE

02:33:02.206 --> 02:33:04.275
YOU THAT SAME COMMITMENT. SO

02:33:04.341 --> 02:33:07.478
THANK YOU AGAIN TO MR. CHAIRMAN

02:33:07.545 --> 02:33:09.313
FOR DOING THIS, AND I APPRECIATE

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:11.448
ALL YOUR WORK. WELL, THANK YOU,

02:33:11.515 --> 02:33:13.684
CHAIRMAN, FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND

02:33:13.751 --> 02:33:15.352
THOSE ON THE DAIS FOR YOUR

02:33:15.419 --> 02:33:17.588
COMMENTS TO THIS REALLY

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:18.956
IMPORTANT ISSUE TO CALIFORNIA'S

02:33:19.023 --> 02:33:21.959
FIRST PEOPLE, NATIVE HAWAIIANS

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:23.060
AND ALL THOSE REMAINS THAT STILL

02:33:23.127 --> 02:33:25.462
ARE IN THE ARCHIVES. WE DO WANT

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:27.665
TO ADDRESS A COUPLE THINGS THAT

02:33:27.731 --> 02:33:31.268
WERE MENTIONED. TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE

02:33:31.335 --> 02:33:34.605
AS BEING A CRITERIA FOR

02:33:34.672 --> 02:33:37.308
REPATRIATION, AND TO THE COMMENT

02:33:37.374 --> 02:33:39.310
FROM ONE OF THE CHAIRS SAYING

02:33:39.376 --> 02:33:41.345
THAT THAT WAS NONSENSE, BECAUSE

02:33:41.412 --> 02:33:44.582
WHEN THOSE REMAINS WERE WERE DUG

02:33:44.648 --> 02:33:47.818
UP, THERE WAS NO CONSENT GIVEN.

02:33:47.885 --> 02:33:50.621
SO MAYBE WE NEED TO START

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:54.725
LOOKING AT NOT MAKING IT HARDER

02:33:54.792 --> 02:33:57.294
THROUGH REGULATION TO

02:33:57.361 --> 02:33:58.829
REPATRIATE, BUT START TO LOOK AT

02:33:58.896 --> 02:34:00.397
IT, MAKING IT EASIER WITH THE

02:34:00.464 --> 02:34:01.565
TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE THAT'S THERE.

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:04.802
WE HAVE RAN SEVERAL BILLS TO

02:34:04.868 --> 02:34:06.604
EQUATE TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE TO THOSE

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.105
MUSEUM DIRECTORS THAT ARE IN

02:34:08.172 --> 02:34:10.140
THOSE ARCHIVES. BUT I WANTED TO

02:34:10.207 --> 02:34:11.842
BRING THAT UP BECAUSE IT TRULY

02:34:11.909 --> 02:34:14.712
IS A COMMENT THAT I THINK NEEDS

02:34:14.778 --> 02:34:19.183
TO RESONATE, THAT CONSENT NOW

02:34:19.249 --> 02:34:20.551
WITH THE CRITERIA THAT'S THEY'RE

02:34:20.618 --> 02:34:22.453
SENDING OUT NOTICES. BUT YET

02:34:22.519 --> 02:34:24.922
THOSE REMAINS DIDN'T ASK TO BE

02:34:24.989 --> 02:34:27.057
DUG UP, BUT YET THEY'VE BEEN IN

02:34:27.124 --> 02:34:29.293
STORAGE FOR MANY YEARS NOW. AND

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:32.796
SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT A PROCESS

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:35.299
THAT SPEEDS UP THAT PROCESS

02:34:35.366 --> 02:34:38.235
OURSELVES, AND IDENTIFYING

02:34:38.302 --> 02:34:39.403
BARRIERS THAT ARE OUT THERE, NOT

02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:41.105
JUST ON THE UC SIDE, BUT ALSO

02:34:41.171 --> 02:34:42.640
WITHIN THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY AND

02:34:42.706 --> 02:34:43.941
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

02:34:44.008 --> 02:34:44.875
NATION TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

02:34:44.942 --> 02:34:46.143
WORKING TOGETHER. BECAUSE THE

02:34:46.210 --> 02:34:47.811
SOLE PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SURE

02:34:47.878 --> 02:34:49.813
THAT THOSE REMAINS GET BACK INTO

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.482
THE GROUND FOR PROPER REBURIAL.

02:34:51.548 --> 02:34:54.051
THAT'S A NUMBER ONE ISSUE. AS A

02:34:54.118 --> 02:34:56.954
CULTURAL PERSON FROM OUR AREA,

02:34:57.021 --> 02:34:58.689
AND HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THOSE

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:00.824
REMAINS GET BACK INTO THE GROUND

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.993
AND LOOKING AT A PROCESS THAT'S

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:05.963
THERE. AND AGAIN, REGURGITATING

02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:07.765
THAT THEY DIDN'T ASK TO GET DUG

02:35:07.831 --> 02:35:10.968
UP. THEY WEREN'T ASKED

02:35:11.035 --> 02:35:11.802
AFFILIATION WHEN IT WAS THERE.

02:35:11.869 --> 02:35:13.904
IT WAS COLONIZATION THAT FORCED

02:35:13.971 --> 02:35:15.673
THAT TO HAPPEN. AND WHAT WE'RE

02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:16.874
DEALING WITH HERE, AND SOME OF

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:18.542
THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'RE HEARING

02:35:18.609 --> 02:35:19.743
FROM TRIBAL LEADERS, GOES BACK

02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:22.146
TO THE VERY PREMISE OF

02:35:22.212 --> 02:35:23.881
COLONIZATION, CONQUER AND

02:35:23.947 --> 02:35:25.049
DIVIDE. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

02:35:25.115 --> 02:35:26.817
CONTINUING TO DO. BUT YET WHAT'S

02:35:26.884 --> 02:35:28.886
BEING HELD HOSTAGE ARE OUR

02:35:28.952 --> 02:35:30.754
ANCESTORS IN THOSE ARCHIVES AND

02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:31.955
THE UK'S CAL STATES AND EVEN

02:35:32.022 --> 02:35:33.991
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND WE ARE

02:35:34.058 --> 02:35:36.226
GOING TO LOOK INTO THOSE AREAS

02:35:36.293 --> 02:35:37.494
AS STATE AGENCIES, MAKING SURE

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:38.762
YOU DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

02:35:38.829 --> 02:35:40.164
START THOSE REPATRIATION PROCESS

02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:42.132
MOVING FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT

02:35:42.199 --> 02:35:43.801
THESE HEARINGS BRING OUT. A LOT

02:35:43.867 --> 02:35:45.202
OF THE BARRIERS THAT ARE THERE.

02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:47.004
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:35:47.071 --> 02:35:51.608
HEAR THAT. AND CHAIRMAN, I'M

02:35:51.675 --> 02:35:53.777
MUTSUN YOU'RE IN AN AREA THAT

02:35:53.844 --> 02:35:55.913
HAS BEEN THERE FOR SOME TIME.

02:35:55.979 --> 02:35:57.481
COLONIZATION DID TAKE PLACE.

02:35:57.548 --> 02:35:59.116
THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE TRIBES

02:35:59.183 --> 02:36:01.318
THERE, BUT YET A RECOGNITION

02:36:01.385 --> 02:36:05.089
FROM A FROM A GOVERNMENT THAT

02:36:05.155 --> 02:36:06.690
ANNIHILATED OUR PEOPLE, SHOT AND

02:36:06.757 --> 02:36:08.959
KILLED OUR PEOPLE, AND YET SAID,

02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:10.961
NOW I'LL GIVE YOU RECOGNITION.

02:36:11.028 --> 02:36:12.830
BUT YET THOSE THAT WERE DUG UP

02:36:12.896 --> 02:36:14.264
DIDN'T ASK FOR CONSENT. THEY

02:36:14.331 --> 02:36:16.166
DIDN'T ASK. THEY WERE DUG UP AND

02:36:16.233 --> 02:36:18.602
ARE NOW BEING HELD IN ARCHIVES.

02:36:18.669 --> 02:36:20.571
WE CAN'T NO LONGER MOVE FORWARD

02:36:20.637 --> 02:36:22.639
ON THE COLONIZATION PART. THAT'S

02:36:22.706 --> 02:36:24.842
WHY WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME

02:36:24.908 --> 02:36:26.076
TO TERMS AND IDENTIFY BARRIERS

02:36:26.143 --> 02:36:28.645
IN INDIAN COUNTRY, AS WELL AS

02:36:28.712 --> 02:36:30.314
BARRIERS AT THE UC SYSTEM, TO

02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:32.750
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE EXPEDITING

02:36:32.816 --> 02:36:34.451
THE REMAINS BACK TO THE RIGHTFUL

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:36.186
PEOPLE FOR PROPER REBURIAL. AND

02:36:36.253 --> 02:36:38.489
SO I DO WANT TO MENTION WE HEARD

02:36:38.555 --> 02:36:40.991
THE TESTIMONY FROM FROM THOSE

02:36:41.058 --> 02:36:43.026
HERE. AND THERE IS A PROCESS

02:36:43.093 --> 02:36:45.395
THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD ON.

02:36:45.462 --> 02:36:46.997
THERE IS A PROCESS THAT EVERY

02:36:47.064 --> 02:36:49.266
TIME WE MOVE FORWARD IN STATUTE,

02:36:49.333 --> 02:36:51.335
THAT IT STARTS TO BUILD MORE

02:36:51.401 --> 02:36:53.837
CRITERIA. BUT MAYBE WHAT WE NEED

02:36:53.904 --> 02:36:56.340
TO DO IS LESSEN THAT CRITERIA TO

02:36:56.406 --> 02:36:58.208
ENSURE THAT WE COULD ALL AGREE,

02:36:58.275 --> 02:37:00.144
AT LEAST HERE IN THE STATE OF

02:37:00.210 --> 02:37:01.545
CALIFORNIA, THAT THE NUMBER ONE

02:37:01.612 --> 02:37:02.946
ISSUE IS TO GET THOSE REMAINS

02:37:03.013 --> 02:37:05.082
BACK INTO THE GROUND AND WORKING

02:37:05.149 --> 02:37:07.985
TOGETHER ON THAT PROCESS MOVING

02:37:08.051 --> 02:37:10.254
FORWARD. AGAIN, THESE ARE ISSUES

02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:12.389
THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH IN

02:37:12.456 --> 02:37:14.691
2025, 35 YEARS AGO, THE LAWS

02:37:14.758 --> 02:37:17.027
MOVED FORWARD FOR REPATRIATION,

02:37:17.094 --> 02:37:19.396
BUT WE'RE STILL GRAPPLING WITH

02:37:19.463 --> 02:37:20.597
THOSE ISSUES IN 2025. I BELIEVE

02:37:20.664 --> 02:37:22.266
THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE STILL

02:37:22.332 --> 02:37:24.101
GRAPPLING TODAY ARE BEFORE US,

02:37:24.168 --> 02:37:25.969
BECAUSE OF THE COLONIZATION

02:37:26.036 --> 02:37:27.371
PROCESS THAT WAS TAKEN AGAINST

02:37:27.437 --> 02:37:29.640
OUR PEOPLE BACK BEFORE EVEN THE

02:37:29.706 --> 02:37:31.041
STATE BECAME A STATE. WHEN THE

02:37:31.108 --> 02:37:32.843
FIRST GOVERNOR PUT OUT BOUNTIES

02:37:32.910 --> 02:37:36.013
ON OUR PEOPLE, THAT TYPE OF THAT

02:37:36.079 --> 02:37:38.315
PART OF HISTORY STILL NEEDS TO

02:37:38.382 --> 02:37:42.219
COME FORWARD AS BEING A BARRIER

02:37:42.286 --> 02:37:42.886
TO REPATRIATION OF ALL THOSE

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:45.889
REMAINS THAT ARE THERE. I DON'T

02:37:45.956 --> 02:37:46.657
BELIEVE WE SHOULD MAKE IT

02:37:46.723 --> 02:37:49.459
HARDER. I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE

02:37:49.526 --> 02:37:50.828
IT EASIER TO GET THOSE REMAINS

02:37:50.894 --> 02:37:51.962
BACK INTO THE GROUND. AT LEAST

02:37:52.029 --> 02:37:53.897
THE REMAINS THAT ARE IN THE

02:37:53.964 --> 02:37:55.599
ARCHIVES OF THE UK'S CAL STATES

02:37:55.666 --> 02:37:57.367
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE HAVE

02:37:57.434 --> 02:37:58.735
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVE

02:37:58.802 --> 02:37:59.970
FORWARD AND GET THOSE REMAINS

02:38:00.037 --> 02:38:01.371
BACK INTO THE GROUND, AND THEN

02:38:01.438 --> 02:38:03.106
START DEVELOPING POLICY MOVING

02:38:03.173 --> 02:38:04.875
FORWARD. AS A UC'S ARE MOVING

02:38:04.942 --> 02:38:05.943
FORWARD AND LOOKING INTO THE

02:38:06.009 --> 02:38:07.578
FIELD SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE

02:38:07.644 --> 02:38:09.947
THEY HAVE THE BLESSING OF THE

02:38:10.013 --> 02:38:10.781
LOCAL TRIBES BEFORE THEY MOVE

02:38:10.848 --> 02:38:13.851
FORWARD ON ANY DIGGING GOING ON

02:38:13.917 --> 02:38:15.152
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

02:38:15.219 --> 02:38:15.853
CALIFORNIA. WE'RE LOOKING

02:38:15.919 --> 02:38:17.421
FORWARD TO SEEING THAT POLICY

02:38:17.487 --> 02:38:19.990
MOVE FORWARD, BUT ALSO TO THE

02:38:20.057 --> 02:38:23.627
UK'S BEING ABLE TO PUT OUT A

02:38:23.694 --> 02:38:25.796
DATE OF 2028 OF WHERE YOU WANT

02:38:25.863 --> 02:38:27.197
TO MOVE FORWARD IN COMPLIANCE

02:38:27.264 --> 02:38:28.732
WITH THE REMAINS THAT ARE IN

02:38:28.799 --> 02:38:30.434
YOUR ARCHIVES. BUT AS CHAIRMAN

02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:32.269
POTTER SO ELOQUENTLY PUT, A LOT

02:38:32.336 --> 02:38:35.138
OF THOSE REMAINS ARE TIED WITH

02:38:35.205 --> 02:38:36.974
BURIAL GOODS THAT ARE THERE WITH

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:37.674
THEM BEADS, DIFFERENT THINGS

02:38:37.741 --> 02:38:39.209
THAT ARE THERE THAT WE NEED TO

02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:40.777
BE TAKING A LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:42.713
THAT IF WE'RE COMPLYING, THAT

02:38:42.779 --> 02:38:43.981
WE'RE NOT HASTILY NOW TRYING TO

02:38:44.047 --> 02:38:45.983
MAKE UP FOR 35 YEARS, THAT WE'RE

02:38:46.049 --> 02:38:48.051
OVERSTEPPING THINGS THAT NEED TO

02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:49.353
BE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AS THEY

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:50.554
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:52.055
COMPLETE THEIR JOURNEY. AS

02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:56.460
OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON. SO

02:38:56.526 --> 02:38:58.896
THIS BODY HAS HEARD THE

02:38:58.962 --> 02:39:00.664
TESTIMONY. WE ARE GOING TO LOOK

02:39:00.731 --> 02:39:02.366
TOGETHER ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:39:02.432 --> 02:39:03.667
FROM THE AUDITOR, AND WE ARE

02:39:03.734 --> 02:39:06.069
GOING TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

02:39:06.136 --> 02:39:07.838
THE PROCESS THAT TRIBAL LEADERS

02:39:07.905 --> 02:39:09.640
AND OTHERS HAVE BROUGHT UP

02:39:09.706 --> 02:39:12.342
BEFORE US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:39:12.409 --> 02:39:14.711
GARCIA, THE AUDIT. THE AUDITOR'S

02:39:14.778 --> 02:39:16.747
PURPOSE IS TO AUDIT REGULATIONS

02:39:16.813 --> 02:39:18.649
AND STATUTE THAT HAS MOVED

02:39:18.715 --> 02:39:21.551
FORWARD. SO THE COMPONENT OF THE

02:39:21.618 --> 02:39:25.122
AUDITOR REACHING OUT TO TRIBES

02:39:25.188 --> 02:39:25.789
FOR REPATRIATION, THAT'S A

02:39:25.856 --> 02:39:27.724
SEPARATE PROCESS. THE AUDITOR

02:39:27.791 --> 02:39:30.027
HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. THREE

02:39:30.093 --> 02:39:31.895
THREE AUDITS ON THIS TOPIC AND

02:39:31.962 --> 02:39:33.563
SEVERAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION

02:39:33.630 --> 02:39:35.132
THAT CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD,

02:39:35.198 --> 02:39:36.967
MAKING SURE THAT TRIBAL

02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:39.236
KNOWLEDGE IS AT THE FOREFRONT.

02:39:39.303 --> 02:39:41.305
AND I STILL BELIEVE THAT THAT

02:39:41.371 --> 02:39:44.207
NEEDS TO BE THERE. BUT I DO

02:39:44.274 --> 02:39:45.943
DEEPLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE

02:39:46.009 --> 02:39:47.444
DEALING WITH REPATRIATION. WE'RE

02:39:47.511 --> 02:39:48.645
DEALING WITH ITEMS THAT ARE IN

02:39:48.712 --> 02:39:50.714
THE FACILITIES OF THE UCS, THE

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:52.215
CAL STATES AND COMMUNITY

02:39:52.282 --> 02:39:53.951
COLLEGES THAT WERE BROUGHT ON

02:39:54.017 --> 02:39:57.187
THROUGH COLONIZATION, DIVIDING,

02:39:57.254 --> 02:39:58.522
CONQUERING, DIVIDING OUR PEOPLE

02:39:58.588 --> 02:40:00.223
AND PITTING ONE AGAINST ANOTHER.

02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:03.293
IT'S TIME THAT WE UNITE THROUGH

02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:04.461
LEGISLATION NOW THAT THAT WE'RE

02:40:04.528 --> 02:40:07.264
HERE AND THROUGH A BODY TO

02:40:07.331 --> 02:40:08.899
ENSURE THAT THE NUMBER ONE GOAL

02:40:08.966 --> 02:40:10.834
IS THE REPATRIATION OF ALL THOSE

02:40:10.901 --> 02:40:12.970
REMAINS THAT ARE IN THE ARCHIVES

02:40:13.036 --> 02:40:14.738
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

02:40:14.805 --> 02:40:17.040
WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD ON

02:40:17.107 --> 02:40:20.277
THAT. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK

02:40:20.344 --> 02:40:21.311
ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR COMING

02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:23.513
FORWARD, AND WE CONTINUE LOOK

02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:25.349
FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER ON

02:40:25.415 --> 02:40:26.383
BRINGING RESOLVE TO THESE

02:40:26.450 --> 02:40:28.552
ISSUES. THE DATE 2028 IS

02:40:28.618 --> 02:40:29.753
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:32.222
KEEP IN MIND, AND WE'RE GOING TO

02:40:32.289 --> 02:40:33.991
KEEP WORKING WITH THE UCS TO SEE

02:40:34.057 --> 02:40:36.093
HOW WE COULD GET TO THE PILLARS

02:40:36.159 --> 02:40:38.595
OF EDUCATION THERE, TO PUT OUT

02:40:38.662 --> 02:40:40.731
THAT REPATRIATION IS ONE OF THE

02:40:40.797 --> 02:40:42.466
PILLARS OF THE UCS, AND WE'LL

02:40:42.532 --> 02:40:44.401
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE, THESE

02:40:44.468 --> 02:40:45.902
AREAS. SO I WANT TO THANK THE

02:40:45.969 --> 02:40:46.970
PRESENTERS HERE AND THE

02:40:47.037 --> 02:40:48.739
PRESENTERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

02:40:48.805 --> 02:40:51.274
AND YOUR PERSONAL TESTIMONY,

02:40:51.341 --> 02:40:53.010
BRINGING FORWARD THESE ISSUES

02:40:53.076 --> 02:40:54.444
THAT ARE STILL PLAGUING OUR

02:40:54.511 --> 02:40:56.947
PEOPLE IN 2025. WHEN YOU LOOK

02:40:57.014 --> 02:40:58.749
BACK, THIS IS NOTHING NEW. AND

02:40:58.815 --> 02:41:00.283
WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT

02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:01.551
UNIVERSITIES, THIS AND THAT. BUT

02:41:01.618 --> 02:41:03.787
WHEN YOU GO BACK AND RESEARCH,

02:41:03.854 --> 02:41:06.356
ISHI, THAT STARTED THE WHOLE

02:41:06.423 --> 02:41:07.557
PROCESS AND WE'RE STILL SITTING

02:41:07.624 --> 02:41:10.694
HERE IN 2025, I THINK IT'S BEEN

02:41:10.761 --> 02:41:12.262
TOO LONG, TOO LONG FOR OUR

02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:13.663
ANCESTORS TO BE IN THOSE

02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:14.998
ARCHIVES. IT'S TIME THAT WE ALL

02:41:15.065 --> 02:41:15.999
START WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE

02:41:16.066 --> 02:41:17.667
SURE THAT WE BRING THOSE

02:41:17.734 --> 02:41:19.336
ANCESTORS HOME FOR PROPER

02:41:19.403 --> 02:41:20.871
REBURIAL. WITH THAT, I WANT TO

02:41:20.937 --> 02:41:22.439
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY,

02:41:22.506 --> 02:41:24.141
AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO

02:41:24.207 --> 02:41:29.746
PUBLIC COMMENT. MR. CHAIR,

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:31.515
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, PAULA,

02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:35.185
TREAT US THREE AUDITS 30 YEARS.

02:41:35.252 --> 02:41:37.387
I MAY BE THE ONLY LOBBYIST WHO'S

02:41:37.454 --> 02:41:40.424
BEEN FIGHTING THIS FOR 30 YEARS.

02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:41.958
LONG TIME COMING. I WOULD ASK

02:41:42.025 --> 02:41:44.161
YOU TO ALSO TAKE INTO

02:41:44.227 --> 02:41:44.895
CONSIDERATION THAT THERE ARE

02:41:44.961 --> 02:41:48.398
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS THAT

02:41:48.465 --> 02:41:50.067
PROFESSORS AND FORMER PROFESSORS

02:41:50.133 --> 02:41:52.002
AND ARCHEOLOGISTS HAVE, AND

02:41:52.069 --> 02:41:53.503
THOSE NEED TO BE REPATRIATED,

02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:55.338
TOO. AND MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME

02:41:55.405 --> 02:41:57.040
LEGISLATION AT SOME POINT THAT

02:41:57.107 --> 02:41:59.242
MAKES THAT MANDATORY. THANK YOU

02:41:59.309 --> 02:42:01.244
FOR YOUR COMMENTS. TRIBAL

02:42:01.311 --> 02:42:01.978
LEADERS HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH

02:42:02.045 --> 02:42:05.682
THIS ALL OF OUR LIVES. NEXT

02:42:05.749 --> 02:42:16.426
PUBLIC COMMENT. ANY OTHER PUBLIC

02:42:16.493 --> 02:42:23.133
COMMENT? HELLO, MY NAME IS PAUL

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:28.305
TUPAZ. THERE WAS SOME REFERENCE

02:42:28.371 --> 02:42:31.541
TO TRIBAL STUDENTS PARTICIPATING

02:42:31.608 --> 02:42:34.177
IN CONTRIBUTING AT THE ACADEMICS

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:36.346
AND ANTHROPOLOGY AND SO FORTH.

02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:38.381
AND I JUST WANT TO ASK, AS A

02:42:38.448 --> 02:42:39.816
FATHER, AS A FATHER TO TRIBAL

02:42:39.883 --> 02:42:42.085
CHILDREN IS A YOU SEE IN THE

02:42:42.152 --> 02:42:44.254
STATE SYSTEMS PREPARED TO

02:42:44.321 --> 02:42:46.690
WELCOME, ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:51.061
TRIBAL STUDENTS IS THE HOSTILE

02:42:51.128 --> 02:42:54.631
ENVIRONMENT TOXIC, SYSTEMICALLY

02:42:54.698 --> 02:42:57.934
HARMFUL, HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT

02:42:58.001 --> 02:43:02.205
CHANGED? HAS THERE BEEN A PIVOT?

02:43:02.272 --> 02:43:04.307
AND I ASK THAT BECAUSE AS A

02:43:04.374 --> 02:43:06.877
PARENT, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR

02:43:06.943 --> 02:43:08.678
CHILDREN ARE TAKEN CARE OF, OUR

02:43:08.745 --> 02:43:10.480
STUDENTS ARE TAKEN CARE OF. BUT

02:43:10.547 --> 02:43:13.016
TO MAKE A STATEMENT AND SAY

02:43:13.083 --> 02:43:15.185
TRIBAL PEOPLE NEED TO BE PART OF

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:18.054
THE SOLUTION. AND THIS THIS

02:43:18.121 --> 02:43:19.289
DEFICIENCY IS BECAUSE THERE'S

02:43:19.356 --> 02:43:21.458
NOT ENOUGH TRIBAL EXPERTS

02:43:21.525 --> 02:43:23.126
THROUGH THE ACADEMIC SYSTEM. YOU

02:43:23.193 --> 02:43:25.095
KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS,

02:43:25.162 --> 02:43:27.731
BUT THAT THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE

02:43:27.797 --> 02:43:29.533
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE'S

02:43:29.599 --> 02:43:33.470
THESE DEFICIENCIES. AND AS A

02:43:33.537 --> 02:43:35.872
PARENT, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:38.642
THAT THERE'S A CHANGE. THERE'S A

02:43:38.708 --> 02:43:42.812
CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEMS. AND SO I

02:43:42.879 --> 02:43:45.348
MYSELF AM A GRADUATE OF A NATIVE

02:43:45.415 --> 02:43:46.983
AMERICAN STUDIES DEPARTMENT AND

02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:49.052
WAS EXPECTED TO TAKE

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:51.221
ANTHROPOLOGY AND TO HAVE

02:43:51.288 --> 02:43:52.656
SOMEBODY TALK ABOUT COLLECTIONS,

02:43:52.722 --> 02:43:54.491
TO HAVE SOMEBODY TALK ABOUT

02:43:54.558 --> 02:43:55.492
INVENTORIES, TO HAVE SOMEBODY

02:43:55.559 --> 02:43:57.761
SAY, YOU KNOW, A PROFESSOR, I'M

02:43:57.827 --> 02:44:00.197
NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ONE BONE

02:44:00.263 --> 02:44:03.200
BECAUSE THIS IS MINE. I DON'T

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:04.234
WANT MY CHILDREN TO EXPERIENCE

02:44:04.301 --> 02:44:07.871
THAT. SO MY QUESTION IS, HAS

02:44:07.938 --> 02:44:11.107
THAT CHANGED? THANK YOU. THANK

02:44:11.174 --> 02:44:14.211
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS.

02:44:14.277 --> 02:44:19.015
NEXT PUBLIC COMMENT. JAMIE

02:44:19.082 --> 02:44:20.317
SUNWAY. MY NAME IS MORNINGSTAR

02:44:20.383 --> 02:44:23.286
GALLEY. I AM A TRIBAL MEMBER

02:44:23.353 --> 02:44:24.788
ENROLLED WITH THE AHJUMAWI BAND

02:44:24.854 --> 02:44:28.024
OF THE PIT RIVER TRIBE. MY

02:44:28.091 --> 02:44:31.795
FAMILY WAS A PART OF AND ALSO

02:44:31.861 --> 02:44:34.064
LED BY CHAIRMAN POTTER, WHO'S

02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:37.634
HERE PART OF ISHII'S

02:44:37.701 --> 02:44:39.369
REPATRIATION. AND WE'RE REALLY

02:44:39.436 --> 02:44:40.837
INVOLVED WITH THAT. AND THAT WAS

02:44:40.904 --> 02:44:43.740
SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, WAS

02:44:43.807 --> 02:44:47.377
REALLY IMPACTFUL WHEN I WAS A

02:44:47.444 --> 02:44:49.145
TEENAGER. AND JUST THE PROCESS

02:44:49.212 --> 02:44:51.748
OF HOW LONG THAT THAT TOOK FOR

02:44:51.815 --> 02:44:53.850
OVER 20 YEARS SINCE SINCE I WAS

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:56.720
A COLLEGE STUDENT, WE HAVE BEEN

02:44:56.786 --> 02:44:59.055
CHALLENGING UC'S FAILURE TO

02:44:59.122 --> 02:45:01.758
COMPLY WITH NAGPRA. DECADES.

02:45:01.825 --> 02:45:03.593
DECADES LATER, èC CONTINUES TO

02:45:03.660 --> 02:45:06.463
TREAT REPATRIATION AS OPTIONAL.

02:45:06.529 --> 02:45:08.498
èC STILL HOLDS THOUSANDS OF OUR

02:45:08.565 --> 02:45:09.633
ANCESTORS AND HUNDREDS OF

02:45:09.699 --> 02:45:12.235
THOUSANDS OF SACRED ITEMS, OFTEN

02:45:12.302 --> 02:45:14.371
UNCOUNTED, MISHANDLED, AND EVEN

02:45:14.437 --> 02:45:15.872
STOLEN. AT THIS PACE, IT COULD

02:45:15.939 --> 02:45:17.340
TAKE ANOTHER DECADE OR MORE

02:45:17.407 --> 02:45:19.109
BEFORE THEY ARE RETURNED. THIS

02:45:19.175 --> 02:45:21.311
IS NOT DELAY. THIS IS CULTURAL

02:45:21.378 --> 02:45:23.613
AND SPIRITUAL VIOLENCE. OUR

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.482
ANCESTORS ARE NOT COLLECTIONS.

02:45:25.548 --> 02:45:27.917
THEY DESERVE REVERENCE AND

02:45:27.984 --> 02:45:30.153
RETURN. THE UC SYSTEM, BUILT ON

02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:32.222
MORAL LAND GRANTS, WAS TAKEN

02:45:32.289 --> 02:45:34.090
FROM TRIBAL NATIONS, AND THESE

02:45:34.157 --> 02:45:35.325
ENDOWMENTS SHALL NOW FUND

02:45:35.392 --> 02:45:37.160
URGENT, ACCOUNTABLE

02:45:37.227 --> 02:45:39.162
REPATRIATION. INSTEAD, STATE

02:45:39.229 --> 02:45:42.098
FUNDS SIT IDLE OR MISUSED. WILL

02:45:42.165 --> 02:45:44.234
UC HIDES BEHIND FEDERAL

02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:45.669
TECHNICALITIES TO DENY

02:45:45.735 --> 02:45:46.936
NON-FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:48.938
THEIR RIGHTS UNDER NAGPRA. THIS

02:45:49.005 --> 02:45:51.107
IS A DIRECT ASSAULT ON

02:45:51.174 --> 02:45:52.909
CALIFORNIA TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY.

02:45:52.976 --> 02:45:54.744
THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

02:45:54.811 --> 02:45:56.179
MUST SET CLEAR STANDARDS,

02:45:56.246 --> 02:45:58.615
TIMELINES, AND OVERSIGHT, AS THE

02:45:58.682 --> 02:46:00.684
LEGISLATURE MUST REQUIRE DIRECT

02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:02.218
APPROPRIATIONS WITH TRIBAL

02:46:02.285 --> 02:46:03.920
ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERFORMANCE

02:46:03.987 --> 02:46:06.556
METRICS. THE AUDITOR GAVE A

02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:08.024
ROADMAP. THIS IS YEAR THREE. NOW

02:46:08.091 --> 02:46:10.493
THAT WE HAVE SAT HERE IN THESE

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:11.995
HEARINGS, THE SOLUTIONS ARE HERE

02:46:12.062 --> 02:46:14.064
IN BLACK AND WHITE. AND WHAT'S

02:46:14.130 --> 02:46:16.299
MISSING IS UC'S LEADERSHIP AND

02:46:16.366 --> 02:46:18.468
WILLINGNESS TO ACT WITH URGENCY,

02:46:18.535 --> 02:46:20.937
RESPECT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:46:21.004 --> 02:46:22.706
REPATRIATION IS NOT A FAVOR.

02:46:22.772 --> 02:46:25.208
IT'S THE LAW AND IT'S DECADES

02:46:25.275 --> 02:46:27.043
OVERDUE. OUR ANCESTORS MUST AND

02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:30.413
DESERVE TO COME HOME. SO THANK

02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:36.753
YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD

02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:38.988
MORNING. THANK YOU FOR THIS

02:46:39.055 --> 02:46:41.057
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS

02:46:41.124 --> 02:46:42.659
JOINT HEARING ON NAGPRA

02:46:42.726 --> 02:46:44.327
COMPLIANCE. MY NAME IS MONICA

02:46:44.394 --> 02:46:45.795
STRAUSS, PRESIDENT OF THE

02:46:45.862 --> 02:46:47.597

ARCHEOLOGY, A 1300 MEMBER

02:46:50.233 --> 02:46:52.168
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION

02:46:52.235 --> 02:46:55.505
ESTABLISHED IN 1966. THE SCA

02:46:55.572 --> 02:46:56.973
MISSION IS DEDICATED TO

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:59.142
RESEARCH, UNDERSTANDING,

02:46:59.209 --> 02:47:00.744
INTERPRETATION, AND CONSERVATION

UNIVERSITY AND INSTITUTION, AND

02:50:30.887 --> 02:50:32.855
THOSE ENDOWMENT FUNDS ARE

02:50:32.922 --> 02:50:34.457
SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR ENDOWMENT

02:50:34.524 --> 02:50:35.391
