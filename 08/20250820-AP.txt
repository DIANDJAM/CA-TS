00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:55.445
WHAT TEXAS IS DOING. AND IT'S

00:46:55.512 --> 00:46:57.247
BECAUSE THE IMPACT TO

00:46:57.314 --> 00:46:58.415
CALIFORNIANS IS SO GREAT. AND

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:01.451
IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HAVE A

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:03.086
FAIR ELECTION, IF WE'RE NOT

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:05.222
ABLE TO FIGHT BACK IN THE WAY

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:06.423
THAT WE NEED TO, WE'RE NOT

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.091
STANDING UP FOR OUR VALUES HERE

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.793
IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.294
CERTAINLY NOT DEFENDING

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.995
CALIFORNIANS. IF YOU REMEMBER

00:47:12.062 --> 00:47:15.799
HEARING CALIFORNIA, 67% OF

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:18.135
VOTERS VOTED TO ENSURE THAT

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.770
CALIFORNIA'S REPRODUCTIVE

00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:20.804
FREEDOM STATE THAT OUR

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:23.207
CONSTITUTION ENSURES THAT

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.341
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:26.476
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. WHAT

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:30.547
JUST PASSED IN CONGRESS DEFUNDS

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.616
PLANNED PARENTHOOD ON DAY ONE.

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.618
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE COST

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.286
OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY, JUST

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:39.256
ON THAT ONE PIECE OF THAT BILL

00:47:39.323 --> 00:47:42.359
ALONE IS TAKING AWAY $300

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:45.229
MILLION IN FEDERAL DOLLARS AWAY

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.331
FROM THE SERVICES THAT PLANNED

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:49.066
PARENTHOOD PROVIDES. AND WE ARE

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.300
NOT TALKING ABOUT ABORTION

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.336
SERVICES. THOSE ARE ALREADY NOT

00:47:52.402 --> 00:47:53.103
FEDERALLY FUNDED. WE ARE

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.539
TALKING ABOUT EVERY OTHER

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.207
SERVICE THAT 1 IN 4 WOMEN HERE

00:47:57.274 --> 00:48:00.877
IN CALIFORNIA RELY ON, WHICH IS

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:02.446
CANCER SCREENINGS, BIRTH

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:05.282
CONTROL, OFTENTIMES PRENATAL

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.084
CARE. THE REST OF THAT BILL HAS

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.254
THREE, 3.5 MILLION FOLKS IN

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.523
CALIFORNIA THAT WILL BE WITHOUT

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.126
HEALTH CARE IN OUR STATE, NOT

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:18.161
TO MENTION THE OTHER ECONOMIC

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.497
SANCTIONS. THANK YOU. SO IT'S

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:22.199
IMPERATIVE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:24.067
FIGHT BACK. WE KNOW IF PLANNED

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:25.636
PARENTHOOD OR ANYONE ELSE TALKS

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:27.537
ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF WHAT JUST

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:28.171
HAPPENED, CONGRESS MEMBERS WILL

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:30.107
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT WE'RE

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:32.075
NOT ABLE TO DO THAT IF TEXAS IS

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:33.343
RIGGING THE ELECTION AHEAD OF

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.513
TIME. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.448
AND YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES.

00:48:38.515 --> 00:48:40.617
THANK YOU. I'M TRINA TURNER,

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:42.452
PASTOR EXECUTIVE PASTOR ALSO

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:44.554
THOUGH, HERE TODAY AS A

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.355
COMMISSIONER FOR THE 2020

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:47.057
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. AND

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:49.359
I'LL READ SO THAT I CAN MAKE

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:51.128
BEST USE OF MY TIME. I AM PROUD

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:53.130
TO HAVE SERVED IN THE 2020

00:48:53.196 --> 00:48:54.598
CALIFORNIA CITIZENS

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:55.265
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION,

00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:57.167
FOLLOWING THE WILL OF THE

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.769
PEOPLE, TO DRAW THE FAIR MAPS

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:00.003
THAT HONOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.205
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST. OUR

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:04.241
WORK, YOU KNOW, WAS ROOTED IN

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:05.242
INDEPENDENCE, TRANSPARENCY,

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.244
CLEAR VOTER MANDATE THAT THE

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:08.412
POLITICIANS SHOULD NOT CHOOSE

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:10.080
THEIR VOTERS. BUT WE HAVE TO BE

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:11.415
HONEST, IN THE MOMENT THAT

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.550
WE'RE IN, THERE'S A BREACH OF

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.018
TRUST IN OUR DEMOCRACY THAT HAS

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:16.186
ALREADY HAPPENED, AND IT'S

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:17.688
HITTING BLACK AND BROWN

00:49:17.754 --> 00:49:18.221
COMMUNITIES HARDEST. WE'VE

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:19.222
WATCHED OUR CURRENT

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:21.224
ADMINISTRATION DISMANTLE DEI

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:22.993
PROGRAMS, SEND IN NATIONAL

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.228
GUARD AND MARINES INTO LA, DC

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:26.997
UNDER FALSE CLAIMS OF KEEPING

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.665
ORDER OR STAMPING OUT RAMPANT

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:31.001
CRIME. THE REALITY CRIME IS

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:32.135
ALREADY BEEN DOWN IN MANY OF

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:34.137
THOSE AREAS, BUT THE VERY

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:35.505
PROGRAMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES,

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:37.207
THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:39.242
WORK, THEY'RE BEING CUT,

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:40.510
CREATING THE VERY INSTABILITY

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:42.245
THAT WILL BE USED TO JUSTIFY

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:44.981
MORE FORCE AND MORE CONTROL AND

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:46.483
FEWER RIGHTS. SO IT'S

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.251
SHORTSIGHTED FOR CALIFORNIA TO

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:50.220
ONLY THINK ABOUT CALIFORNIA. I

00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:51.788
WATCHED THE HEARINGS ON

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:52.956
YESTERDAY AND WANTED TO SAY

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:55.559
THAT IF WE STAND ON PRINCIPLE

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:56.393
WHILE OUR NATION DISINTEGRATES,

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.961
WE'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM. AND

00:49:58.028 --> 00:49:59.262
ARE WE REALLY THINKING ABOUT

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.431
ALL OF CALIFORNIA? BECAUSE I

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:03.033
THINK THE 3.1 MILLION CHILDREN,

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.434
VETERANS AND FAMILIES IN

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:05.235
CALIFORNIA THAT WILL LOSE FOOD

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:07.204
OFF OF THEIR TABLES WILL TEND

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.740
TO AGREE. CALIFORNIA. I THINK

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.441
THE 2.4 MILLION CALIFORNIANS

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:13.176
THAT WILL LOSE ACCESS TO HEALTH

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:15.112
CARE DUE TO MEDICAID CUTS WOULD

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:16.947
DISAGREE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:50:17.013 --> 00:50:19.082
DISCUSSION ABOUT PROTECTING

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.350
LINES DRAWN BY THE WILL OF THE

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:22.652
PEOPLE, LINES THAT I'M VERY

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.121
PROUD OF. HOWEVER, THE

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:25.956
DISCUSSION IS EMPHASIZING THE

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:28.191
IMPORTANCE OF INDEPENDENT

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:30.260
REDISTRICTING. THAT'S FAIR, BUT

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:32.462
WE'RE DOING THAT ON AT THE COST

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.498
OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS.

00:50:34.564 --> 00:50:36.133
THERE ARE GROUPS THAT I RESPECT

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:38.101
THAT SAYS THAT THEY, AT NEWSOM

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:39.936
IS DEAD WRONG IN THIS.

00:50:40.003 --> 00:50:41.037
GERRYMANDERING IS A THREAT.

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:43.173
HOWEVER, I WANT TO SAY THAT

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.408
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IS THE

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:47.477
EXACT REASON WHY WE NEED TO

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:49.312
MOVE FORWARD WITH ACA. I'M IN

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:51.248
TOTAL SUPPORT OF IT AND BELIEVE

00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:52.849
IT THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.117
NATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.219
WILL NOW TURN TO FOLKS IN THE

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:58.221
ROOM WHO WISH TO EXPRESS

00:50:58.288 --> 00:51:01.158
SUPPORT FOR ACA AND FOR

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:02.292
EVERYONE WHO'S WISHING TO

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:04.761
SUPPRESS SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION.

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.696
WE ARE JUST DOING NAME

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:29.286
GO TO OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES IN

00:51:29.352 --> 00:51:31.288
OPPOSITION. IF THEY COULD STEP

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:49.439
UP. IS THERE ONLY ONE PRIMARY

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.942
WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WHO WE

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:55.345
RECOGNIZE HERE? SINCE THERE'S

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:57.380
ONLY ONE, WE'LL GIVE YOU FOUR

00:51:57.447 --> 00:52:07.591
MINUTES. I OBJECT. AND IF YOU

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:10.227
COULD TURN YOUR MIC ON, PLEASE.

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:12.262
OKAY. HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY CAN

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:14.364
HEAR ME. I'M ASSEMBLYMAN TOM

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:16.700
LACKEY, AND I'M THE REPUBLICAN

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:17.434
CAUCUS CHAIR. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

GALLAGHER IS UNABLE TO BE HERE,

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:21.505
SO I'D LIKE TO READ HIS

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.439
STATEMENT INTO THE RECORD. IF

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:24.107
I'M PERMITTED TO DO SO. I WOULD

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:26.243
LOVE THAT, PLEASE. IN

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:27.477
CALIFORNIA, WE'VE ALWAYS

00:52:27.544 --> 00:52:29.479
CLAIMED TO BE A STATE THAT DOES

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:30.146
THINGS BETTER, CLEANER

00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:32.482
GOVERNMENT, MORE TRANSPARENCY,

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:33.250
A STRONGER COMMITMENT TO

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:35.519
FAIRNESS. MORE THAN A DECADE

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.988
AGO, VOTERS PROVIDED PROVED

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:40.156
THAT VERY POINT BY TAKING ONE

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:41.324
OF THE MOST POWERFUL POLITICAL

00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.526
WEAPONS OUT OF POLITICIANS

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:45.762
HANDS. THAT IS, THIS ISSUE OF

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:46.997
REDISTRICTING. THEY CREATED THE

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:48.698
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

00:52:48.765 --> 00:52:50.233
COMMISSION, WHERE EVERYDAY

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.369
CALIFORNIANS, NOT CAREER

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:54.204
POLITICIANS, DRAW POLITICAL

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:56.072
MAPS. NO BACKROOM DEALS, NO

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:58.341
PARTY BOSSES, NO LOBBYISTS

00:52:58.408 --> 00:53:01.077
CALLING THE SHOTS. THE RESULT

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:03.280
MAPS SHAPED BY PUBLIC TESTIMONY,

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:05.682
NOT RAW POLITICAL MUSCLE

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:07.617
COMMUNITIES KEPT TOGETHER,

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:10.754
COMPETITIVE DISTRICTS PRESERVED,

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.188
TRUST IN THE PROCESS RESTORED.

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:14.958
IT WASN'T A REPUBLICAN IDEA OR

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.660
DEMOCRATIC IDEA. IT WAS THE

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:18.228
PEOPLE'S IDEA. AND IT WORKED.

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.397
NOW SACRAMENTO POLITICIANS WANT

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:22.966
TO TAKE IT BACK. CALIFORNIA

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.301
DEMOCRATS WITH GOVERNOR GAVIN

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:26.236
NEWSOM SUPPORT, ARE PROPOSING

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:28.004
TO RIP THIS POWER AWAY FROM THE

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:29.172
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AND PUT

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:31.308
IT BACK UNDER POLITICAL CONTROL.

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:34.144
THEIR GOAL? PROTECT A FEW MORAL.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:36.313
I'M SORRY, A FEW MORE SEATS IN

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:39.516
CONGRESS. THEIR EXCUSE TEXAS IS

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:41.151
DOING IT. THAT'S NOT LEADERSHIP.

00:53:41.217 --> 00:53:44.654
IT'S ABANDONING OUR PRINCIPLES.

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:46.089
REDISTRICTING IS HOW

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:48.258
POLITICIANS DECIDE WHO WINS

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.193
BEFORE VOTERS GET A SAY. IT'S

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.396
THE MOST BRAZEN WAY TO RIG THE

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:55.165
SYSTEM WHEN DISTRICT LINES ARE

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.467
DRAWN FOR POLITICAL ADVANTAGE.

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:59.235
THE FIRST CASUALTY IS OFTEN

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:01.671
FAIR REPRESENTATION, RURAL

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:02.305
COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR, RISK

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:04.207
BEING CARVED APART AND THEIR

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:06.476
VOICES DILUTED. RURAL

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.011
CALIFORNIANS LOSE THE UNIFIED

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:10.213
VOICE THAT ENSURES OUR UNIQUE

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.748
NEEDS AND AND PRIORITIES ARE

00:54:11.815 --> 00:54:14.017
HEARD. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:15.251
CALIFORNIANS STRIP THE

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:17.053
LEGISLATURE OF THIS POWER IN

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.756
THE FIRST PLACE, GIVING IT BACK

00:54:19.823 --> 00:54:22.125
TO THE VERY PEOPLE VOTERS TOOK

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:25.261
IT FROM ISN'T REFORM. IT'S RAW

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:28.264
POWER GRAB, AND VOTERS SEE

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:30.700
THROUGH IT. A RECENT POLITICO

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:33.203
POLL POSSIBLY INDICATED THAT

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:35.038
CALIFORNIANS OPPOSE RETURNING

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:36.072
REDISTRICTING TO THE

00:54:36.139 --> 00:54:38.975
LEGISLATURE BY NEARLY 2 TO 1.

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:42.212
ONLY 36% SUPPORT THIS SCHEME.

00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:44.881
THAT'S NOT A DEBATE. IT'S A

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.549
PUBLIC REJECTION. THIS IS

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:47.183
BIGGER THAN PARTY LABELS.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.652
WHETHER YOU'RE REPUBLICAN,

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:49.486
DEMOCRAT OR INDEPENDENT, YOU

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:51.488
LOSE WHEN POLITICIANS DRAW

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:53.623
THEIR OWN DISTRICTS.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.091
COMMUNITIES ARE CARVED UP LIKE

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:57.994
A PIE. COMPETITIVE RACES VANISH.

00:54:58.061 --> 00:54:59.229
POLITICIANS STOP WORRYING ABOUT

00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:00.463
WHAT VOTERS THINK BECAUSE THEIR

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.298
DISTRICTS ARE LOCKED UP FOR

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:05.835
YEARS. VOTERS LOSE. DEMOCRACY

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.103
LOSES. CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE THE

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.372
MODEL FOR THE NATION, NOT A

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:11.675
STATE THAT TOSSES OUT REFORMS

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:13.443
THE MINUTE THEY INCONVENIENCE

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.578
THOSE IN POWER. WE SHOWED

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:16.179
AMERICA THAT REDISTRICTING CAN

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:18.214
BE DONE OPENLY, FAIRLY, AND

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:20.250
WITHOUT PARTIZAN MANIPULATION.

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:22.585
THROWING IT AWAY NOW TELLS

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:23.420
EVERY VOTER THAT FAIRNESS ONLY

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.355
MATTERS WHEN IT'S POLITICALLY

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:28.391
CONVENIENT. ONE PARTIZAN

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:30.093
CONTROL IS BACK IN THE GAME. IT

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.395
NEVER LEAVES. ONCE PARTIZAN

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:34.064
CONTROL IS BACK IN THE GAME, IT

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:35.265
NEVER LEAVES AND THE PEOPLE

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:37.267
WILL LOSE THEIR VOICE. IF

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.002
GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND THE

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:40.103
LEGISLATIVE DEMOCRATS THINK

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.371
VOTERS WILL QUIETLY WATCH THEM

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.006
DISMANTLE ONE OF THE STATE'S

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:44.040
MOST IMPORTANT DEMOCRATIC

00:55:44.107 --> 00:55:46.576
SAFEGUARDS, THEY'RE IN FOR A

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:48.278
SURPRISE. THE OUTCRY WILL BE

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:49.779
LOUD, BIPARTISAN AND

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:51.314
UNRELENTING. THIS ISN'T

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:53.183
COMPLICATED. OUR DEMOCRACY

00:55:53.249 --> 00:55:55.385
WORKS BEST WHEN POLITICIANS

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:57.120
HAVE TO COMPETE FOR THEIR VOTES,

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:58.521
NOT WHEN THEY MANIPULATE THE

00:55:58.588 --> 00:56:00.023
RULES TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.125
POWER. THAT'S WHY THE VOTERS

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:03.293
PASSED REDISTRICTING REFORM,

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:05.061
AND THAT'S WHY THEY STILL WILL

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:07.063
SUPPORT IT. THE MESSAGE FROM

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.498
THE VOTERS IS SIMPLE THE POWER

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:10.333
BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. LET'S

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.634
KEEP IT THAT WAY AND WE WON'T

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:15.371
LET THEM TAKE IT. I'M ALSO

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:17.240
CONFUSED, TO SOME DEGREE, HOW

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:18.408
REDISTRICTING BILLS ARE NOT

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:20.143
BEING SENT TO SUSPENSE WHEN

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.479
IT'S BEEN VERY PUBLICLY STATED

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:24.848
THAT THESE BILLS WILL RESULT IN

00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:26.349
A $200 MILLION COST TO THE

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:29.319
STATE, YOU'RE AT FOUR MINUTES.

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:31.254
OKAY, WELL, THE LAST THING THAT

00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:33.089
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE WITH IS I. I

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:35.358
FIND IT A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:38.161
THAT I HAVE SOMEONE SITTING ON

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:42.065
THIS DAIS WITH ME. MISS JODY,

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:45.168
WHO IS MARRIED TO SOMEONE WHO

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:47.470
HAS BEEN REPORTED, HAD AN

00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:48.505
ACTIVE ROLE IN THIS MAP MAKING,

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:50.106
AND THAT WOULD BE PAUL MITCHELL.

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:52.475
I FIND THAT TO BE A CONFLICT OF

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.244
INTEREST AND I FIND IT

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.044
DISAPPOINTING. THANK YOU, MR.

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:57.781
LACKEY. WE WILL NOW BE GOING TO

00:56:57.847 --> 00:57:01.451
PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:04.387
NAME, ORGANIZATION, IF ANY, AND

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:09.058
YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL. OKAY.

00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:11.227
SEEING NONE, WE WILL BRING IT

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:13.997
BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS.

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:17.000
MISS DIXON, THANK YOU, MADAM

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:20.503
CHAIR. I WILL BE VOTING NO ON

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:23.239
AC 888, WHICH IS A PROPOSED

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:24.574
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT

00:57:24.641 --> 00:57:26.075
THE VOTERS WILL DECIDE DURING

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:27.577
AN UNNECESSARY UNBUDGETED

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.279
EXPENSIVE SPECIAL ELECTION THIS

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:32.015
DECEMBER. AND WE'VE HEARD ALL

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:34.984
THE REASONS WHY THIS IS A BAD

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.253
IDEA, BUT I'LL SPEAK TO THE

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.354
COST AS WE ARE IN

00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:39.322
APPROPRIATIONS. THIS

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:41.090
UNNECESSARY SPECIAL ELECTION IS

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.926
EXPECTED TO COST CALIFORNIA

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:45.829
TAXPAYERS MORE THAN $230

00:57:45.895 --> 00:57:47.330
MILLION, ACCORDING TO THE

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.965
ORANGE COUNTY REGISTRAR OF

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:50.967
VOTERS IN ORANGE COUNTY ALONE.

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:51.668
THIS SPECIAL ELECTION TO

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:52.969
GERRYMANDER CONGRESSIONAL

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:54.571
DISTRICTS AND SPLIT APART

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:56.206
COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT AND

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.208
IN MY OWN CITY IS ANTICIPATED

00:57:58.274 --> 00:58:02.011
TO COST BETWEEN 11 AND $13

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:04.113
MILLION BY VOTING TO PASS SB

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.050
280 OR ACR EIGHT. EXCUSE ME,

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.284
YOU ARE VOTING TO APPROPRIATE

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.320
FUNDING FOR A COSTLY SPECIAL

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:12.021
ELECTION AT A TIME WHEN

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:13.389
CALIFORNIA FACES PAINFUL BUDGET

00:58:13.456 --> 00:58:16.159
CUTS TO HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION,

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:18.428
HOUSING AND OTHER CRITICAL

00:58:18.494 --> 00:58:20.096
SERVICES. AND I TAKE SPECIAL

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:23.166
NOTE OF THE MISS HICKS, I

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.001
BELIEVE HER NAME, WHO SPOKE

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:26.302
EARLIER. AND I JUST WANT TO

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:28.504
QUOTE FROM HER STATEMENT LAST

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:30.540
MAY, WHEN THE GOVERNOR

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:33.209
ANNOUNCED A CUT TO PLANNED

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:35.378
PARENTHOOD IN THE STATE BUDGET,

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:36.980
AND HER STATEMENT AT THE TIME

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:38.548
WAS, WITH THIS MAY BUDGET

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:40.049
REVISION, GOVERNOR NEWSOM,

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:43.019
GOVERNOR NEWSOM, THE AUTHOR OF

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:45.989
THIS EFFORT TO SPEND $230

00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:48.458
MILLION, IS EFFECTIVELY

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:49.492
DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:50.560
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHILE

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:53.029
I RECALL YOUR COMMENTS WERE

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:54.430
RELATED TO THE CONGRESSIONAL

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:55.999
EFFORTS AND AND THE FEDERAL

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:58.601
BUDGETING, HOWEVER, THIS $230

00:58:58.668 --> 00:59:01.237
MILLION COULD GO A LONG WAY TO

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:02.805
SUPPORT YOUR PLANNED PARENTHOOD

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.307
PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. SO I

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.209
SUGGEST MAYBE YOU ALSO TALK TO

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:08.344
THE GOVERNOR. HE'S SPENDING

00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:09.345
$230 MILLION. I COULD BETTER GO

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:11.547
FOR HEALTH CARE, MENTAL HEALTH,

00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:12.949
HOUSING, HOMELESSNESS, ALL THE

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.717
LONG LIST OF HORRIBLES IN THE

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.486
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YET HE CAN

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:18.788
FIND $230 MILLION OUT OF THE

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:21.591
DEFICIT BASED BUDGET TO FUND

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:22.959
THIS ELECTION. IF YOU WANT TO

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.193
HAVE AN ELECTION, I DON'T

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.262
SUPPORT IT. IT SHOULD BE TIED

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:27.163
INTO ANOTHER ELECTION. THERE'S

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.098
BEEN NO FINANCIAL ANALYSIS. I

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:31.301
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ANYWAY, OF THE

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.335
COST TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:34.237
OR TO COUNTY BUDGETS. NO ONE

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:35.438
HAS TIME TO FIGURE THIS OUT

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:37.073
WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING TO

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.374
COME FROM TO PROVIDE FOR A

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:41.311
STATE, ANOTHER STATE MANDATED

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:43.613
UNFUNDED URGENT ITEM, WHICH IS

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.015
AN ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. I WILL

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:48.451
BE VOTING NO. AND WHEN IT COMES

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:50.520
BEFORE ME AND ASK YOU TO DO THE

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:51.354
SAME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:53.256
THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:54.057
RESPOND? MAY I RESPOND TO THAT?

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:56.192
YES. I JUST WANT TO BE VERY

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:57.427
CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK FACTS

00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:58.227
MATTER. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.029
WAS TO CUT THAT FUNDING. THE

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.230
LEGISLATURE REJECTED THOSE CUTS,

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:02.332
AND THE FINAL ADOPTED BUDGET

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:03.166
RESTORED ALL OF THAT FUNDING

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:04.434
FOR HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.468
FUNDING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD,

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:07.570
SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:08.071
CALIFORNIA PAYS OVER $80

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.372
BILLION IN FEDERAL TAXES, THAT

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.341
WE DON'T GET BACK. 70 BILLION

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:13.009
OF THAT WENT TO TEXAS. THAT'S

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:14.243
MONEY THAT IS ALSO BEING CUT

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:16.679
FROM HEAD START PROGRAMS,

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:17.246
EDUCATION PROGRAMS, VETERANS

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:18.548
BENEFITS. AND I FIND IT

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.350
HORRIBLY OFFENSIVE THAT $40

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.018
BILLION OF OUR OWN MONEY

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.252
COULDN'T RETURN HOME FOR

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.288
DISASTER AID. AND LOS ANGELES.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:26.155
NOT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN IN THIS

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:27.423
LEGISLATURE IS DEMANDING THAT

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.258
IT COME HOME. SO IF WE'RE

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:30.059
TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF A

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.227
SPECIAL ELECTION VERSUS THE

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:33.463
COST OF OUR DEMOCRACY, OR THE

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:34.230
COST THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.598
ALREADY PAYING TO SUBSIDIZE

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:36.299
THIS CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION,

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:38.334
THOSE COSTS SEEM WELL WORTH

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:40.003
PAYING IN THIS MOMENT. I JUST

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.337
RESPOND TO THAT. YES. JUST

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:43.773
BRIEFLY. IT'S STILL $230

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.476
MILLION IS NOTHING TO BLINK

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:48.244
YOUR EYES ABOUT. IT IS MONEY

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.512
THAT COULD COST COULD BE

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.381
ALLOCATED FOR COSTS OTHER THAN

01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:53.149
A SPECIAL ELECTION. IF IT SITS

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:55.218
THERE IN THE BUDGET, WHY NOT

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:56.953
PUT IT TO HEALTH CARE? WHY NOT

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.287
PUT IT TO ALL THESE ISSUES THAT

01:00:58.354 --> 01:00:59.455
ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:01.557
CALIFORNIA, BUT SUDDENLY $230

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.026
MILLION MATERIALIZES AS

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:05.928
ESSENTIAL. DEMOCRACY IS NOT

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:08.531
HANGING BY AN EDGE. I THINK

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:09.799
THIS IS REALLY OVERSTATED AND

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:11.034
IT'S HYPERBOLIC, AND IT DOES

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.636
NOT DO A RESPECTABLE SERVICE TO

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:14.470
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.505
ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.206
HYPERBOLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:18.374
THE LAST THING I WILL SAY TO

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.243
THAT IS JUST I WISH WE HAD THE

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:21.944
SAME CONVERSATION WHEN WE RAN

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.179
SEVERAL POINTLESS RECALLS IN

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:24.080
THE LAST FEW YEARS. THANK YOU.

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:26.182
AND WE'LL GO TO MR. TUNG NOW.

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:27.450
AND REMEMBER, EACH MEMBER HAS

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.452
FIVE MINUTES TO OPINE ON THIS

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.621
BILL. THANK YOU AND GOOD

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.022
MORNING. I'VE GOT SOME REALLY

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.158
FISCAL RELATED QUESTIONS. IF IS

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:37.026
THERE ANYBODY POINTED TO THAT I

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:39.128
CAN YEAH I'M READY. OKAY.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.963
YESTERDAY THERE WAS A LAWSUIT

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.331
FILED IN RESPONSE TO THE

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.866
PENDING LEGISLATION. THERE WILL

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.168
BE UNDOUBTEDLY ADDITIONAL

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:46.169
LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:46.969
CALIFORNIA. THE ATTORNEY

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.205
GENERAL HAS ALREADY NEEDED TO

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:50.673
REQUEST EMERGENCY FUNDING TO

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.974
PAY FOR THE LITIGATION. DO YOU

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.242
ANTICIPATE NEEDING TO COME BACK

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:54.944
AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:58.181
FOR THE LITIGATION? AND IF SO,

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.048
DO YOU EXPECT THAT IN THIS

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:01.050
NORMAL BUDGET YEAR OR BUDGET

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.286
CYCLE, OR IS IT GOING TO BE AN

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.121
EMERGENCY ASK? I THINK SIMILAR

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.090
TO THE FUNDS WE GAVE TO THE

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.191
ATTORNEY GENERAL DURING THE

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:08.991
SPECIAL SESSION AT THE

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.093
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR THAT

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.160
HAVE RETURNED BILLIONS OF

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.261
DOLLARS BACK TO CALIFORNIA AT

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.130
THE EXPENSE OF ONLY $50 MILLION

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:14.997
INVESTMENT INVESTMENTS THAT WE

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.332
SPEND PROTECTING OURSELVES FROM

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.366
THIS HOSTILE ADMINISTRATION PAY

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.435
BACK SEVERAL TIMES OVER. SO YOU

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:21.337
YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT FUNDING

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.072
WILL BE USED IN THE LAWSUITS TO

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.240
FIGHT THIS? AND I BELIEVE

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.374
ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE GOING TO

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:26.976
BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS THAT. I

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.111
BELIEVE THAT THE ATTORNEY

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:29.378
GENERAL'S OFFICE, BOTH NOW AND

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.613
UNDER THE PREVIOUS TRUMP

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.914
ADMINISTRATION, HAS BEEN WILDLY

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:33.082
SUCCESSFUL FIGHTING THE

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:34.717
UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THAT.

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:36.119
I'M ASKING FOR THE FUNDS. MAY I

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.154
FINISH TALKING? I'VE ONLY GOT

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:39.322
FIVE MINUTES, SO I'M ASKING FOR

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:41.757
THE FUNDS. I'M NOT ASKING HOW

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:42.358
GOOD THEY ARE. IF YOU CAN LET

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.694
HIM RESPOND, THAT'D BE GREAT.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.194
RECLAIMING MY TIME. FIVE

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.229
MINUTES. I THINK WE'RE ON THE

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.397
OPPOSITE ENDS I HAVE TO RECLAIM.

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.232
I JUST NEED THE FUNDS PORTION.

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:51.167
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.435
GOING TO BE A BUDGET? ASK NOW

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.036
OR LATER. I BELIEVE THAT ANY

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.171
INVESTMENT WE MAKE IN THE

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:56.305
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:57.406
YIELDS BACK SEVERAL TIMES OVER.

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:58.407
MORE RESOURCES BACK TO

01:02:58.474 --> 01:02:59.242
CALIFORNIA. I'M NOT TALKING

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:01.277
ABOUT HOW GOOD THEY ARE. I'M

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:02.345
TALKING ABOUT, DO THEY NEED

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:04.046
MORE MONEY? MR. I THINK HE'S

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.448
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. OKAY.

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:06.249
NEXT QUESTION PLEASE. WILL

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:08.417
LITIGATION COSTS BE TRACKED AND

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:09.085
REPORTED SEPARATELY SO

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.353
TAXPAYERS CAN SEE THE TRUE COST

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:12.021
OF THIS MEASURE? I THINK ANY

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:14.190
TIME THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:15.391
SPENT, IT IS ALWAYS IN A

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.893
TRANSPARENT WAY. AND THE

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:17.793
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.162
BEEN INCREDIBLY TRANSPARENT IN

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:20.463
HOW THEY USE THOSE LITIGATION

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:21.230
DOLLARS TO FIGHT TO RETURN

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.199
DOLLARS BACK TO CALIFORNIA.

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:24.300
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THIS

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:26.435
SPECIAL ELECTION WILL COST $235

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:27.537
MILLION TO COMPLETE. IS THE

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.605
APPROPRIATION FOR THE SPECIAL

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:30.206
ELECTION ULTIMATELY GOING TO

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:33.309
COME FROM THE GENERAL FUND? ALL

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:34.544
WHILE THE LAO HAS ALREADY

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.078
HIGHLIGHTED TO US STRUCTURAL

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.981
DEFICITS AND A PROJECTED BUDGET

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:42.718
SHORTFALL NEXT YEAR, RANGING IN

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:43.853
BETWEEN 10 AND $30 BILLION, I

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.055
CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT GOING TO

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.023
COME FROM THE $80 BILLION THAT

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:48.558
CALIFORNIANS PAY TO SUBSIDIZE

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:49.358
THIS CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:50.493
THAT HAS BEEN HELD HOSTAGE FROM

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.361
THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. THE

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.163
RURAL COUNTIES I REPRESENT ARE

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:56.265
FEELING HEAVY BUDGET PRESSURE.

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.267
OUR COUNTIES CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.670
FOOT. THE BILL UP FRONT FOR THE

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:01.270
SPECIAL ELECTION. IS THE PLAN

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.606
TO PROVIDE THEM FULL UPFRONT

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.107
COSTS OF THE ELECTION, OR ARE

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:08.277
WE GOING TO REIMBURSE THEM

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:08.778
POST-ELECTION? I IMAGINE

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.046
THERE'S A LOT OF ECONOMIC

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:11.347
INSECURITY IN RURAL COUNTIES,

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.348
ESPECIALLY WHEN $100 BILLION

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:13.583
HAS GONE INTO ICE ENFORCEMENT

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:15.351
THAT HAS DESTABILIZED OUR

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:16.252
AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY AND MANY

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:18.421
SECTORS OF OUR STATE. I THINK

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:19.021
THOSE RESOURCES COULD

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:20.156
DEFINITELY BE SPENT IN A BETTER

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:22.358
WAY. ISAAC, I'VE GOT A RURAL

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.292
COUNTY THAT HAS THREE PEOPLE

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.260
THAT WORK FOR BRIAN. SIR,

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:26.162
PLEASE REFER TO HIM BY

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:26.896
ASSEMBLYMAN BRIAN, PLEASE. OR

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.130
THE MEMBER FROM LOS ANGELES.

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.265
SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'M STILL

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:32.134
LEARNING, I KNOW. THE STATE HAS

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.237
A LONG HISTORY, REALLY, OF

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:36.205
CREATING MANDATES THAT ARE

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.106
SUPPOSED TO BE FUNDED. MY BIG

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:40.276
WORRY ON THIS IS THAT THERE'S

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:41.944
SO MANY UNFUNDED MANDATES AND

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.346
MONEY ACTUALLY DOESN'T GET BACK

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:45.281
TO THEM. WHAT GUARANTEES DO WE

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.116
PROVIDE THAT THAT TO MAKE SURE

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:49.619
THAT THIS WON'T HAPPEN? SO

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:50.486
THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE TRYING

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:53.122
TO OPERATE IN THE STATE OF

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.523
CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:56.125
THEY'RE MADE WHOLE, THE ONLY

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.326
MONEY THAT'S NOT GETTING BACK

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:59.028
TO US, NOT TO THE FIRE TORN

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:00.263
AREAS OF LOS ANGELES, NOT TO

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:02.198
OUR HEAD START PROGRAMS, NOT TO

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.133
OUR HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE,

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:04.767
NOT TO OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.135
IT'S THE $80 BILLION IN FEDERAL

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:07.403
TAXES THAT WE PAID, THAT WE

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:08.437
HAVE ASKED FOR BACK IN

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.205
EMERGENCY TIMES THAT THE

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:11.674
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS USED AS

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:12.275
LEVERAGE AND HELD HOSTAGE AND

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:13.109
SUBSIDIZED THEIR PLANS,

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.243
INCLUDING THE PLANS THAT ARE

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:16.212
HAPPENING IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW. I

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:17.446
THINK IT'S SAD RIGHT NOW THAT

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.015
I'M ASKING VERY FISCALLY

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:20.116
APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS IN THE

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.350
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, AND I

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.085
HAVEN'T GOTTEN A SINGLE ANSWER

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.121
ON HOW THE MONEY IS GOING TO

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:26.355
GET THERE, HOW MUCH MONEY IS

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.456
ACTUALLY NEEDED, AND WHERE ARE

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:29.125
THE COST ESTIMATES. ALL I'M

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.993
ASKING FOR IS, CAN WE DO THIS

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.095
AND DO WE HAVE FUNDS WITH A

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:35.197
PROJECTED DEFICIT NEXT YEAR? SO

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.098
WE'RE SAYING AND SORRY, WE ALSO

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:38.134
HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HERE

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.202
WHO CAN WEIGH IN AS WELL. THANK

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.304
YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND GOOD

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:42.872
MORNING. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS.

01:05:42.938 --> 01:05:44.273
MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN BELTRAN.

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.041
I'M WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.409
FINANCE. AND THANK YOU,

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:47.076
ASSEMBLYMEMBER, FOR THE

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.678
QUESTIONS. JUST TO CLARIFY, THE

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:49.312
LANGUAGE DOES SPECIFY THAT THE

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:50.279
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:52.081
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.249
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE, AS

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:54.684
WELL AS OUR COUNTY PARTNERS, TO

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:56.118
ENSURE THAT FUNDING FOR THIS

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:57.353
ELECTION WILL BE MADE IN

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.921
ADVANCE TO THE ELECTION. SO WE

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:00.189
WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.190
COUNTIES, PARTICULARLY OR

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.992
COUNTIES AS WELL, WILL BE MADE

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.226
WHOLE AND NOT HAVE TO CUT ANY

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:05.461
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PUBLIC

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:06.962
SAFETY PROGRAMS OR ANY OTHER

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.064
KIND OF HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.198
DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:10.700
NEXT YEAR ALSO EXPECT AN

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.034
ESTIMATED AND AGREE WITH THE

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.170
LAO'S ANALYSIS THAT THERE'S A

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:15.304
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT NEXT YEAR? I

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:17.239
THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:19.275
ARE NOT IN THE BEST BUDGET

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:20.109
SITUATION, GIVEN FEDERAL

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:21.977
PRESSURES AND GIVEN OTHER KIND

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:24.313
OF HOSTILE ACTS THAT WE ARE

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.781
SEEING FROM THE FEDERAL

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:26.482
GOVERNMENT, AND THEREFORE WE

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.117
ARE CONTINUING TO PLAN FOR THE

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:29.051
WORST. AND WE DO HAVE

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:30.553
PROJECTIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.755
WITH THE LAO. HOWEVER, WE WOULD

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:33.456
JUST ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:34.223
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.424
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.226
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:38.394
PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE BOTH ON

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:39.462
THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS,

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:41.497
TO ENSURE WE ARE CONTINUING TO

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:42.665
GET AS MUCH FUNDING AS POSSIBLE.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.266
AND SORRY, YOUR FIVE MINUTES IS

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.669
UP. THIS IS YOUR LAST QUESTION.

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.037
OKAY. WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:50.106
MANY QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.574
ANSWERED BECAUSE IT'S FISCALLY

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.109
RESPONSIBLE. HERE IN THE STATE

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.243
OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE ELECTED

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.479
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.280
GET OUR BUDGET RIGHT. THAT IS

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.249
NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. WE

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:02.184
KNOW THAT, BUT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.620
SURE THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.521
HERE, BECAUSE THAT WAS MY FIRST

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:06.355
QUESTION. WHO SHOULD I APPOINT

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.190
THE FINANCIAL QUESTIONS TO? AND

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:09.425
YOU SAID YOU WERE READY. IT

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.227
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT. BUT WHAT

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:13.362
WE NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW IS

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:16.065
WHO DREW THE MAPS, WHO GOT PAID,

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.434
WHO DIDN'T GO ON VACATION, WHO

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.704
IS INVOLVED IN THIS, AND WHO

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:22.905
HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN ALL OF

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:24.440
THIS MONEY BEING ALLOCATED?

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:26.308
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. THAT IS

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.843
THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.412
EVERYBODY IS ASKING. CAN

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:30.913
SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY, ANYBODY

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.349
TELL US DEFINITIVELY WHETHER

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.151
IT'S LEADERSHIP, WHETHER IT'S

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.519
THE DCC, WHETHER IT'S PAUL

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:37.953
MITCHELL, WHETHER IT'S SPECIAL

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.322
INTERESTS WHO GOT PAID TO DRAW

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:43.025
THE MAPS AND WHO IS DOING THIS?

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:44.860
AND DID THEY REGISTER UNDER THE

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.395
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:47.530
SURE THAT THEY CAN DO THIS?

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:49.265
ANSWER THE QUESTION. MR. BRIAN,

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.599
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT?

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.134
AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO OTHER

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.402
MEMBERS? SURE. I'M HAPPY TO,

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:54.837
AND I APPRECIATE YOU STILL

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:55.438
LEARNING WHICH COMMITTEE DOES

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:57.173
WHAT, BECAUSE YOU STARTED OUT

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.240
UNDERSTANDING THIS IS A FISCAL

01:07:58.307 --> 01:07:59.108
COMMITTEE AND THEN WENT

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:00.209
STRAIGHT INTO YOUR PARTIZAN BS,

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:01.744
AND THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.712
THESE MAPS WERE DRAWN UP IN

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.014
COLLABORATION BETWEEN MANY

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.182
STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING EXPERTS

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:08.651
WHO HAVE BEEN DRAWING LINES FOR

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:09.452
MULTIPLE MUNICIPALITIES FOR

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.353
OVER 100 DIFFERENT

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.521
JURISDICTIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.089
AND BEYOND. IT WAS IN

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:14.557
COLLABORATION WITH THE

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.291
LEGISLATURE, THOSE MANY

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:17.259
INDIVIDUALS AND HOW MUCH DID

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:18.527
THEY GET PAID? WE'RE ALLOWING

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:21.230
MR. ISAAC BRIAN TO. IT WAS ALSO

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:22.364
IN COLLABORATION WITH THE

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.467
10,000 COMMENTS THAT WERE

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:25.234
SUBMITTED TO THE INDEPENDENT

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:25.868
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION, WHICH

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.170
IS WHY NEARLY 80% OF THIS MAP

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:30.339
MIRRORS THE MAP BEFORE. LET'S

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.974
ALSO BE VERY CLEAR. THE PERSON

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:34.176
WHO DREW THIS MAP IS THE

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.244
AUTHORITARIAN IN THE WHITE

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:36.045
HOUSE WHO CALLED FOR

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:37.313
DESTRUCTION OF THE FOUNDATIONS

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:39.215
OF OUR DEMOCRACY BY CLAWING

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.483
BACK FIVE SEATS THAT DON'T

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:42.084
BELONG TO HIM IN TEXAS AND

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:43.252
FORCING THE PEOPLE OF

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.253
CALIFORNIA TO RESPOND. THE

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.088
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WILL DRAW

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.289
THIS MAP ON NOVEMBER WHEN THEY

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.325
HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. THE

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:50.192
LEGISLATURE DOES NOT DRAW OR

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:52.261
IMPLEMENT THESE MAPS. THE

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.229
PEOPLE GET THE FINAL VOICE AND

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.264
THE MAPS WILL CHANGE. NOT EVEN

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:56.966
A LITTLE BIT UNLESS THEY SAY SO

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.167
IN NOVEMBER, AND I BELIEVE

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.535
STRONGLY THAT THEY WILL. BUT WE

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:01.403
SHOULD KNOW WHO PAID TO PREPARE

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.171
YOU, BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE GOT.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.073
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. OKAY.

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:05.140
STILL LEARNING THOSE RULES. ANY

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.243
OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:11.981
MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE? MR.

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:14.250
GONZALEZ, I KNOW THERE'S A LOT

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:15.417
OF CONVERSATION ABOUT COST, AND

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.253
I THINK THE BUDGET FIGURES WERE

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.955
100 AND SOMETHING. WHAT WAS IT,

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:21.290
$230 MILLION TO TAXPAYERS TO

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:22.525
HAVE THE SPECIAL ELECTION? BUT

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.159
I JUST WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION

01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:25.394
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE,

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.563
IF THEY CAN CONFIRM FROM MANY

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:28.397
STUDIES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:29.965
SAY FROM MASS ARRESTS,

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.433
DETENTIONS AND DEPORTATIONS IN

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.535
CALIFORNIA COULD COST THE

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:35.004
STATE'S ECONOMY $275 BILLION

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:37.206
AND ELIMINATE $23 BILLION IN

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:39.441
ANNUAL TAX REVENUE. THE LOSS OF

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:40.876
IMMIGRANT WORKERS, INCLUDING

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:41.443
UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS AND

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.945
THOSE LOSING LAWFUL STATUS,

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:44.280
WOULD HINDER PROJECTS LIKE

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.915
REBUILDING LOS ANGELES AFTER

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:47.983
WILDFIRES, REDUCING FOOD SUPPLY

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.418
AND INCREASING COSTS. AND IN

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:50.819
2020, TWO, UNDOCUMENTED

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:53.522
IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTED $8.5

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.224
BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:56.959
TAXES, A FIGURE THAT WOULD RISE

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.161
TO 10.3 BILLION IF THEY COULD

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:00.996
WORK LAWFULLY. SO IF WE'RE

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:03.165
SITTING HERE ARGUING ABOUT $230

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:04.833
MILLION, I WISH THERE WAS THIS

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.135
SORT OF OUTRAGE WHEN IT CAME TO

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.236
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:09.405
ARE BEING LOST AS A RESULT OF

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:11.674
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME, WHO

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.542
ARE BEING DETAINED, WERE BEING

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:15.210
HELD HOSTAGE. AND WE'RE SITTING

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.179
HERE ARGUING ABOUT, WELL, WHO

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:19.415
DREW THE MAPS? WHO HELD THE PEN?

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:21.083
WELL, GUESS WHAT? THE

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.619
CALIFORNIA, WE WERE THE ONES

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:25.220
WHO WENT OUT THERE, AND WE WERE

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:26.221
THE ONES WHO SAID THAT WE'RE,

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:28.290
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE OBSESSING OVER

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.158
WHO WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:31.226
STRUCTURE AND HOW THEY DID IT.

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.962
THE PUBLIC DID IT. AND IN THE

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:34.496
IN THE COMMENTS THAT WERE

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:35.431
MENTIONED, IT SAID ABANDONING

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:37.032
PRINCIPLES, FAIR REPRESENTATION,

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:41.604
MASS POWER, GRAB LOSING WHEN

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:42.237
POLITICIANS. I'M FROM TEXAS. I

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:44.006
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS THERE AND

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.008
THEY ARE NOT LISTENING TO THE

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.142
PEOPLE. THEY'RE HOLDING THEM

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:48.210
HOSTAGE. IN FACT, THEIR OWN

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.311
LEGISLATURE IS STUCK THERE AND

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.046
THEY CAN ONLY GET A POLICE

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:52.147
ESCORT. SO THERE'S ALL THIS

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:53.415
TALK AND RHETORIC ABOUT, OH,

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:55.017
YOU KNOW, WHO'S DRAWING THE

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.218
MAPS AND HOW ARE THEY DOING

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:57.419
THIS? AND REPUBLICANS IN TEXAS

01:10:57.486 --> 01:10:59.188
AND FLORIDA AND ACROSS THE

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:00.089
COUNTRY ARE ACTIVELY RIGGING

01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:02.458
DISTRICTS TO SILENCE VOTERS AND

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:03.959
PROTECT DONALD TRUMP. BUT WE'RE

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.194
FIGURING OUT WHERE ALL THIS

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.395
MONEY IS COMING FROM. WHILE

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.197
IMMIGRANTS WHO MAKE US THE

01:11:08.263 --> 01:11:09.031
FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.165
WORLD ARE SUFFERING. SO THE

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:12.434
QUESTION IS, IF YOU CAN CONFIRM

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.003
THAT AS A RESULT OF THESE RAIDS

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:17.473
AND ALL OF THE THE HOSTAGES

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:18.273
THAT ARE BEING TAKEN BY THIS

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.808
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHO ARE

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.343
TAKING BROWN PEOPLE, THE

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.344
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT IT'S

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.178
COSTING CALIFORNIA, AND WHY WE

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.948
HAVE TO HAVE THIS ELECTION IN

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:27.082
THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU,

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:28.050
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ, AND

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.252
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. YOU

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:32.054
KNOW, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.156
THAT WE, AS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:35.457
FINANCE, CONTINUE TO TRACK THE

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:36.091
ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS THAT ARE

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:37.259
STEMMING FROM THE FEDERAL

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.360
GOVERNMENT, WHETHER IT'S

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:39.395
THROUGH TARIFF POLICY OR

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:39.962
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. WE

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:41.964
CONTINUE TO TRACK OUR MONTHLY

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:43.232
CASH RECEIPTS, AND WE'LL

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:45.300
CONTINUE TO DO SO AND BE ABLE

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:46.168
TO REPORT THAT TO THE

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:47.269
LEGISLATURE AS WE HAVE MORE

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:49.104
INFORMATION. THANK YOU. DO WE

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:51.073
HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. I

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.332
HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MY TWO

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:19.201
COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE ON THE

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:21.270
DAIS, BUT I'M GOING TO START

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:23.005
WITH A BIT OF BEING A FANBOY.

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:25.541
HAVING WATCHED SO MANY OF THE

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:26.075
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.143
COMMISSIONS. TRINA, YOU WERE

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:30.212
OUR CENTRAL VALLEY

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:31.480
REPRESENTATIVE. YOU STOOD UP

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:33.182
FOR US. I WATCHED YOU TIME AND

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:34.283
TIME AGAIN DURING THOSE

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:35.718
HEARINGS, MAKING SURE THAT YOU

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.119
WERE STANDING UP FOR COMMUNITY

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.254
AND PROTECTING US. AND SO I

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:42.057
WANT TO ASK, WITH ALL REAL

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:43.926
HONESTY, WHY WE NEED TO REPEAT

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:46.095
THIS PROCESS THAT WAS SO WELL

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:48.230
DONE BACK THERE JUST A FEW

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:50.199
YEARS AGO. CAN YOU HELP ANSWER

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.367
THAT TO ME? BECAUSE I STARTED

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:53.569
MY WEEK MEETING WITH MY

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:55.604
PREACHER, MEETING WITH MY FAITH

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.773
LEADERS, WANTING TO BE LED IN

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.175
THIS MOMENT, KNOWING THAT IT'S

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:02.044
IMPORTANT FOR US TO STAND UP

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:02.911
FOR PEOPLE OF OUR GREAT STATE.

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.246
YES, AND THANK YOU FOR THE

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:06.615
QUESTION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.517
RESPOND. I THINK MOST OF WHAT

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:10.352
WE HEAR TALKS ABOUT NUMBERS,

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:13.255
FIGURES, POLICY. THERE IS AN

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:16.058
OLD SAYING IN THE CHURCH THAT

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.292
TALKS ABOUT WARNS PEOPLE

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:19.194
AGAINST BEING SO HEAVENLY

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.496
MINDED THAT YOU'RE NO EARTHLY

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.766
GOOD. AND IN THIS CASE, I THINK

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:24.533
IN ALL OF OUR APPROPRIATION

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.201
MEETINGS, WE NEED TO THINK

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.269
ABOUT BEING SO POLITICALLY

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:29.271
MINDED THAT WE'RE NO COMMUNITY.

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:31.206
GOOD PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AS A

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:33.308
RESULT OF WHAT'S ALREADY GOING

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.110
ON. AND IT'S ONE THING TO STAND

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.845
ON POLICY AND PRINCIPLE WHEN

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:37.479
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:38.514
NON-THREATENED COMMUNITIES TO

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.116
GO HOME TO. BUT FOR OUR CENTRAL

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.684
VALLEY COMMUNITIES AND OTHER

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.952
PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:46.321
SEEN RIGHT NOW TERROR ON THE

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.623
STREETS, SEPARATIONS OF

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:50.125
FAMILIES, OVERREACH BY OUR

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:51.059
ADMINISTRATION. WE CANNOT WAIT

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:53.095
FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS, SIX

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:55.297
YEARS, TEN YEARS. WE NEED TO

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:56.131
TAKE ACTION NOW. AND WHEN

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:58.200
HISTORY IS TOLD, WE NEED TO BE

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.302
ABLE TO SAY THAT WE STOOD ON

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.704
THE RIGHT SIDE OF TRYING TO

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:03.205
STOP THIS AUTHORITARIAN

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.274
GOVERNMENT THAT WE HAVE

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.142
CURRENTLY GOING ON. NUMBERS 230

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:09.411
MILLION IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY.

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:10.279
WE CAN FIND IT, AND CERTAINLY

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:12.247
IT CAN BE OFFSET BY SOME OF THE

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.282
OTHER THINGS THAT'S CURRENTLY

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:15.184
GOING ON. I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.085
THAT. I'M AN EXPERT IN FACING

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.387
PEOPLE ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:20.122
THAT'S LIVING IN REAL FEAR. AND

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.057
WE STILL WILL HAVE A FIGHT

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.292
BECAUSE THEIR VOICES ARE

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.093
INTENTIONALLY BEING MUTED NOW

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.628
SO THEY DON'T SHOW UP LATER.

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.063
THE PEOPLE WILL SPEAK IF

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.532
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SPEAK. IF WE

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.768
DON'T CONTINUE TO FACE ISSUES

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:34.469
LIKE TRYING TO GET RID OF

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.171
VOTING BY MAIL, GETTING RID OF

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:37.973
THE BAIL, ALL OF THAT IS A ONE

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.241
STORY, ONE PICTURE DESIGNED TO

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.410
SILENCE VOICES. IF THE CONGRESS

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:44.146
DIDN'T STAND UP AGAINST OUR

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:45.981
ADMINISTRATION AND FACE THAT

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:48.116
AND SPEAK OUT AGAINST IT, AND

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:49.251
WE EXPECT PEOPLE TO DO IT

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.953
WITHOUT ANY COVER AND

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.187
PROTECTION, I'M HOPING THAT ALL

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:54.256
OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.190
DO WHAT OUR PEOPLE IS COUNTING

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.559
ON YOU TO DO, AND YOU KNOW THAT

01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:58.427
THEY'RE BEING IMPACTED NOW BY

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:01.096
WHAT'S GOING ON. THANK YOU FOR

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.364
THAT ANSWER. AND THANK YOU FOR

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:04.366
BEING ABLE TO ASK THAT QUESTION.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.869
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.971
HAVE QUESTIONS? MR. BRYAN,

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:11.206
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE?

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:12.374
ABSOLUTELY. I'D LIKE TO JUST

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:14.276
ADDRESS, FINALLY A FEW THINGS

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:17.412
THAT HAD BEEN SAID. OPPOSITION

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:20.148
WITNESS MY COLLEAGUE SAID THAT

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:21.683
STEALING CONGRESSIONAL SEATS IS

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.118
THE MOST BRAZEN WAY TO RIG THE

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.654
SYSTEM. I COULD NOT AGREE MORE.

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:28.056
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY, IN THIS

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:29.458
MOMENT, WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:30.893
PUSH BACK AGAINST THE POWER

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:33.128
GRAB THAT IS HAPPENING FROM THE

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.129
AUTHORITARIAN IN THE WHITE

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:35.264
HOUSE THROUGH THE STATE OF

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:37.132
TEXAS. MY COLLEAGUE ALSO SAID

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.400
THAT TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:40.936
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:41.503
LEGISLATURE SHOULD DRAW AN

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:45.140
IMPLEMENT. NEW MAPS. I AGREE,

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:46.174
THAT'S WHY I AUTHORED

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.743
LEGISLATION TWO YEARS AGO

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:48.877
CALLING FOR INDEPENDENT

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:49.945
REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS AT

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.346
EVERY LEVEL OF CALIFORNIA

01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:52.748
GOVERNMENT, AND IT WAS OPPOSED

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.082
BY EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN,

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:55.083
INCLUDING THE GENTLEMAN WHO I

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:56.451
LOVE, WHO IS SITTING RIGHT NEXT

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:58.487
TO ME. THAT'S WHY I ALSO PASSED

01:15:58.553 --> 01:16:00.188
AN UPDATE TO THE FAIR MAPS ACT

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:02.591
THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:03.158
GOVERNMENT THAT PREVENTED US

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.660
FROM DRAWING MAPS AROUND

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:05.294
INCUMBENCY. AGAIN, IT WAS VOTED

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.362
DOWN BY EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:08.130
IN THE LEGISLATURE. IN FACT,

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:11.934
THE LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:12.534
CAUCUS SPOKE IN OPPOSITION. OR

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:15.938
THE REPUBLICAN, THE MR.

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:19.174
GALLAGHER SPOKE IN OPPOSITION.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:20.142
THE PUBLIC IN THIS MOMENT

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:22.210
DOESN'T WANT US TO BOW DOWN AND

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:24.179
ROLL OVER AND ALLOW FOR THE

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:25.013
FOUNDATIONS OF OUR DEMOCRACY TO

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.082
BE ERODED AND TAKEN AWAY FROM

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:28.317
US SO THAT OUR COUNTRY BECOMES

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:30.018
NO LONGER RECOGNIZABLE. I ALSO

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:32.387
THINK THE FISCAL HYPOCRISY THAT

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:33.422
I'VE HEARD TODAY IS MIND

01:16:33.488 --> 01:16:35.290
BLOWING. THE STATE OF

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:36.558
CALIFORNIA WAS IMPACTED BY OVER

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.360
$10 BILLION FROM THE HAPHAZARD

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.028
TARIFFS THAT WERE COMING OUT OF

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.363
WASHINGTON, DC. THE GOVERNOR

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.298
SPOKE VERY CLEARLY ABOUT IT IN

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:45.067
THE MAY REVISE. I'VE SAID IT

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:46.301
MANY TIMES TO THIS HEARING

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:47.235
ALREADY. THE STATE OF

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:48.036
CALIFORNIA PAYS OVER $80

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.171
BILLION IN FEDERAL TAXES, THAT

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:51.640
WE DO NOT GET BACK MONEY THAT

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:54.309
LOS ANGELES WAS ON FIRE IN

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:55.277
JANUARY HAS DESPERATELY ASKED

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:57.546
FOR IN FEDERAL AID. WE HAVE A

01:16:57.612 --> 01:16:59.247
$1 BILLION EXTORTION ATTEMPT ON

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:00.282
THE NUMBER ONE PUBLIC

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.050
UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY, UCLA.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.518
AND I DON'T HEAR ANY

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:04.219
REPUBLICANS STANDING UP FOR

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.088
THOSE CALIFORNIA TAX DOLLARS. I

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:07.189
DIDN'T HEAR ANY REPUBLICANS

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:08.290
STANDING UP TO THE BIG,

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:09.458
BEAUTIFUL SCAM THAT PUT

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:10.625
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.461
NATIONAL DEBT ON THE BACKS OF

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:13.362
THE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF

01:17:13.428 --> 01:17:14.396
CALIFORNIA CHILDREN, AND CUT

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.031
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CRITICAL

01:17:16.098 --> 01:17:17.399
SERVICES, BENEFITS, NUTRITIONAL

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.668
ASSISTANCE, AND THE THINGS THAT

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:20.435
OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES NEED

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:22.237
TO SURVIVE. SO TO SIT HERE AND

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.338
TALK ABOUT THE COST OF A

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:24.139
SPECIAL ELECTION TO SAVE

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:27.275
DEMOCRACY, BEING TOO HIGH IS

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:28.477
UNCONSCIONABLE, HYPOCRITICAL

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:31.146
AND UNBECOMING OF ANYBODY IN

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:32.180
THIS BODY. THE PEOPLE OF

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:34.082
CALIFORNIA HAVE ASKED FOR US TO

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.250
STAND UP. THAT IS WHY WE ARE

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:37.586
MOVING THIS FORWARD. AND I

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:38.186

SECONDED BY MR. FONG. I ALSO

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.232

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:51.233
COMMENTS AS WELL. I APPRECIATE

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:53.168
THE SPIRITED DEBATE THAT WE

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:55.404
HAVE HAD HERE IN THE

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:56.071
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. I

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.339

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.615
HER POSITION AS A LEADER OF

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:07.949
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND NOT AS

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.284
THE WIFE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.119
PARTICIPATED IN THIS. AND SHE

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:12.320
IS A PROFESSIONAL IN HER OWN

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:13.488
RIGHT WHO IS LEADING AN

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.457
ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES VERY

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:16.158
CRITICAL SERVICES FOR MILLIONS

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:17.426
OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.094
CALIFORNIA. AND THAT IS WHO SHE

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.228
IS HERE REPRESENTING. PLANNED

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:21.496
PARENTHOOD IS AN ORGANIZATION

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:22.998
THAT I HAVE BENEFITED FROM

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.299
MYSELF WHEN I DID NOT HAVE

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.234
HEALTH CARE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:28.470
AND SHE HAS EVERY ABILITY TO BE

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:29.304
HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:31.039
THOSE WHO NEED THOSE RESOURCES.

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:34.209
SO I JUST WANT TO RESPECTFULLY

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:36.111
REMIND US WHY SHE IS HERE, IN

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.180
WHICH CAPACITY SHE IS HERE. THE

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:40.582
OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:41.149
IS, SINCE THIS IS A FISCAL

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.185
COMMITTEE, YOU KNOW, THE COST

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.986
OF INACTION IS WAY TOO HIGH

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:47.355
RIGHT NOW ON ON WHAT IS BEFORE

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:50.792
US HERE IN THIS BODY. THE COST

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.327
TO OUR DEMOCRACY IS WHAT WE ARE

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.096
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. THE

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:56.131
COST TO FAMILIES, MILLIONS OF

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:57.466
WHOM WHO WILL LOSE HEALTHCARE

01:18:57.532 --> 01:18:59.334
BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS TRUMP

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:00.235
ADMINISTRATION IS DOING. THE

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:01.736
COST TO THESE WILDFIRE VICTIMS

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:04.172
WHO ARE NOT RECEIVING THE THE

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.641
DESERVED RESOURCES THAT THEY

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.076
NEED TO REBUILD THE COST TO OUR

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.478
WORKING CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:11.279
LOSING THEIR SNAP BENEFITS.

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:12.247
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:15.016
ABOUT HERE. NONE OF US WANT TO

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.485
BE IN THIS SITUATION, BUT OUR

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:18.153
HAND IS BEING FORCED AND WE

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.288
WILL NOT UNILATERALLY DISARM.

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:22.023
THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE AND WE

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.925
ARE DOING THIS IN THE MOST

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.293
TRANSPARENT WAY POSSIBLE. BY

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.094
ALLOWING THE ELECTORATE TO

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:28.396
DETERMINE IF THEY WANT, IF THEY

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.432
WANT THIS OR NOT, THIS IS GOING

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.234
TO GO TO THE BALLOT. THERE'S

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.468
TRIGGERS ON THIS. IT REVERTS

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:34.970
BACK TO THE COMMISSION. THIS IS

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.505
THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.206
WHERE WE ARE AT. BUT WE WILL

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:40.075
NOT STOP FIGHTING IN CALIFORNIA.

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.376
AND I BELIEVE OUR ELECTORATE

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.111
WILL RESPOND TO THAT AS WELL.

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:45.180
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE MOVING

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:46.314
FORWARD TODAY. THAT IS WHAT IS

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:48.150
GOING TO BE ON THE FLOOR OF THE

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:49.417
ASSEMBLY FOR DEBATE TOMORROW. I

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:51.286
DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.020
CONVERSATION, BUT WITH THAT, I

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:54.289
AM PROUD TO MOVE THIS BILL

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:55.790
FORWARD. IT IS GOING TO MOVE

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:57.025
OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY ON

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:59.161

THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND

COMMITTEE MEMBERS, TODAY, I AM

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:54.349
PROUD TO PRESENT SENATE BILL

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:56.017
280, WHICH CALLS FOR A

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:58.119
STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTION ON

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:00.322
NOVEMBER 4TH OF THIS YEAR. THE

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:01.590
SPECIAL ELECTION WOULD ALLOW

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:03.725
CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO CONSIDER

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:04.960
ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:07.495
AMENDMENT A, WHICH WOULD ALLOW

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:09.331
THIS LEGISLATURE TO ENGAGE IN A

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.099
ONE TIME MID-DECADE

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.334
REDISTRICTING OF OUR STATE'S

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.070
DISTRICTS. IN THE US HOUSE OF

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:16.271
REPRESENTATIVES. THIS BILL ALSO

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:19.441
MAKES THE NECESSARY STATUTORY

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:22.277
CHANGES TO ALLOW THE JUNE 2026

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.179
STATEWIDE PRIMARY ELECTION TO

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:27.282
BE HELD ON TIME. CALIFORNIA DID

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:29.117
NOT START THIS REDISTRICTING

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.385
FIGHT. THIS FIGHT WAS BROUGHT

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:33.855
TO US. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.991
IS, IF WE LET DONALD TRUMP GET

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.225
AWAY WITH RIGGING ELECTIONS IN

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:40.028
TEXAS AND OTHER RED STATES

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:40.962
THROUGH PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERING,

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:43.198
WE WILL NOT HAVE FREE OR FAIR

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:44.532
ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:47.168
IN THE FUTURE. IF DONALD TRUMP

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:49.004
PURSUES THIS POWER GRAB,

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.840
CALIFORNIA STANDS READY TO

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:54.209
RESPOND. SB 280 APPROPRIATES

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:56.745
THE FUNDING NECESSARY FOR THE

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.613
SECRETARY OF STATE IN OUR

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.315
COUNTY REGISTRARS TO ADMINISTER

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:02.017
THE SPECIAL ELECTION. THE

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:04.419
AMOUNT NEEDED TO ADMINISTER THE

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.320
ELECTION WILL BE DETERMINED BY

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:07.322
THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:08.223
OF FINANCE AND APPROPRIATED

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.325
FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THE

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:12.460
STATE COMPTROLLER WILL THEN

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:14.095
DISTRIBUTE MONIES TO THE SOS

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.463
AND THE COUNTY REGISTRARS SO

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.198
THAT THEY HAVE THE FUNDING THEY

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:21.002
NEED. THIS IS DONE ON THE FRONT

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:22.504
END, SO THE FUNDING IS

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:25.640
AVAILABLE AS THE AS WE MARCH

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:28.510
TOWARD THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER.

01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:30.078
MADAM CHAIR, WE HAVE TWO

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:31.579

PRESIDENT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.295
AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA. I

A HEALTH CARE ADVOCATE,

PARTICULARLY FOR OUR MOST

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.044
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN

01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:04.446
CALIFORNIA, AND ADVOCATING FOR

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:06.114
PATIENTS ON MEDICAID. SO THAT

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.450
IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY. PLANNED

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:12.053
PARENTHOOD WAS THE FIRST ACTION

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.322
THAT HAPPENED WITH H.R. ONE. SO

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:16.825
THE DEFUND HAPPENED DAY ONE. IT

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:18.460
WAS $300 MILLION. THANK YOU FOR

MAKING CUTS TO PLANNED

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:31.973
PARENTHOOD, TO MEDICAID, TO ANY

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.275
SECTION OF OUR HEALTH CARE THAT

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.778
AFFECTS PATIENTS IN A DEEP WAY,

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.079
WHICH SOME OF OUR OWN

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:40.382
CALIFORNIA BUDGET PROPOSALS DID,

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:43.118
WE HAVE ADVOCATED TO ENSURE

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:45.720
THAT PEOPLE IN OUR MOST

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.188
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE ABLE

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:49.924
TO GET ACCESS TO THE HEALTHCARE

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:51.626
THAT THEY NEED, INCLUDING

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.228
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE. WHAT

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:55.063
H.R. ONE DID, THOUGH, IS

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.165
DECIMATE THAT, AND IT IS $300

01:23:57.232 --> 01:24:01.202
MILLION EVERY YEAR. SO THE COST

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:03.671
AND THE FISCAL ANALYSIS FOR

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:06.040
BEING ABLE TO FIGHT BACK

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:07.308
AGAINST A CONGRESS THAT IS

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:09.310
ATTEMPTING TO HOLD ON TO POWER,

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:12.313
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ECONOMIC

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.982
SANCTIONS AND HOLD CALIFORNIA

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:16.317
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE VALUES THAT

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:18.052
WE ALL SHARE, WHICH INCLUDES

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:20.488
REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, WHICH

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.056
INCLUDES DIVERSITY, INCLUSIVITY

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:25.126
AND EQUITY IN HEALTHCARE HAS TO

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:28.062
BE STOPPED. OUR CONGRESS

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:30.265
MEMBERS NEED TO BE HELD

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:31.132
ACCOUNTABLE. WE WANT TO BE ABLE

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:33.168
TO DO THAT IN THE TRADITIONAL

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:34.969
WAY, BUT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO IF

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.204
OTHER STATES ARE RIGGING THE

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:38.239
SYSTEM. AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:39.607
TODAY, ENCOURAGING YOUR AYE

01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:42.777
VOTE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:46.748
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TRINA

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:48.416
TURNER, 2020 REDISTRICTING

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:50.218
COMMISSIONER. I WANTED TO SAY

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:53.621
THAT IF WE COULD BALANCE A

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:55.089
PERFECT BUDGET, BUT WE DO IT ON

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:57.525
THE BACKS OF PEOPLE WHERE IT

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:58.026
BRINGS THEM HARM. IT IS

01:24:58.092 --> 01:25:00.228
ABSOLUTELY A PROBLEM FOR

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:01.329
CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA CAN'T

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:04.032
BE CENTERED IN THIS MOMENT,

01:25:04.098 --> 01:25:05.366
IRREGARDLESS TO WHAT ELSE IS

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.769
GOING ON IN THE NATION. THE

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:08.536
PROPOSED DISTRICTS AREN'T

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.338
PERFECT, AS THE CURRENT ONES

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:12.006
AREN'T, BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.308
NOT ELICIT THE CRITIQUE AND

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:15.043
FEAR THAT SOME ARE GOING FOR

01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:19.214
THIS COST OF 230 235 MILLION IS

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.083
WELL WORTH THE MONEY SPENT IN

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:24.252
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:25.186
COMMUNITIES. THE NEW MAPS, BY

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:27.655
THE WAY, USE MOST ALL OF THE

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:28.990
SAME CRITERIA, VRA INCLUDED,

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:31.359
AND THE ALMOST 40,000 COMMUNITY

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:33.328
OF INTEREST TESTIMONY RECEIVED.

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:35.530
IT WAS ALL USED. MOST DISTRICTS

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:36.297
THAT WE FOCUSED ON WERE

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:38.399
ACTUALLY KEPT INTACT. THE

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:41.236
PROPOSED MARGIN, THE PROPOSED,

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.037
EVEN THE PROPOSED MAPS EVEN

01:25:43.104 --> 01:25:44.339
MANAGED TO SPLIT FEWER AREAS

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:46.241
AND WE WERE ABLE TO SPLIT.

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:47.609
THERE WERE SOME ISSUES IN THAT,

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:49.077
IN THAT THERE WERE SOME

01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:50.144
COMMUNITIES THAT WERE SPLIT.

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:51.346
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:52.146
BALANCING WHAT'S GOING ON. I'M

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.382
NOT CONFUSED AS A COMMISSIONER

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:56.117
THAT THIS IS IN THIS MOMENT,

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:57.852
NOT ABOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS HAS

01:25:57.919 --> 01:25:59.220
NOTHING TO DO WITH RECANTING OR

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:00.154
FIGURING OUT THAT INDEPENDENT

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.990
REDISTRICTING WAS INCORRECT. IT

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:03.458
WAS GREAT. IT'S WONDERFUL. WE

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:05.426
NEED TO DO IT ACROSS THE NATION.

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:06.194
SINCE THAT'S NOT HAPPENING

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.096
RIGHT NOW. CALIFORNIA, WE NEED

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:10.331
TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP IN THIS

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:12.066
MOMENT AND WE DO NEED TO. I'M

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:14.035
TOTAL SUPPORT OF SB 280 FOR THE

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:16.037
ELECTION THAT NEEDS TO TAKE

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.305
PLACE NOW, BECAUSE I THINK THE

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.007
WORK BEFORE US IS TO GET OUR

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:20.542
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:21.309
CALIFORNIANS, TO UNDERSTAND WHY

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:23.244
WE'RE TAKING THIS APPROACH IN

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:25.079
THIS MOMENT THAT IS DIFFERENT

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:26.714
FROM WHAT WE DID JUST FIVE

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.182
YEARS AGO. THE DAY IS DIFFERENT.

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:30.151
OUR TIME IS DIFFERENT. OUR

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:32.820
NATION IS DIFFERENT. OUR

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:33.221
CONGRESSIONAL, THE

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:34.289
REPRESENTATIVES HAVE NOT STOOD

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.357
UP FOR CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:37.492
NOT VOTED IN A WAY THAT

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:39.227
PROTECTS ALL OF OUR NATION. AND

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:41.563
SO WE NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:42.997
TO PLAY A ROLE IN THAT. THE

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:44.899
LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.367
MANY OF OUR PEOPLE, A LOT OF

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:48.169
TIMES WE HAVE OFTEN SAID

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:49.337
CALIFORNIA WAS NOT A SWING

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:51.072
STATE, SO WE DON'T GET A LOT OF

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:53.207
VOICE UP FRONT. BUT IN THIS

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:54.509
MOMENT, CALIFORNIA IS CENTERED

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:55.376
IN THIS CONVERSATION AND WE

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:57.378
NEED TO STAND UP NOW. SUPPORT

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.480

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.416

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:28.403
MISS DIXON, YOU CAN GO FIRST.

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.138
AND I WANT TO REMIND MEMBERS

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:31.272
THEY WILL EACH HAVE FIVE

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:32.974
MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:34.008
MADAM CHAIR. I DON'T THINK I

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.209
NEED FIVE MINUTES. I WILL BE

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:37.412
VOTING. NO. I WILL BE SAYING

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:39.047
MUCH OF THE SAME THAT I SAID IN

01:28:39.113 --> 01:28:40.481
THE PREVIOUS MEASURE, SB, SB

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:43.017
280, WHICH CALLS FOR A FISCALLY

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:44.252
IRRESPONSIBLE SPECIAL ELECTION

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:47.288
TO BE HELD ON NOVEMBER 4TH SO

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:48.456
VOTERS CAN DETERMINE THE FATE

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:51.259
OF ACR EIGHT. THIS UNNECESSARY.

01:28:51.325 --> 01:28:53.161
AGAIN STATED AGAIN, SPECIAL

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:55.396
ELECTION IS EXPECTED TO COST

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:57.665
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS MORE THAN

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.200
$230 MILLION. AND ACCORDING TO

01:28:59.267 --> 01:29:00.968
THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTRAR OF

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.304
VOTERS, THIS SPECIAL ELECTION

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:05.239
FOR ORANGE COUNTY ALONE TO

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:05.973
GERRYMANDER CONGRESSIONAL

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.241
DISTRICTS AND SPLIT APART

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:09.310
COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT IS

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:11.179
ANTICIPATED TO COST BETWEEN 11

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:13.214
AND 13 MILLION. BY VOTING TO

01:29:13.281 --> 01:29:14.949
PASS SB 280, YOU ARE VOTING TO

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.150
APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR A

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:18.252
COSTLY SPECIAL ELECTION IN A

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:19.253
STATE THAT ROUTINELY SPENDS

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.122
MONEY THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE. IN

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.224
FACT, WE ALL KNOW JUST THIS

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.192
YEAR, CALIFORNIA FACED A BUDGET

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:27.628
DEFICIT OF OF 12 OVER $12

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:30.431
BILLION. AND YOU HAD TO MAKE WE

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:32.667
IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE BUDGET

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:33.301
COMMITTEES HAD TO MAKE PAINFUL

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:35.169
CUTS, AS HAS BEEN REFERENCED IN

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:36.938
HEALTHCARE, FIRE PREVENTION,

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:38.072
EDUCATION, HOUSING AND OTHER

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:40.742
CRITICAL SERVICES. I JUST HAVE

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:45.847
TO ASK HOW THAT THE COST FOR

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:46.414
THE SPECIAL ELECTION OF $230

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:48.182
MILLION COULD HAVE HELPED PLUG

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:50.218
SOME OF THOSE GAPS, AND THOSE

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:51.152
COSTS THAT WERE MANDATED OR

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.354
MADE DESIRE MADE NECESSARY

01:29:53.421 --> 01:29:56.390
BECAUSE OF OVERSPENDING BY THE

01:29:56.457 --> 01:29:58.326
LEGISLATURE AND AND THE

01:29:58.392 --> 01:30:00.428
GOVERNOR. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:02.196
BUDGET FIXES THAT NEED TO

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:04.165
HAPPEN. AND HERE WE'RE PILING

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.167
ON ANOTHER $230 MILLION. WHEN

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.502
WE TALK ABOUT THE VULNERABLE

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:11.305
PEOPLE, $230 MILLION ON THEIR

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:13.007
HEALTH CARE BENEFITS WOULD HAVE

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.076
GONE A LONG WAY. WILDFIRE

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:18.045
MITIGATION. MY PARTY SIDE OF

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:20.314
THE AISLE RECOMMENDED, I THINK,

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:22.016
$1 BILLION FOR WILDFIRE

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:23.384
MITIGATION. I THINK IT CAME IN

01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:25.319
AT 200 MILLION. ANOTHER 100

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.954
MILLION WOULD HAVE HELPED THE

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:27.989
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA TO

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:30.191
MITIGATE ON FUTURE WILDFIRES.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:32.260
WE KNOW THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:34.662
PRIORITIES IN THIS STATE TO

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.565
HELP PEOPLE, TO HELP US BE

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:39.300
PROVIDING OF THE NEEDS AND THE

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:41.936
SERVICES OF OUR COMMUNITIES,

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:44.472
AND $230 MILLION TO BE SPENT

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:46.107
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4TH, WHERE IT

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:48.476
COMES FROM, WHERE WHERE THEY

01:30:48.543 --> 01:30:50.578
FOUND $230 MILLION, WHAT IS NOT

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:52.313
GOING TO BE SPENT, WHETHER IT'S

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.414
ON EDUCATION. I DEAL WITH

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.016
EDUCATORS ALL THE TIME. K

01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:56.117
THROUGH 12 HIGHER EDUCATION,

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:57.819
THEIR BUDGET CUTS, THEIR

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:58.953
RESEARCH CUTS, CUTS ALL ACROSS

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.288
THE BOARD BECAUSE OF A BUDGET

01:31:00.354 --> 01:31:02.056
DEFICIT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.057
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:06.227
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T FUND

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.728
ELECTIONS. THE STATE OF

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:09.130
CALIFORNIA FUNDS ELECTIONS. AND

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:10.498
WHERE'S THIS MONEY COMING FROM?

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:12.366
THE COST OF THIS SPECIAL

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:13.768
ELECTION UNBUDGETED BY THE

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.703
COUNTIES AND NOT PROVIDED FOR

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.205
THE STATE BUDGET PASSED ONLY

01:31:17.271 --> 01:31:19.240
TWO MONTHS AGO, MAKE A MOCKERY

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.441
OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND AN

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:22.043
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:24.312
PROCESS. I THINK TO HYPER

01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:25.079
POLITICIZE THIS EFFORT IS

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:27.682
SHAMEFUL. I WILL SPEAK ALL THE

01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:29.183
REFERENCES TO THE PRESIDENT OF

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.251
THE UNITED STATES. I'M NOT HERE

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.153
TO DEFEND HIM, BUT THE GOVERNOR

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.554
OF THIS STATE OBVIOUSLY HAS

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:35.056
FUTURE INTERESTS, AND THIS ONE,

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:36.290
HE WANTS TO MOBILIZE NATIONAL

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:38.226
ATTENTION. I WILL MAKE THIS AS

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.126
A STATEMENT. AND THAT IS WHAT'S

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:41.262
DRIVING EVERYONE TO MARCH IN

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:44.165
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT HE IS

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:45.366
POSITIONED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:47.068
OF THE UNITED STATES. WE ALL

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:49.070
KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING TO GET

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:50.271
NATIONAL ATTENTION, BUT TO PUT

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:52.006
HOLD HOSTAGE THE TAXPAYERS OF

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:54.108
CALIFORNIA TO FULFILL HIS

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.010
POLITICAL GOALS IS

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:58.045
INAPPROPRIATE. SO I'M OBVIOUSLY

01:31:58.112 --> 01:31:59.180
STRONGLY OPPOSED FOR THESE

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:01.515
REASONS. I'LL BE VOTING NO. AND

01:32:01.582 --> 01:32:02.283
I ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO REALIZE

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.952
THE FOLLY OF THIS ENTIRE

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:06.821
EXERCISE. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.789
LIKE TO RESPOND OR ANSWER IN

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:11.158
YOUR CLOSE? MADAM CHAIR? HAPPY

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:14.028
TO ANSWER MY CLOTHES. OKAY. AND

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:17.498
WE HAVE MR. SLASH. THANK YOU,

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:18.466
MADAM CHAIR. I JUST WANT TO

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:19.267
RESPECTFULLY TO MY COLLEAGUES,

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.602
SAY THAT I DO NOT PLAN TO MARCH

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:22.970
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ANYONE IN

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:25.139
2028 YET, BUT I WILL MARCH IN

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.407
ORDER TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY AND

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:27.942
SUPPORT THE CONSTITUENTS IN MY

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:28.976
DISTRICT WHO ARE BEING SNATCHED

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:32.213
BY THESE AGENTS WITHOUT

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.148
DOCUMENTATION. I AM EVERY DAY

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.617
FEAR FOR MY COMMUNITY THAT I

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:38.052
REPRESENT. SO THIS IS AN

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:39.720
INVESTMENT TO OUR CALIFORNIANS

01:32:39.787 --> 01:32:41.989
THAT WE OWE. I TRULY UNDERSTAND

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:44.191
THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:45.693
SAFEGUARD OUR BUDGET, AND I

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.428
APPRECIATE THAT. BUT THIS IS A

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:48.195
TIME WHERE DOLLARS AT THE

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:51.332
FEDERAL LEVEL ARE AT STAKE. AND

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.167
MEDI-CAL MEDICAID PLAN

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.936
SUPPORTING HEALTHCARE FOR OUR

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:57.104
CALIFORNIANS. SO IN THIS CASE,

01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:59.540
WE WILL MAKE THAT INVESTMENT TO

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:00.207
PROTECT DEMOCRACY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:01.409
THANK YOU. AND THROUGHOUT OUR

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:03.210
AMERICA, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:04.111
REPUBLICAN ISSUE, A DEMOCRAT

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:05.346
ISSUE. THIS IS AN AMERICAN

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.381
ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:33:07.448 --> 01:33:09.050

THAT WE HAD. AND THEN OUT OF

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.092
CURIOSITY, THERE ALSO IS AN

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:19.360
ELECTION FOR ASSEMBLY DISTRICT

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.362
63, WHERE A FORMER COLLEAGUE

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:22.930
WAS PROMOTED TO THIS

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:24.298
ADMINISTRATION AND LEFT THAT

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:26.267
VACANCY, COSTING TAXPAYERS

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:27.134
DOLLARS IN A SPECIAL ELECTION

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:28.235
AS WELL, BECAUSE THEY DID NOT

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.271
FULFILL THEIR TERM. HOW MUCH IS

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:33.541
THAT COSTING US? GOOD MORNING,

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:34.809
MADAM CHAIR, AND MEMBERS AND

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:35.609
STAFF OF THE APPROPRIATIONS

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.382
FOR YOUR QUESTION. MY

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.851
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN 2022,

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:46.988
FOR THE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL,

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:49.156
100 OR $270 MILLION WAS

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:52.660
APPROPRIATED FOR THE EFFORT AND

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:54.195
APPROXIMATELY 200 MILLION WAS

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:56.063
SPENT FOR THE STATE AND THE

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:58.599
COUNTIES. AND IN TERMS OF THE

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:00.968
AD 63 ELECTION, I DON'T HAVE

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:03.604
THAT INFORMATION OFFHAND, BUT I

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.039
AM HAPPY TO GO BACK AND GET

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:08.576
THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU. THANK

01:34:08.642 --> 01:34:10.378
YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:15.116
COMMITTEE MEMBERS? MR. GOOD

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:20.054
MORNING. I JUST AGAIN HAVE SOME

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:22.957
VERY IMPORTANT FISCAL QUESTIONS.

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:25.126
I REPRESENT THE SECOND LARGEST

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:27.161
DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:29.497
CALIFORNIA IN THE ASSEMBLY. I

01:34:29.563 --> 01:34:32.466
HAVE SIX VERY RURAL, VERY SMALL

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:34.368
COUNTIES. SOME OF THEM HAVE

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:37.004
ONLY THREE ELECTIONS WORKERS.

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:39.807
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:42.877
THIS MOVES TO WHERE WE WANT IT

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.378
TO BE. THEY NEED TO BE MADE

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:46.213
WHOLE, TO BE MADE WHOLE. THEY

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.182
ARE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:49.583
MANDATES ON THE STATE. THERE IS

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.652
A VERY BIG DIVIDE IN THIS STATE,

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:53.988
AND IT'S MAINLY URBAN VERSUS

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:55.656
RURAL THAN IT REALLY IS RIGHT

01:34:55.723 --> 01:34:57.291
VERSUS LEFT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.592
THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF THINGS,

01:34:58.659 --> 01:35:00.828
WHICH IS WHAT I AM TRYING TO

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.264
FOCUS ON. I JUST NEED TO KNOW

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.332
WITH THIS BILL THE AMOUNT THAT

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:08.069
IS APPROPRIATED TO IT. IS THIS

01:35:08.135 --> 01:35:11.539
A BLANK CHECK OR DO WE HAVE THE

01:35:11.605 --> 01:35:14.075
DIALED IN APPROACH TO HOW MUCH

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:16.277
FUNDING IS GOING TO ALL OF OUR

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:17.078
COUNTY ELECTIONS CLERKS TO

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:19.213
PERFORM THEIR DUTIES? WE JUST

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.481
NEED TO KNOW ARE THE CURRENT

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:21.682
COST ESTIMATES THAT WERE

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:23.150
GRANTED RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THE

01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:25.953
STATE HAS A TRACK RECORD OF

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.122
BEING OVER 400% OVER ESTIMATES,

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:30.024
WE NEED TO REIN THAT IN. IF THE

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:31.125
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:32.593
ALREADY ADMITTED THAT THERE IS

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:33.961
A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT NEXT YEAR,

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:36.497
THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:38.232
LEGISLATORS IN THE STATE OF

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:41.135
CALIFORNIA TO BE VERY MINDFUL

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:43.437
OF THE DOLLARS AND TAXPAYERS

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:46.173
THAT THEY ARE GIVING US. DO WE

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.109
HAVE ALL OF THOSE DIALED IN, OR

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:51.178
IS IT A BLANK CHECK FOR WHEN A

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.079
COUNTY SAYS, I JUST NEED MORE

01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:53.314
FOR THIS, THAT THEY'RE JUST

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:55.216
AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO GET IT?

01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:56.417
ARE WE JUST GOING TO ALLOCATE

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:57.785
MONEY? WHAT IS THE

01:35:57.852 --> 01:35:59.086
APPROPRIATION LIMIT? DOV. THANK

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:00.354
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:02.123
APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN OVER

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:04.358
THE COSTS. SB 280 INCLUDES AN

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:05.426
APPROPRIATION FOR THE SECRETARY

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:07.094
OF STATE AND ALLOWS THE STATE

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:09.196
COMPTROLLER TO ALLOCATE

01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:10.231
RESOURCES TO COUNTIES BASED ON

01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:12.133
A SCHEDULE THAT WE ARE

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:13.467
CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT WITH

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:15.002
THE SECRETARY OF STATE. SO IT

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:17.304
IS A MOVING IT'S A DEVELOPING

01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:18.405
ISSUE RIGHT NOW, AND WE ARE

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:20.007
WORKING WITH THE SECRETARY OF

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:22.143
STATE TO DEVELOP A SCHEDULE. DO

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:24.044
WE DO WE HAVE A CAP? DO WE HAVE

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:26.213
A CAP ON HOW MUCH CAN BE SPENT?

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.048
BECAUSE I JUST I HAD TO RUN A

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:30.217
BILL TO PUT A CAP ON OTHER

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:32.253
PROJECTS IN THIS STATE. IS

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:33.220
THERE A CAP THERE? SO THAT WAY

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:36.857
WE DON'T GO FROM 250 MILLION TO

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.192
HALF $1 BILLION, AND THAT IS

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:40.294
MORE THAN REASONABLE TO EXPECT

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:41.962
WITH THE TRACK RECORD OF

01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:44.465
PROJECTS IN THIS STATE. THANK

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:45.466
YOU. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:47.067
ABOUT THE COSTS. WE DO HAVE

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:49.170
BENCHMARKS FROM PAST EFFORTS

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:51.038
THAT WE WOULD HEW CLOSE TO.

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:54.175
OKAY. THANK YOU. AND NOW I HAVE

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.543
I REACHED OUT TO ALMOST ALL OF

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:57.011
MY COUNTY ELECTIONS CLERK

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:58.345
ASKING THEM WHAT FINANCIAL

01:36:58.412 --> 01:36:59.813
QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE? HOW CAN

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.081
YOU IMPLEMENT? THERE ARE A LOT

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:03.651
OF RULES IN THIS THAT ALSO

01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:05.019
REQUIRE THEM. COVID ERA

01:37:05.085 --> 01:37:07.955
REGULATIONS, ADDITIONAL VOTERS

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:10.057
CHOICE ACT. SOME OF MY COUNTIES

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:11.425
ARE NOT VOTERS CHOICE ACT

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.394
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.062
THE PERSONNEL TO DO IT. WHEN

01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:16.363
YOU ARE ASKING THREE PEOPLE TO

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.465
SHOW UP, THE LABOR LAWS IN THE

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:20.034
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE VERY

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.602
CONFLICTING WITH THE VOTER

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.037
CHOICE ACT AND THE AMOUNT OF

01:37:23.103 --> 01:37:25.139
WORK THAT THEY CAN DO, AND THEY

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.040
CAN'T ONBOARD AND HIRE FOR A

01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:28.108
TEMPORARY SPECIAL ELECTION. ALL

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:30.177
OF THOSE COSTS ARE SPECIFICALLY

01:37:30.244 --> 01:37:33.480
FOR INYO COUNTY, MONO COUNTY,

01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:35.249
MARIPOSA COUNTY, CALAVERAS

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:36.450
COUNTY, AND TUOLUMNE COUNTY. I

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:39.186
AM HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:40.154
CAN MAKE UP FOR IT, BECAUSE

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:42.122
SOME OF MY COUNTIES JUST THIS

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:43.457
PAST YEAR HAVE HAD TO REDUCE

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:44.959
THEIR BUDGETS BECAUSE THEY

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:46.527
CAN'T AFFORD THE STATE MANDATES

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:49.563
BY 15%. THEY ARE STRUGGLING

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:52.199
VERY HEAVILY. SO THE THE

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.400
QUESTION THAT THEY ARE ASKING

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:55.169
IS THIS PROPOSITION WOULD

01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:57.871
REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

01:37:57.938 --> 01:37:58.472
REDISTRICTING IMPLEMENTATION.

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:01.075
IF THIS IS PASSED BY COUNTIES,

01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:03.644
IS THERE AN APPROPRIATION FOR

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.546
THIS UNSCHEDULED PORTION OF IT

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:07.781
AFTER THE ELECTION IS HAPPENING?

01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:10.251
THE MANDATE THAT IS MANDATED

01:38:10.317 --> 01:38:11.385
WITH THIS MANDATED WORK THAT

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:14.421
MUST BE COMPLETED AFTER THE

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:15.322
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:18.092
ON DECEMBER 2ND AND PRIOR TO

01:38:18.158 --> 01:38:20.227
THE OPENING OF SIGNATURES IN

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:22.196
LIEU ON DECEMBER 19TH, BECAUSE

01:38:22.263 --> 01:38:24.565
THEY'VE GOT ABOUT TWO WEEKS,

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:25.966
TWO WEEKS TO REDO ALL THE

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.234
DISTRICTS TO OPEN THE

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:29.203
SIGNATURES IN LIEU FOR THE

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:30.170
PRIMARY ELECTION, IS THERE

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:32.606
ADDITIONAL FUNDING AFTER THE

01:38:32.673 --> 01:38:34.508
ELECTION IS DONE, APPROPRIATED

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:37.144
TO THEM TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN?

01:45:57.484 --> 01:45:59.052
BOTH DUE TO REDUCED TRAVEL

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:23.043
ARE OTHER ADVANTAGES TO REMOTE

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:24.344
TECHNOLOGY, BUT WE HAVE SAVED

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:25.912
MONEY TO FOCUS ON THE FISCAL

01:46:25.979 --> 01:46:27.114
ISSUES ACCORDINGLY, WE'VE

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:28.181
RECOMMENDED THE KINDS OF

01:46:28.248 --> 01:46:29.082

THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:08.155
THIS FORWARD. I THINK THIS IS

01:47:08.221 --> 01:47:09.389
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK

01:47:09.456 --> 01:47:11.725
AT INTO MODERNIZATION AND THE

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:13.293
ABILITY, ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.195
A DISTRICT THAT IS PRETTY CLOSE

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:20.333
TO 25,000MI², THE SAME SIZE AS

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.269
NORTH CAROLINA, IT'S VERY HARD

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:24.271
TO GET TO A BORDER COMMISSION

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:26.173
FROM ONE END IF THE COUNTY

01:47:26.239 --> 01:47:28.341
OFFICE IS IN ANOTHER ONE. WHEN

01:47:28.408 --> 01:47:30.143
THEY WERE STUCK DURING WHAT

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:32.479
THEY REFERRED TO AS

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:34.481
SNOWMAGEDDON IN 2023 AND 2024,

01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:36.349
THERE WAS NO ABILITY FOR THEM

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:38.051
EITHER. THEY COULDN'T SHOW UP

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:39.219
AND THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:40.453
QUORUM DONE OR THEY COULDN'T

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.222
MAKE THE EFFORTS. AND SO THESE

01:47:42.289 --> 01:47:44.157
CHANGES REALLY HELPED A LOT OF

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:45.358
MY RURAL COUNTIES. I LOOK

01:47:45.425 --> 01:47:46.993
FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER ON

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.129
WHAT WE CAN DO TO REALLY HELP A

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:50.397
LOT OF THESE AREAS, OUR SENIOR

01:47:50.463 --> 01:47:52.432
COMMUNITIES. I HAVE ONE OF THE

01:47:52.499 --> 01:47:53.033
OLDEST DISTRICTS AS WELL, VERY

01:47:53.099 --> 01:47:54.234
LARGE RETIRED POPULATION THAT

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:55.235
LIVE IN THE HIGH SIERRAS THAT

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:57.170
LIVE ON THE EASTERN SIERRAS,

01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:58.805
THAT THIS JUST BENEFITS THEM SO

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:01.208
MUCH. SO IF THERE'S ANY PILOTS

01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:03.143
OR ANYTHING IN THE FUTURE THAT

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:04.811
WE CAN HELP OUT SOME OF THESE

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:05.745
RURAL COUNTIES TO PARTICIPATE

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:07.113
MORE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT, TO

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.181
PROVIDE THEM THE INTERNET

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:09.149
ACCESS SO THEY CAN GET THERE TO

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:11.218
TRY TO DO THAT. THAT'S A BIG

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:13.820
PORTION OF OURS. AND I JUST

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:14.921

REACH, YOU CAN COUNT ME IN. SO

THANK YOU. THIS MODERNIZES

01:50:10.537 --> 01:50:12.138
STREAM SYSTEM ADJUDICATION. THE

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:14.207
STATE WATER BOARD NOW REQUIRES

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:16.042
PERSONAL VISITS EVERYWHERE.

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:18.144
THAT HASN'T CAUGHT UP WITH

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.980
TECHNOLOGY. NOW WITH DRONES AND

REMOTELY. IT DOESN'T COST MONEY.

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:28.154
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THAT

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:30.256
FLEXIBILITY. IT'S EXPECTED AT

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:32.292
LEAST TO BE COST NEUTRAL.

01:50:32.359 --> 01:50:33.526

YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? I

I BELIEVE YOU ARE PRESENTING SB

01:51:30.583 --> 01:51:35.688
513. IF YOU COULD TURN YOUR MIC

01:51:35.755 --> 01:51:41.227
ON TO. THANK YOU CHAIR AND

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:44.364
MEMBERS SB 513 COST WISE HAS

01:51:44.431 --> 01:51:46.599
MINIMAL ABSORBABLE ABSORBABLE

01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:48.768
COST. IT ENSURES THAT QUALIFIED

01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:50.170
EMPLOYEE TRAINING RECORDS ARE

01:51:50.236 --> 01:51:52.572
COMPREHENSIVE OF ALL TRAINING.

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:53.973
USEFUL IN DEMONSTRATING SKILLS

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.208
AND ACCESSIBLE FOR AN EMPLOYEE.

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:57.277
SEARCH FOR A NEW JOB. WHEN

01:51:57.343 --> 01:51:59.012
WORKERS ARE LAID OFF, THEY MUST

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.146
RESPOND QUICKLY TO TRY TO FIND

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:02.348
A NEW JOB. IN SOME CASES,

01:52:02.415 --> 01:52:03.116
TRAINING RECORDS ARE BEING

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:05.185
WITHHELD FROM EMPLOYEES UNTIL

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:07.153
THE END OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.022
IT'S UNFAIR BECAUSE WORKERS

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:11.224
NEED TO PREPARE, VERIFY THEIR

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:11.925
TRAINING CERTIFICATES AND

01:52:11.991 --> 01:52:14.094
SEARCH FOR THEIR NEXT JOB

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.262
OPPORTUNITY IN ADVANCE. NOT

01:52:16.329 --> 01:52:18.198
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. THEY

01:52:18.264 --> 01:52:20.266
HAVE FAMILIES TO FEED AND

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:21.034
COMMUNITIES TO CARE FOR, AND

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:22.268
THEY ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR

01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:24.204
SPECIALTIES. THEY JUST NEED TO

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:25.405
PROVE, THROUGH THEIR TRAINING

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:27.040
CERTIFICATIONS TO FUTURE

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:28.741
EMPLOYERS AND PREPARE FOR THAT

01:52:28.808 --> 01:52:30.276
FUTURE. IT'S ESPECIALLY

01:52:30.343 --> 01:52:32.345
IMPORTANT DURING OUR STATE

01:52:32.412 --> 01:52:34.180
CLIMATE TO MEET OUR STATE

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:35.115
CLIMATE GOALS. BUT HOW WILL

01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:37.584
THEY FIND A JOB IF THEY CAN'T

01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:39.319
GET ACCESS TO THE RECORDS? IT'S

01:52:39.385 --> 01:52:40.253
LIKE IF SOMEONE WAS WITHHOLDING

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.255
YOUR BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND THEN

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:43.423
YOU NEEDED FOR A JOB

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:45.391
OPPORTUNITY, BUT YOU CAN'T GET

01:52:45.458 --> 01:52:46.459
YOUR DEGREE VERIFIED BECAUSE

01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:48.294
IT'S BEING WITHHELD FROM YOU.

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:50.163
AN EXAMPLE MANY EXAMPLES OF

01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:52.966
THIS HAPPENED IN 2020, WHEN THE

01:52:53.032 --> 01:52:54.801
MARATHON REFINERY IN THE BAY

01:52:54.868 --> 01:52:58.671
AREA WAS CLOSED AND IT AFFECTED

01:52:58.738 --> 01:53:00.907
350 WORKERS. MADAM CHAIR, I HAD

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:03.376
WITNESSES HERE TODAY, BUT

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:05.245
UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO FREEWAY

01:53:05.311 --> 01:53:07.046
CLOSURES, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:08.248
MAKE IT. SO THAT'S THE END OF

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:10.283
MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU VERY

01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:12.285
MUCH. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL

FOLKS IN THE ROOM WISH TO

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:16.156
EXPRESS SUPPORT? ANY PRIMARY

01:53:16.222 --> 01:53:18.158
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION? ANY

01:53:18.224 --> 01:53:20.326
ADDITIONAL FOLKS IN OPPOSITION?

01:53:20.393 --> 01:53:21.594
OKAY. WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO

01:53:21.661 --> 01:53:23.363
COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION AND

01:53:23.429 --> 01:53:25.465
A SECOND. ANY QUESTIONS?

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:27.100
COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. WOULD

01:53:29.035 --> 01:53:30.136
IT'S RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

VOTE. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

01:53:32.338 --> 01:53:34.474
THAT IS OUT ON AN A ROLL CALL

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.976

BUT WE HAVE MORE VOTES. BUT THE

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:54.194
SCORE OUR FINAL RUN. WHERE THE

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.995
NORTH BEAT THE SOUTH AND THE

01:53:56.062 --> 01:53:58.431
SOFTBALL GAME. MR. CORTEZ, I

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:11.130
THIS LEGISLATION IS URGENT AND

02:01:11.197 --> 02:01:12.431
NECESSARY, AND I BELIEVE THAT

02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:14.033
HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT,

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.568
AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO

02:01:15.635 --> 02:01:16.435
CHOOSE BETWEEN SEEKING MEDICAL

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:18.304

THINK, PRACTICAL BILL, MAKING

IT EASIER TO DO SO. THE BILL

02:04:26.225 --> 02:04:27.159
REMOVES VAGUE CONVENIENCE.

02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:28.227

ARE PRESENTING SB 630. THAT'S

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:37.263
CORRECT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:41.300
AND MEMBERS. SO THE DEPARTMENT

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:44.003
OF PARKS AND RECREATION HAS THE

02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:45.304
POTENTIAL TO DO A LOT MORE TO

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:46.472
PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND THE

02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:47.539
ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING HELPING

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:49.074
OUR STATE REACH OUR 30 BY 30

02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:51.443
GOALS. THERE ARE LIMITED FUNDS

02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:52.511
AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE CRITICAL

02:05:52.578 --> 02:05:54.213
LANDS NEEDED TO INCREASE

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.548
OUTDOOR ACCESS, PROTECT HABITAT.

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:59.151
AND IT'S MY. I'VE DONE A BIT OF

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:00.452
A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS ISSUE,

02:06:00.519 --> 02:06:02.521
AND WE NEED TO DO THE WORK WE

02:06:02.588 --> 02:06:04.523
NEED TO DO TO REMOVE SOME OF

02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:05.424
THE BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS THAT

02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:06.225
ARE CURRENTLY IMPINGING UPON

02:06:06.292 --> 02:06:07.293
THEIR ABILITY TO STRETCH EVERY

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:08.494
DOLLAR. SIMPLE ACQUISITIONS

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:12.097
HAVE BEEN NOW COSTING VERY MANY

02:06:12.164 --> 02:06:15.567
YEARS DUE TO ONEROUS AND OFTEN

02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:17.436
DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENTS IN

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:18.904
REVIEW. DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:20.239
SERVICES, DGS, AND THE PUBLIC

02:06:20.306 --> 02:06:21.974
WORKS BOARD BOTH FACE

02:06:22.041 --> 02:06:23.542
SIGNIFICANT BACKLOGS MANY

02:06:23.609 --> 02:06:25.678
MONTHS TO YEARS IN SOME CASES

02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:26.211
IN PROCESSING ACQUISITION

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:27.246
PACKAGES FOR MANY STATE

02:06:27.313 --> 02:06:28.414
DEPARTMENTS, AND THEY CAN

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:29.982
IMPOSE AN OUTSIZED BURDEN ON

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:32.151
SIMPLER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:33.552
THE INCURRING OF ADDITIONAL DGS

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:35.421
STAFF COSTS THAT SOMETIMES CAN

02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:37.222
REACH $100,000 PER TRANSACTION.

02:06:37.289 --> 02:06:38.791
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THE

02:06:38.857 --> 02:06:41.327
REVIEW PROCESS IS MORE COSTLY

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:43.062
THAN THE ACTUAL LAND PURCHASE,

02:06:43.128 --> 02:06:45.297
SO WE'VE GOT THIS MASSIVE

02:06:45.364 --> 02:06:48.267
BACKLOG AT STATE PARKS SIMPLE,

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:49.568
STRAIGHTFORWARD ACQUISITIONS.

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:50.369
THERE ARE 52 PROJECTS, FOR

02:06:50.436 --> 02:06:53.105
EXAMPLE, THAT TOTAL ABOUT

02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:54.940
33,000 ACRES. NEARLY ALL ARE

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:56.608
JUST DONATIONS TO THE STATE

02:06:56.675 --> 02:07:00.045
PARKS. AND AND YET WE NOW HAVE

02:07:00.112 --> 02:07:01.347
THIS ONEROUS PROCESS THAT WE'RE

02:07:01.413 --> 02:07:04.283
TRYING TO STREAMLINE THROUGH SB

02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:06.585
630. SO THIS THIS SEEKS TO

02:07:06.652 --> 02:07:08.420
REMOVE DUPLICATIVE REVIEWS.

02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:10.022
THESE ARE WHERE YOU HAVE

02:07:10.089 --> 02:07:11.190
SEVERAL AGENCIES THAT ARE

02:07:11.256 --> 02:07:12.691
ENGAGING IN THE EXACT SAME

02:07:12.758 --> 02:07:14.226
REVIEW FOR SIMPLE ACQUISITIONS,

02:07:14.293 --> 02:07:16.161
ALLOWING OUR STATE PARKS TO BE

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:17.296
MORE RESPONSIVE IN WORKING WITH

02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:18.163
LOCAL PARTNERS TO ADDRESS

02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:19.665
PRESSING NEEDS FOR PARK ACCESS

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:20.499
AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:07:20.566 --> 02:07:22.067
OPERATIONS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO

02:07:22.134 --> 02:07:23.135
RAISE THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH

02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:25.170
DGS IS AUTHORIZED TO WAIVE ITS

02:07:25.237 --> 02:07:26.005
REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF STATE

02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:27.172
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS,

02:07:27.239 --> 02:07:29.141
THOUGH AT A LOWER AMOUNT THAN

02:07:29.208 --> 02:07:30.442
WE HAVE FOR PARKS. THIS WILL

02:07:30.509 --> 02:07:33.145
THIS WILL REDUCE BACKLOG AND

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:34.346
STAFF COSTS AND ALLOW DGS TO

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:36.015
FOCUS ON LARGER AND MORE

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:36.982
COMPLEX ACQUISITIONS THAT

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:38.584
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL REVIEW. I'M

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:39.852
HAPPY TO NOTE THAT THERE'S

02:14:01.133 --> 02:14:02.968
MADE WITH ALMOND MILK, AND I

02:14:03.034 --> 02:14:04.236
HAD TO SPEND NEW YEAR'S EVE IN

02:14:04.302 --> 02:14:06.004
THE ER BECAUSE I DRANK THAT

02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:08.039
HORCHATA. SO THIS IS LOOKING TO

02:14:08.106 --> 02:14:09.341
ENSURE THAT RESTAURANTS PUT

02:14:09.408 --> 02:14:12.644
THAT, DISCLOSE THAT. AND

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:13.678

RESTAURANTS, THERE IS A MINOR

02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:21.453

TO ABSORB INTO THEIR DAILY

02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:30.662
ACTIVITIES. THERE IS A

02:14:30.729 --> 02:14:32.898
FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

02:14:32.964 --> 02:14:34.132
RESTAURANTS DO THEIR MENU WITH

02:14:34.199 --> 02:14:36.134
A QR CODE. IT COULD BE

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:37.235
DIGITALLY, YOU COULD DO AN

02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:38.170
ALLERGEN BOOKLET, YOU CAN PUT

02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:40.205

ADDITIONAL FOLKS WISH TO

02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:54.386
EXPRESS SUPPORT IN THE ROOM?

02:14:54.453 --> 02:14:56.321
ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES IN

OPPOSITION? THANK YOU, MADAM

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:05.497

MANDATES ON OURSELVES AS IT

02:15:18.343 --> 02:15:19.544
RELATES TO ALLERGENS AND

02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:21.213

GUESTS. AND WHAT I'M GETTING AT

02:15:36.294 --> 02:15:37.395

ON THE MENU DIGITALLY OR THE

02:16:19.604 --> 02:16:21.740
PHYSICAL MENU THAT IS THE COST

02:16:21.806 --> 02:16:23.174
DRIVER. THAT'S THE COST DRIVER

02:16:23.241 --> 02:16:24.276

FOR US TO CONSTANTLY BE

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:29.281
SWITCHING OUT MENUS WHEN

02:16:29.347 --> 02:16:31.016
INGREDIENTS CHANGE. THAT'S THE

02:16:31.082 --> 02:16:33.218
BIG ISSUE FOR US. AND SO IF WE

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:35.687
CAN HAVE THE FIRST PART OF THE

02:16:35.754 --> 02:16:36.488

CODE, IF THAT COULD APPLY TO

02:16:40.025 --> 02:16:41.259
THE REST OF THE RESTAURANT

02:16:41.326 --> 02:16:43.161
COMMUNITY, THEN WE'D GET TO A

02:16:43.228 --> 02:16:44.496
PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET BEHIND

02:16:44.563 --> 02:16:46.197
THIS. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:16:46.264 --> 02:16:49.768
TIME. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL

02:16:49.834 --> 02:16:50.835
FOLKS IN THE ROOM WISH TO

02:16:50.902 --> 02:16:52.237
EXPRESS OPPOSITION? OKAY. WE

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:54.639
WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE,

02:16:54.706 --> 02:16:57.175
MISS PACHECO. THANK YOU. AND

02:16:57.242 --> 02:16:58.343
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

02:16:58.410 --> 02:16:59.578
BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT BILL

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:02.847
FORWARD. I KNOW WHEN I'VE

02:17:02.914 --> 02:17:03.982
TRAVELED, I CONSTANTLY GET

02:17:04.049 --> 02:17:06.885
ASKED BY BY SERVERS IF I HAVE

02:17:06.952 --> 02:17:08.186
ANY ALLERGIES OR IF THE PEOPLE

02:17:08.253 --> 02:17:10.555
I'M WITH HAVE ANY ALLERGIES.

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:12.023
AND SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT,

02:17:12.090 --> 02:17:13.358
BUT I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION

02:17:13.425 --> 02:17:15.327
HAS AN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED.

02:17:15.393 --> 02:17:18.697
SO I WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY TO

02:17:18.763 --> 02:17:19.431
WORK IT OUT WITH THE OPPOSITION

02:17:19.497 --> 02:17:21.132
SO THAT THEY CAN GO NEUTRAL.

02:17:21.199 --> 02:17:23.301
AND SO I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE

02:17:23.368 --> 02:17:25.203
SENATOR TO SEE IF THERE'S A

02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:28.239
PATH FORWARD. WE AMENDED THIS

02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:29.674
BILL DRASTICALLY IN THE

02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:32.010
ASSEMBLY. HEALTH WORKED CLOSELY

02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:34.346
WITH THE THE CHAIR. AND I THINK

02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:36.348
THERE WAS A LOT MORE SYMPATHY

02:17:36.414 --> 02:17:37.248
FOR THE FOR THE SMALLER

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:38.617
RESTAURANTS, GIVING THEM EVEN

02:17:38.683 --> 02:17:40.018
MORE FLEXIBILITY. BUT I THOUGHT

02:17:40.085 --> 02:17:41.853
ABOUT OTHER THINGS. I THOUGHT

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.355
ABOUT, LET'S THINK ABOUT

02:17:43.421 --> 02:17:46.324
DIGITAL MENUS IN PARTICULAR. IT

02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:48.226
IS RESPECTFULLY ADDING ANOTHER

02:17:48.293 --> 02:17:51.496
TYPED WORD TO A DIGITAL MENU.

02:17:51.563 --> 02:17:52.931
I'M STRUGGLING TO FIND THE

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:55.467
DIFFICULTY IN DOING THAT. FOR

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:57.235
PRINTED MENUS, THERE ARE MENU

02:17:57.302 --> 02:17:59.337
RESTAURANTS. MENUS CHANGE

02:17:59.404 --> 02:18:02.240
SEASONALLY. WE ADDED A NEW DISH,

02:18:02.307 --> 02:18:04.643
IT GETS DIRTY, YOU HAVE TO

02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:06.344
REPRINT NEW ONES, AND WE WANT

02:18:06.411 --> 02:18:08.813
TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.281
FOR THE CONSUMER. ALL THE BILLS

02:18:10.348 --> 02:18:11.983
THAT WE PASS COLLEAGUES, IT'S

02:18:12.050 --> 02:18:13.585
ALWAYS REALLY HARD TO ENSURE

02:18:13.652 --> 02:18:14.953
THAT THE CONSUMERS KNOW THAT

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:17.389
THIS EXISTS. IF IT'S NOT GOING

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:19.157
TO BE ON THE MENU. YOU'VE BEEN

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:19.991
ACCUSTOMED TO MAYBE THINK THAT

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:22.027
IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ON THE

02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:23.561
MENU. NOW YOU'RE PUTTING THE

02:18:23.628 --> 02:18:24.896
BURDEN ON THE CONSUMER TO ASK,

02:18:24.963 --> 02:18:26.164
HEY, RESTAURANT, DO YOU BY ANY

02:18:26.231 --> 02:18:28.667
CHANCE HAVE A BOOKLET OR AN

02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:30.168
ALLERGEN BOOKLET? WE WANTED TO

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:32.303
MAKE SURE IT WAS AS EASY AS

02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:33.905
POSSIBLE FOR THE CONSUMER,

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:35.106
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING, EVEN

02:18:35.173 --> 02:18:36.374
WHEN YOU'RE ASKED ASSEMBLY

02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:38.009
MEMBER, IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY,

02:18:38.076 --> 02:18:40.478
THERE ARE STILL UPWARDS OF 50%

02:18:40.545 --> 02:18:42.447
ALLERGY CASES STILL OCCURRING.

02:18:42.514 --> 02:18:44.015
EVEN WHEN A WAITRESS OR WAITER

02:18:44.082 --> 02:18:46.284
ASKS YOU IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY.

02:18:46.351 --> 02:18:48.420
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN I'M ASKED AND

02:18:48.486 --> 02:18:49.254
I'M NOTED TO THE SERVER, THE

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:51.189
DESSERT ALWAYS COMES WITH

02:18:51.256 --> 02:18:52.123
PEANUTS ON TOP BECAUSE BY THE

02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:54.092
TIME THE COURSE OF THE DESSERT

02:18:54.159 --> 02:18:55.427
HITS, THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT.

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:56.995
I TOLD THEM THAT I'M ALLERGIC

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:59.564
TO PEANUTS, SO WE WANTED TO

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:00.598
BRING SOME FLEXIBILITY.

02:19:00.665 --> 02:19:02.100
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WE THOUGHT

02:19:02.167 --> 02:19:04.202
WE GOT TO A COMPROMISE. BUT

02:19:04.269 --> 02:19:06.337
LIKE EVERY SINGLE OTHER, LIKE A

02:19:06.404 --> 02:19:08.239
LOT OF OUR BILLS, A LOT OF OUR

02:19:08.306 --> 02:19:10.108
BILLS, WE DON'T ALWAYS GET 100%

02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:12.210
OR WE DON'T ALWAYS INCLUDE 100%

02:19:12.277 --> 02:19:14.245
OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:17.816
ASKING FOR. I GAVE A LOT, AND I

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:18.917
FEEL COMFORTABLE WHERE WHERE

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:21.219
THE BILL IS NOW. AND I JUST

02:19:21.286 --> 02:19:23.988
WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE

02:19:24.055 --> 02:19:26.224
OPPOSITION HAS TO SAY. THANK

02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:28.359
YOU. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION.

02:19:28.426 --> 02:19:30.161
I APPRECIATE THE ISSUE. YOU

02:19:30.228 --> 02:19:32.931
KNOW, WE FIND OURSELVES ASKING

02:19:32.997 --> 02:19:36.534
FOR THE MODEL FOOD CODE, THE

02:19:36.601 --> 02:19:39.170
GOLD STANDARD ON THIS TOPIC.

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:40.905
AND SO WE DON'T REALLY WE'VE

02:19:40.972 --> 02:19:42.240
GIVEN A LOT OF CONCESSIONS ON

02:19:42.307 --> 02:19:44.309
THE BILL IN TERMS OF PROVIDING

02:19:44.375 --> 02:19:45.143
THE DISCLOSURE AND PUTTING OUR

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:46.277
MEMBERS THROUGH THAT, AND WE'RE

02:19:46.344 --> 02:19:48.313
WILLING TO DO THAT. I GUESS I

02:19:48.379 --> 02:19:49.514
FIND MYSELF FIGHTING FOR THIS

02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:50.949
NATIONAL STANDARD OF GOOD

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:52.250
PUBLIC POLICY, AND I DON'T SEE

02:19:52.317 --> 02:19:54.586
IT AS A CONCESSION FROM EITHER

02:19:54.652 --> 02:19:57.088
OF US. THIS IS JUST GOOD, SMART,

02:19:57.155 --> 02:19:58.223
SOUND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE

02:19:58.289 --> 02:20:00.225
GUEST AND THE RESTAURANT. SO

02:20:00.291 --> 02:20:02.160
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER. THAT'S

02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:03.361
WHAT THE OTHER STATES ARE

02:20:03.428 --> 02:20:04.195
LOOKING AT DOING, SHOULD THEY

02:20:04.262 --> 02:20:06.598
GO DOWN THIS ROAD. BUT SO FAR,

02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:07.432
RESTAURANTS, OTHER STATES HAVE

02:20:07.499 --> 02:20:09.167
NOT GONE DOWN THIS EXACT ROAD.

02:20:09.234 --> 02:20:11.703
A LOT OF WHAT WE GRAPPLE WITH

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.271
IS THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF THE

02:20:13.338 --> 02:20:14.005
SUPPLY CHAIN CONSTANTLY

02:20:14.072 --> 02:20:15.340
CHANGING. WE ARE NOT SWAPPING

02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:17.342
MENUS OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS

02:20:17.408 --> 02:20:19.210
GENERALLY. SO THAT'S THE NEED

02:20:19.277 --> 02:20:21.246
FOR GETTING TO THIS STANDARD.

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:22.080
AND THAT WILL CREATE

02:20:22.147 --> 02:20:23.281
CONSISTENCY FOR PEOPLE THAT GO

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:25.316
TO THOSE RESTAURANTS THAT UNDER

02:20:25.383 --> 02:20:27.185
THIS BILL ARE ALLOWED THAT

02:20:27.252 --> 02:20:29.888
FLEXIBILITY. SO IT WOULD CREATE

02:20:29.954 --> 02:20:30.522
PARITY BETWEEN RESTAURANTS. AND

02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:33.158
I THINK THAT WOULD HELP GUESTS.

02:20:33.224 --> 02:20:34.926
THANK YOU. WELL, THANK YOU AND

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:36.094
THANK YOU BOTH. I THINK

02:20:36.161 --> 02:20:38.129
CONVERSATIONS STILL NEED TO BE

02:20:38.196 --> 02:20:39.531
HELD. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

02:20:39.597 --> 02:20:41.132
BILL TODAY, BUT I WILL RESERVE

02:20:41.199 --> 02:20:43.268
MY MY VOTE WHEN WE GET TO THE

02:20:43.334 --> 02:20:44.135
FLOOR. BUT I STILL THINK

02:20:44.202 --> 02:20:45.203
CONVERSATIONS CAN BE HELD,

02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:47.138
ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:20:47.205 --> 02:20:49.307
PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AND I

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:51.176
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR

02:20:51.242 --> 02:20:52.343
WAITERS AND WAITRESSES TO ASK

02:20:52.410 --> 02:20:54.212
IF ANYBODY HAS ALLERGENS SO

02:20:54.279 --> 02:20:56.314
THAT THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE

02:20:56.381 --> 02:20:57.882
KITCHEN AND ASK. AND I'VE SEEN

02:20:57.949 --> 02:20:59.150
THAT MULTIPLE TIMES WHERE THEY

02:20:59.217 --> 02:21:01.619
DO DO IT. SO I'M HOPING THAT

02:21:01.686 --> 02:21:03.054
BOTH OF YOU CAN TALK, BECAUSE I

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:05.190
THINK FURTHER DISCUSSIONS CAN

02:21:05.256 --> 02:21:06.357
ACTUALLY MAKE THIS BILL BETTER.

02:21:06.424 --> 02:21:09.227
THANK YOU, MISS DIXON. THANK

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:12.997
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I'M STRUCK BY

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:14.399
ANOTHER MANDATE ON OUR SMALL

02:21:14.465 --> 02:21:16.367
BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY OUR

02:21:16.434 --> 02:21:17.335
RESTAURANTS. I'VE BEEN DEALING

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:19.304
WITH THIS. THERE'S SO MANY

02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:20.205
ISSUES, BUT I'LL JUST FOCUS ON

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:23.374
FOOD. I HAVE AN ADULT DAUGHTER

02:21:23.441 --> 02:21:24.142
WHO HAS BEEN ALLERGIC TO

02:21:24.209 --> 02:21:26.144
SHELLFISH. MOST OF HER LIFE

02:21:26.211 --> 02:21:28.980
GETS VIOLENTLY ILL. SO HER

02:21:29.047 --> 02:21:31.049
METHOD OF OPERATION WHEN SHE

02:21:31.115 --> 02:21:33.384
EATS IN A RESTAURANT IS TO SAY

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:36.087
TO THE SERVER, TO TELL THE

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:37.922
SERVER TO ADVISE THE SERVER, I

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:39.257
HAVE A SHELLFISH ALLERGY. SHE

02:21:39.324 --> 02:21:41.259
HAS LITTLE CARDS PRINTED UP, I

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:44.062
HAVE A SHELLFISH ALLERGY.

02:21:44.128 --> 02:21:46.865
PLEASE SEPARATE THE FOODS. IF

02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:49.133
TELL THE KITCHEN AND IT HAPPENS.

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:50.902
SHE ALSO HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:52.103
ABOUT IT. SHE SAID IF I GET

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:54.572
SICK AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING,

02:21:54.639 --> 02:21:57.208
WHO CAN I CALL? SO SHE MAKES IT.

02:21:57.275 --> 02:21:59.177
THE RESPONSIBILITY IS ON THE

02:21:59.244 --> 02:22:00.511
PERSON WHO IS DINING AND WHO

02:22:00.578 --> 02:22:02.213
HAS A FOOD ALLERGY THAT CAN

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.381
CAUSE SERIOUS HEALTH

02:22:03.448 --> 02:22:05.683
CONSEQUENCES. MY DAUGHTER HAS

02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:06.284
HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND BEEN

02:22:06.351 --> 02:22:08.620
IN AN EMERGENCY BECAUSE OF HER

02:22:08.686 --> 02:22:09.921
SHELLFISH ALLERGY. I'M JUST

02:22:09.988 --> 02:22:12.457
WONDERING, DO WE IF THERE IS

02:22:12.523 --> 02:22:13.458
GOING TO BE A NATIONAL GLOBAL

02:22:13.524 --> 02:22:15.093
STANDARD, FINE. BUT TO IMPOSE

02:22:15.159 --> 02:22:17.662
ANOTHER REGULATION ON SMALL

02:22:17.729 --> 02:22:19.297
BUSINESS ON OUR RESTAURANTS?

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:21.099
JUST ONE MORE AREA FOR SOMEONE

02:22:21.165 --> 02:22:23.334
TO COME IN AND SAY YOUR TYPE IS

02:22:23.401 --> 02:22:24.836
LARGE ENOUGH, I'M GOING TO SUE

02:22:24.903 --> 02:22:26.237
YOU FOR $50,000, WHICH IS

02:22:26.304 --> 02:22:28.539
REALLY WHAT I HEAR ALL THE TIME

02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:31.476
FOR SOME ADMINISTRATIVE OR ADA

02:22:31.542 --> 02:22:32.243
INFRACTION. PERCEIVED

02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:34.279
INFRACTION. I AM GOING TO VOTE

02:22:34.345 --> 02:22:36.381
NO. BUT IF YOU CAN WORK OUT

02:22:36.447 --> 02:22:37.982
SOMETHING THAT THE INDUSTRY CAN

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:39.217
SUPPORT, THEN I WOULD BE

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:40.919
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AMENDED BILL.

02:22:40.985 --> 02:22:43.421
IT'S JUST ONE MORE REASON WHY

02:22:43.488 --> 02:22:44.289
RESTAURANTS IN MY DISTRICT

02:22:44.355 --> 02:22:45.990
CONTINUE TO CLOSE ONE MORE

02:22:46.057 --> 02:22:48.092
MANDATE FROM THE STATE OF

02:22:48.159 --> 02:22:50.628
CALIFORNIA, ONE MORE POTENTIAL

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:51.095
LAWSUIT THAT'S DRIVING

02:22:51.162 --> 02:22:52.797
BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL OUT

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:54.766
OF CALIFORNIA, OR JUST TO

02:22:54.832 --> 02:22:56.034
SHUTTER THEMSELVES. SO I CAN'T

02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:57.735
VOTE FOR IT. I JUST WISH WE

02:22:57.802 --> 02:22:59.704
COULD WORK OUT A SITUATION THAT

02:22:59.771 --> 02:23:00.605
WOULD WORK FOR THE RESTAURANT

02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:03.207
OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU,

02:23:03.274 --> 02:23:05.710
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL

02:23:05.777 --> 02:23:08.346
COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS? WOULD

02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:11.316
YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? I WOULD SAY

02:23:11.382 --> 02:23:13.484
I GET THE CONCERNS OF THE

02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:15.186
RESTAURANTS, BUT A MISTAKE

02:23:15.253 --> 02:23:17.388
CAUSES A PERSON'S PERSON THEIR

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:19.724
LIFE. THERE'S NO COMING BACK

02:23:19.791 --> 02:23:21.459
FROM THAT. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT

02:23:21.526 --> 02:23:22.493
EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:24.195
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. BUT FOR

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:25.930
PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED WITH

02:23:25.997 --> 02:23:27.432
ALLERGIES THEIR WHOLE LIFE,

02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:29.634
LIKE THAT'S IT'S YES, IT'S YOUR

02:23:29.701 --> 02:23:31.069
RESPONSIBILITY. BUT WHY WOULD

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:33.104
WE DO ANY OTHER BILLS THAT WE

02:23:33.171 --> 02:23:34.939
DO IN CALIFORNIA? BECAUSE WE

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:36.074
WANT TO HELP CONSUMERS. YOU

02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:38.509
JUST HEARD MY PREVIOUS BILL ON

02:23:38.576 --> 02:23:40.511
ADDING HEARING AIDS FOR

02:23:40.578 --> 02:23:42.180
CHILDREN. MAYBE I SHOULDN'T DO

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:43.348
THAT BILL, BECAUSE IT'S A

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:44.449
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARENT TO

02:23:44.515 --> 02:23:46.250
PAY FOR THEIR FOR THEIR HEARING

02:23:46.317 --> 02:23:48.219
AIDS FOR FOR THEIR KID WHO IS

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:49.187
HARD OF HEARING. I MEAN, IF WE

02:23:49.253 --> 02:23:51.456
HAD THAT MENTALITY FOR OTHER

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:52.357
BILLS, WE WOULDN'T DO ANY OF

02:23:52.423 --> 02:23:54.092
OUR BILLS. IT'S IT'S ALSO UPON

02:23:54.158 --> 02:23:55.560
US AS LEGISLATORS TO FURTHER

02:23:55.626 --> 02:23:57.662
HELP OUR CONSUMERS IN

02:23:57.729 --> 02:23:58.262
CALIFORNIA BE BETTER PREPARED

02:23:58.329 --> 02:24:01.232
TO BE SAFE AND THRIVE IN

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:01.966
CALIFORNIA. AND THERE IS

02:24:02.033 --> 02:24:02.967
ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:05.770
MEDIUM AND LARGE RESTAURANTS.

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:07.138
IF A RESTAURANT HAS A QR CODE

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:10.241
AND FOR A DIGITAL MENU, THEY

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:13.177
CAN CHOOSE THE ALLERGEN GRID,

02:24:13.244 --> 02:24:15.780
THE ALLERGEN BOOKLET AS THEIR

02:24:15.847 --> 02:24:18.716
WRITTEN MATERIAL TO PROVIDE TO

02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:20.351
THEIR CONSUMER. SO THERE IS

02:24:20.418 --> 02:24:21.152
STILL FLEXIBILITY FOR THEIR

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:23.087
LARGE RESTAURANTS. AND WE'VE

02:24:23.154 --> 02:24:24.455
SEEN A LOT OF RESTAURANTS MOVE

02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:27.058
TOWARDS THE QR DIGITAL CODE. SO

02:24:27.125 --> 02:24:29.027
IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE AT ALL

02:24:29.093 --> 02:24:32.130
JUST FOR THE LARGE AND MEDIUM

02:24:32.196 --> 02:24:33.264
RESTAURANTS. I'VE BEEN SAYING

02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:34.032
FROM THE BEGINNING, AND CRA

02:24:34.098 --> 02:24:35.166
KNOWS THIS, THAT I WANT THIS

02:24:35.233 --> 02:24:37.468
BILL TO BE US, TO BE SUCCESSFUL

02:24:37.535 --> 02:24:38.936
AND FEASIBLE. AND WE'VE HAD

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:40.471
ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND WE'LL

02:24:40.538 --> 02:24:41.406
CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING

02:24:41.472 --> 02:24:42.940
CONVERSATIONS. HAS IT BEEN A

02:24:43.007 --> 02:24:44.308
CLOSED DOOR? AND WE'LL CONTINUE

02:24:44.375 --> 02:24:46.044
TO DO THAT BECAUSE I WANT THEM

02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:48.012
TO BE SUCCESSFUL, BUT I DON'T

02:24:48.079 --> 02:24:50.214
WANT US TIP IT. PF CHANGS WHEN

02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:53.418
THEY CHANGE THEIR MENU TO

02:24:53.484 --> 02:24:54.218
INCLUDE FOODS THAT WERE GLUTEN

02:24:54.285 --> 02:24:58.089
FREE. SAU 100 140% INCREASE IN

02:24:58.156 --> 02:24:59.257
CONSUMERS GOING TO THEIR

02:24:59.323 --> 02:25:01.059
RESTAURANTS. SO THIS IN FACT

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:04.429
BRINGS PEOPLE OUT MORE AND FEEL

02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:08.132
MORE COMFORTABLE TO TO PARTAKE

02:25:08.199 --> 02:25:09.901
IN THE FOODS GIVEN BY THESE

02:25:09.967 --> 02:25:12.136
RESTAURANTS WHEN THEY FEEL THAT

02:25:12.203 --> 02:25:13.905
THEY HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION

02:25:13.971 --> 02:25:15.173
NEEDED FOR THEM. SO I WOULD

02:25:15.239 --> 02:25:16.507
ARGUE PERHAPS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:25:16.574 --> 02:25:18.709
MAYBE THIS WOULD BE GOOD

02:25:18.776 --> 02:25:19.210
BUSINESS FOR RESTAURANTS

02:25:19.277 --> 02:25:21.145
BECAUSE MORE CONSUMERS WOULD BE

02:25:21.212 --> 02:25:22.346
ABLE TO COME BECAUSE THEY KNOW

02:25:22.413 --> 02:25:24.015
THAT THEY CAN EAT AT THAT

02:25:24.082 --> 02:25:24.649
RESTAURANT WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY

02:25:24.715 --> 02:25:26.184
ASKING FOR NIVO THANK YOU

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:27.185
SENATOR. I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE

02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:29.020
SOME CLOSING COMMENTS ON THIS

02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:31.189
BILL AS WELL. ONE, I WANT TO

02:25:31.255 --> 02:25:31.956
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR PASSION ON

02:25:32.023 --> 02:25:33.124
THIS, AND I KNOW IT COMES FROM

02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:35.193
A PERSONAL PLACE. AND SO THANK

02:25:35.259 --> 02:25:36.794
YOU. I'VE OTHER PEOPLE IN MY

02:25:36.861 --> 02:25:38.029
LIFE AS WELL WHO EXPERIENCED

02:25:38.096 --> 02:25:39.831
SIMILAR THINGS. AND SO I THINK

02:25:39.897 --> 02:25:40.398
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE'S

02:25:40.465 --> 02:25:41.165
TRANSPARENCY AS FOLKS ARE

02:25:41.232 --> 02:25:42.667
ORDERING THINGS BECAUSE AS

02:25:42.733 --> 02:25:44.268
YOU'VE SAID, PEOPLE'S LIVES CAN

02:25:44.335 --> 02:25:45.937
DEPEND ON IT. SO THANK YOU FOR

02:25:46.003 --> 02:25:47.105
BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. I

02:25:47.171 --> 02:25:48.339
ALSO DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE,

02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:49.273
THOUGH THE OPPOSITION AND ALIGN

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:50.942
MY COMMENTS WITH MISS PACHECO,

02:25:51.008 --> 02:25:52.243
THAT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:53.444
OPPOSITION, IT'S NOT THAT THEY

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:54.946
DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE THE

02:25:55.012 --> 02:25:56.114
INFORMATION, IT'S HOW TO DO IT,

02:25:56.180 --> 02:25:58.149
I THINK IS WHAT WHAT THEY'RE

02:25:58.216 --> 02:25:58.950
GRAPPLING WITH AND TRYING TO

02:25:59.016 --> 02:26:01.052
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE SORT OF

02:26:01.119 --> 02:26:02.120
NATIONAL STANDARD WITH WHICH

02:26:02.186 --> 02:26:03.287
THEY CAN OPERATE. AND SO IF

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:05.423
THERE'S A WAY TO LAND THIS THAT

02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:06.457
MAKES IT MORE EASILY

02:26:06.524 --> 02:26:07.258
IMPLEMENTABLE FOR THE

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:08.159
RESTAURANTS, I WOULD LOVE TO

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:10.161
SEE THAT AS WELL. I WANT TO

02:26:10.228 --> 02:26:12.196
MOVE THE BILL FORWARD BECAUSE I

02:26:12.263 --> 02:26:13.064
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOPIC,

02:26:13.131 --> 02:26:14.332
AND I THINK YOU'RE DOING REALLY

02:26:14.398 --> 02:26:16.167
IMPORTANT WORK HERE. BUT I

02:26:16.234 --> 02:26:16.968
WOULD ALSO URGE CONTINUED

02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:17.435
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:26:17.502 --> 02:26:19.504
OPPOSITION, WHO I THINK WANT TO

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:20.972
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO LAND THIS,

02:26:21.038 --> 02:26:22.340
WHERE IT'S EASIER FOR THE

02:26:22.406 --> 02:26:23.307
RESTAURANTS TO IMPLEMENT IT. SO

02:26:23.374 --> 02:26:25.309
AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A PART OF

02:26:25.376 --> 02:26:26.477
THOSE CONVERSATIONS OR NOT. BUT

02:26:26.544 --> 02:26:28.146
ONE WANT THE BUILD TO MOVE

02:26:28.212 --> 02:26:29.380
FORWARD, BUT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

02:26:29.447 --> 02:26:30.948
SEE MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH

TAKE QUESTIONS. THE DFP

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:47.991
CURRENTLY LICENSES ENTITIES IN

02:37:48.058 --> 02:37:49.693

02:38:28.131 --> 02:38:30.934
THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT ARE THE

02:38:31.001 --> 02:38:32.603
FEDERAL FINANCIAL REGULATOR,

02:38:32.669 --> 02:38:34.538
THE CFPB, CAN INTERVENE IN THAT

02:38:34.605 --> 02:38:36.206

UNDER THE CURRENT

02:38:38.308 --> 02:38:39.009

FINANCIAL BAD ACTORS OVER

CONSUMERS. IT'S ALSO MUCH MORE

02:38:42.646 --> 02:38:43.747
EXPENSIVE TO LITIGATE IN

02:38:43.814 --> 02:38:44.581
FEDERAL COURT, ESPECIALLY WHEN

02:38:44.648 --> 02:38:46.216
YOU HAVE TO LITIGATE AGAINST

02:38:46.283 --> 02:38:48.685

REGARDING COSTS, WE'RE

CURRENTLY COVERS 90% OF THE

WHICH IS CURRENTLY FACING A

02:40:25.882 --> 02:40:27.184

BUDGET INCLUDED LARGE

02:40:28.852 --> 02:40:30.420

02:40:59.983 --> 02:41:01.118

WITHOUT CONSULTING THE CFPB,

02:41:08.625 --> 02:41:10.694

02:53:33.169 --> 02:53:35.204
MORNING, MADAM CHAIR. AND

02:53:35.271 --> 02:53:36.973
MEMBERS OF THIS VERY HARD

02:53:37.039 --> 02:53:38.141
WORKING COMMITTEE. I WANT TO

02:53:38.207 --> 02:53:40.343
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

02:53:40.409 --> 02:53:42.345
TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT A VERY

02:53:42.411 --> 02:53:43.546
URGENT ISSUE, A PERTINENT

02:53:43.613 --> 02:53:45.181
FISCAL ISSUE THAT AFFECTS

02:53:45.248 --> 02:53:47.083
FAMILIES ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:49.285
THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT. LET ME

02:53:49.352 --> 02:53:51.420
START WITH THE PROBLEM. THERE

02:53:51.487 --> 02:53:53.289
ARE 150 CEMETERIES, PRIVATE

02:53:53.356 --> 02:53:55.591
CEMETERIES IN THE STATE OF

02:53:55.658 --> 02:53:57.426
CALIFORNIA. SIX OF THEM

02:53:57.493 --> 02:53:58.394
CURRENTLY ARE ABANDONED. MORE

02:53:58.461 --> 02:54:01.097
ON THE LIST THAT ARE COMING.

02:54:01.164 --> 02:54:03.533
AND THIS IS AT A GREAT PROBLEM

02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:04.100
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

02:54:04.167 --> 02:54:06.102
BECAUSE WE CURRENTLY DO NOT

02:54:06.169 --> 02:54:08.571
HAVE A PROCESS TO DEAL WITH

02:54:08.638 --> 02:54:10.106
ABANDONED CEMETERIES,

02:54:10.173 --> 02:54:11.741
CEMETERIES BECOME ABANDONED.

02:54:11.808 --> 02:54:13.042
IRONICALLY, I'M HERE IN THE

02:54:13.109 --> 02:54:15.044
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WHEN

02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:16.879
THEY BECOME NO LONGER

02:54:16.946 --> 02:54:19.348
PROFITABLE, THEY'RE NO LONGER

02:54:19.415 --> 02:54:20.583
PROFITABLE WHEN THEY ARE FULL

02:54:20.650 --> 02:54:21.684
AND PEOPLE CANNOT BE BURIED

02:54:21.751 --> 02:54:24.921
THERE. SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN

02:54:24.987 --> 02:54:26.289
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? WE

02:54:26.355 --> 02:54:27.490
HAVE CEMETERIES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:54:27.557 --> 02:54:29.158
IN EXISTENCE SINCE THE 30S.

02:54:29.225 --> 02:54:31.394
THEY ARE NOW FULL AND WE NEED A

02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:33.596
PROCESS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH

02:54:33.663 --> 02:54:36.032
THEM. YOUR COLLEAGUE, ASSEMBLY

02:54:36.098 --> 02:54:37.300
MEMBER BERMAN, HAD BROUGHT

02:54:37.366 --> 02:54:40.369
FORWARD A BILL, AB 3254, WHICH

02:54:40.436 --> 02:54:42.238
CALLED FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO COME

02:54:42.305 --> 02:54:44.607
TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT WHO IS

02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:46.108
GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE, WHO IS

02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:48.344
GOING TO PAY, WHO IS GOING TO

02:54:48.411 --> 02:54:49.979
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO

02:54:50.046 --> 02:54:52.215
PREVIOUSLY PAID TO HAVE PROPER

02:54:52.281 --> 02:54:54.116
CARE AND TO BE BURIED

02:54:54.183 --> 02:54:56.118
APPROPRIATELY, AND THAT THE

02:54:56.185 --> 02:54:57.286
FACILITIES ARE CONTINUED TO BE

02:54:57.353 --> 02:54:59.155
CARED FOR, THAT THAT PROCESS

02:54:59.222 --> 02:55:02.325
ACTUALLY HAPPENS. MY BILL TALKS

02:55:02.391 --> 02:55:04.360
MORE ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:06.162
FINANCIALLY DO THAT. BUT CHAIR

02:55:06.229 --> 02:55:08.331
BERMAN AND REVENUE AND TAXATION

02:55:08.397 --> 02:55:11.367
HAD ASKED THAT WE ALLOW THE

02:55:11.434 --> 02:55:14.170
PUBLIC THE TIME THAT HE HAD

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:16.105
PREVIOUSLY PUT IN HIS BILL TO

02:55:16.172 --> 02:55:18.708
BE ABLE TO MEET AND DISCUSS IF

02:55:18.774 --> 02:55:20.943
THE COUNTIES OR ANOTHER ENTITY

02:55:21.010 --> 02:55:23.145
WOULD BECOME LEGALLY

02:55:23.212 --> 02:55:25.281
RESPONSIBLE, TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:55:25.348 --> 02:55:27.083
PEOPLE ARE PROPERLY CARED FOR.

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:28.251
I PROVIDED YOU WITH THE

02:55:28.317 --> 02:55:30.019
PICTURES BECAUSE THIS IS URGENT.

02:55:30.086 --> 02:55:32.688
THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE PEOPLE

02:55:32.755 --> 02:55:33.723
ARE TAKING MARKERS OFF OF

02:55:33.789 --> 02:55:36.125
GRAVES TO MELT THE COPPER AND

02:55:36.192 --> 02:55:38.694
THE METAL. YOU SEE THAT THERE

02:55:38.761 --> 02:55:39.562
ARE CRYPTS THAT ARE PHYSICALLY

02:55:39.629 --> 02:55:41.397
OPEN. THESE ARE REAL PICTURES

02:55:41.464 --> 02:55:44.333
OF A CEMETERY IN MY DISTRICT,

02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:45.334
AND THERE ARE OTHER DISTRICTS

02:55:45.401 --> 02:55:47.536
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

02:55:47.603 --> 02:55:50.106
CALIFORNIA. FINALLY, IT'S

02:55:50.172 --> 02:55:51.374
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS

02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:53.676
BILL DOES NOT ADD ADDITIONAL

02:55:53.743 --> 02:55:56.312
COSTS TO THE BUDGET HERE IN

02:55:56.379 --> 02:55:57.179
CALIFORNIA. IT IS SIMPLY SAYING

02:55:57.246 --> 02:55:59.248
THAT THE MEETINGS THEY WERE

02:55:59.315 --> 02:56:00.082
SUPPOSED TO HAVE, THAT THEY

02:56:00.149 --> 02:56:02.118
WOULD HAVE HAD 2 OR 3 YEARS TO

02:56:02.184 --> 02:56:04.220
DO. NOW WE'RE ASKING THEM TO

02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:05.554
ACCELERATE, HAVE THOSE MEETINGS

02:56:05.621 --> 02:56:08.224
PRESENT THE MATERIALS TO THE

02:56:08.291 --> 02:56:09.992
LEGISLATURE BY JUNE, SO WE CAN

02:56:10.059 --> 02:56:11.294
BRING FORWARD AN UPDATED BILL

02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:13.195
TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. I

02:56:13.262 --> 02:56:15.698
UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHAIR HAS

02:56:15.765 --> 02:56:17.133
ASKED THAT OUR WITNESSES LIMIT

02:56:17.199 --> 02:56:18.634
THEIR COMMENTS OR ONLY BE

02:56:18.701 --> 02:56:21.170
AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS, AND SO

02:56:21.237 --> 02:56:23.239
I HADN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. I

02:56:23.306 --> 02:56:25.007
JUST WALKED IN TO SHARE THAT

02:56:25.074 --> 02:56:26.275
WITH OUR WITNESS. SO IF YOU

02:56:26.342 --> 02:56:28.377
COULD JUST VERY BRIEFLY AND

02:56:28.444 --> 02:56:30.780
MAYBE A FEW SENTENCES, SHARE

02:56:30.846 --> 02:56:34.150
WHY YOU'RE HERE. MY NAME IS

02:56:34.216 --> 02:56:35.685
KERRY WEST. I'M HERE

02:56:35.751 --> 02:56:36.686
REPRESENTING THE CITY OF

02:56:36.752 --> 02:56:39.155
COMPTON. COMPTON ITSELF, LIKE

02:56:39.221 --> 02:56:40.289
MANY CITIES THROUGHOUT

02:56:40.356 --> 02:56:42.191
CALIFORNIA, HAS CEMETERIES THAT

02:56:42.258 --> 02:56:45.194
HAVE FALLEN INTO ABANDONMENT OR

02:56:45.261 --> 02:56:47.663
ARE ON THE VERGE OF FALLING

02:56:47.730 --> 02:56:49.165
INTO ABANDONMENT. AS THE

02:56:49.231 --> 02:56:53.402
SENATOR SAID, THEY ARE TARGETS

02:56:53.469 --> 02:56:55.404
FOR ROBBERY, CRIME. AND I'M

02:56:55.471 --> 02:56:57.273
SURE ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE FAMILY

02:56:57.340 --> 02:56:59.041
BURIED IN CEMETERIES DO NOT

02:56:59.108 --> 02:57:01.510
WANT TO SEE THE THOSE

02:57:01.577 --> 02:57:04.246
CEMETERIES AND CRYPTS DECIMATED

02:57:04.313 --> 02:57:07.383
AND DENIGRATED. SO REALLY, WE

02:57:07.450 --> 02:57:09.151
ARE JUST HERE TO STATE THAT

02:57:09.218 --> 02:57:11.620
THIS BILL REALLY DOES HAVE NO

02:57:11.687 --> 02:57:13.089
FISCAL IMPACT. IT IS SOMETHING

02:57:13.155 --> 02:57:14.323
THAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES

02:57:14.390 --> 02:57:16.292

CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN

03:16:22.737 --> 03:16:25.273
CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO START BY

03:16:25.340 --> 03:16:26.174
THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF

03:16:26.241 --> 03:16:28.643

03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:30.078
WE'VE SUBMITTED AUTHOR

AMENDMENTS, ADDING A CIVIL

03:16:31.746 --> 03:16:33.281

CRIMINAL PENALTY IN THE BILL

03:16:35.717 --> 03:16:37.819
DOES NOT IMPLY APPLY IF THERE

03:16:37.886 --> 03:16:39.154
IS A LOCAL POLICY OR A POLICY

03:16:39.220 --> 03:16:41.523
BY THE AGENCY ADOPTED THAT

03:16:41.589 --> 03:16:43.224
MEETS CERTAIN CRITERIA, AND IT

03:16:43.291 --> 03:16:45.326
REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT THAT

03:16:45.393 --> 03:16:46.861
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT

03:16:46.928 --> 03:16:50.365
ARE NOTIFY LOCAL LAW

03:16:50.431 --> 03:16:51.299
ENFORCEMENT AHEAD OF TIME WHEN

03:16:51.366 --> 03:16:55.103
ENTERING A JURISDICTION. SB 627

03:16:55.170 --> 03:16:56.905
EXEMPTS CERTAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:16:56.971 --> 03:16:59.374
ACTIVITIES FROM THE MASKING BAN,

03:16:59.440 --> 03:17:00.208
INCLUDING CERTAIN FORMS OF

03:17:00.275 --> 03:17:02.977
UNDERCOVER WORK, SWAT TEAM, AND

03:17:03.044 --> 03:17:05.313
MEDICAL AND HEALTH MASKING. IT

03:17:05.380 --> 03:17:08.183
ALSO HAS NO IMPACT ON FACE

03:17:08.249 --> 03:17:10.418
SHIELDS THAT YOU CAN SEE

03:17:10.485 --> 03:17:11.519
THROUGH THAT ARE SOMETIMES WORN

03:17:11.586 --> 03:17:17.358
AS RIOT GEAR. ICE IS SOWING

03:17:17.425 --> 03:17:20.562
TERROR IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS

03:17:20.628 --> 03:17:22.063
CALIFORNIA, AND IT'S LAWLESS

03:17:22.130 --> 03:17:24.599
BEHAVIOR IS PUTTING LIVES AT

03:17:24.666 --> 03:17:26.000
RISK. IN FACT, WE ARE ALREADY

03:17:26.067 --> 03:17:29.237
SEEING PEOPLE DIE. ICE'S

03:17:29.304 --> 03:17:31.172
RECKLESSNESS CREATES CHAOS AS

03:17:31.239 --> 03:17:33.308
AGENTS RUN AROUND WITH WHAT ARE

03:17:33.374 --> 03:17:36.711
EFFECTIVELY SKI MASKS AND NO

03:17:36.778 --> 03:17:37.879
IDENTIFICATION. GRABBING PEOPLE,

03:17:37.946 --> 03:17:39.514
THROWING THEM IN UNMARKED

03:17:39.581 --> 03:17:42.217
VEHICLES AND DISAPPEARING THEM.

03:17:42.283 --> 03:17:45.153
BECAUSE THESE AGENTS ARE

03:17:45.220 --> 03:17:47.922
EFFECTIVELY WEARING SKI MASKS,

03:17:47.989 --> 03:17:50.325
THEY LOOK LIKE THE GUY WHO JUST

03:17:50.391 --> 03:17:51.926
ROBBED THE LIQUOR STORE DOWN

03:17:51.993 --> 03:17:54.128
THE STREET, AND PEOPLE HAVE NO

03:17:54.195 --> 03:17:56.231
IDEA WHETHER THESE MASKED

03:17:56.297 --> 03:17:57.031
INDIVIDUALS ARE EVEN LAW

03:17:57.098 --> 03:17:58.299
ENFORCEMENT, OR WHETHER THEY'RE

03:17:58.366 --> 03:18:00.969
VIGILANTES OR BOUNTY HUNTERS OR

03:18:01.035 --> 03:18:02.237
SOMEONE WHO'S ENGAGED IN

03:18:02.303 --> 03:18:04.906
KIDNAPING AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

03:18:04.973 --> 03:18:07.408
WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

03:18:07.475 --> 03:18:09.177
HIDE THEIR IDENTITIES, IT

03:18:09.244 --> 03:18:11.145
DESTROYS COMMUNITY TRUST. IT'S

03:18:11.212 --> 03:18:13.715
HARD TO OVERSTATE HOW HORRIFIC

03:18:13.781 --> 03:18:15.049
AND HARMFUL THIS EXTREME

03:18:15.116 --> 03:18:18.519
MASKING IS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IN

03:18:18.586 --> 03:18:20.455
CALIFORNIA. OVER THE WEEKEND,

03:18:20.521 --> 03:18:22.890
MASKED ICE AGENTS, IF THEY WERE

03:18:22.957 --> 03:18:26.261
ICE AGENTS, APPROACHED A LATINO

03:18:26.327 --> 03:18:28.263
FAMILY IN A CAR IN SAN

03:18:28.329 --> 03:18:29.530
BERNARDINO. THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR

03:18:29.597 --> 03:18:30.331
IDENTIFICATION. THEY DIDN'T

03:18:30.398 --> 03:18:32.967
SHOW A WARRANT. THEY SMASHED

03:18:33.034 --> 03:18:34.636
THE CAR WINDOW, CAUSING THE

03:18:34.702 --> 03:18:36.237
FAMILY, NOT SURPRISINGLY, TO

03:18:36.304 --> 03:18:39.073
DRIVE AWAY IN PANIC. THEY THEN

03:18:39.140 --> 03:18:40.375
THESE AGENTS THEN OPENED FIRE

03:18:40.441 --> 03:18:44.312
ON THAT CAR. WE ALSO JUST

03:18:44.379 --> 03:18:46.247
LEARNED THAT A CALIFORNIA

03:18:46.314 --> 03:18:48.283
TEENAGER, BENJAMIN GUERRERO

03:18:48.349 --> 03:18:52.086
CRUZ, WHO WAS GRABBED BY MASKED

03:18:52.153 --> 03:18:53.288
AGENTS OR BOUNTY HUNTERS OR

03:18:53.354 --> 03:18:55.723
WHOEVER THEY WERE, AND THAT

03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:57.692
WHILE IN CUSTODY, HE OVERHEARD

03:18:57.759 --> 03:18:59.994
THEM TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE

03:19:00.061 --> 03:19:02.764
GOING TO RECEIVE $1,500 FOR HIS

03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:04.065
ARREST, CAUSING SERIOUS CONCERN

03:19:04.132 --> 03:19:07.535
THAT WE HAVE ICE FUNDED BOUNTY

03:19:07.602 --> 03:19:09.304
HUNTERS ROAMING CALIFORNIA

03:19:09.370 --> 03:19:12.340
UNDER THE TRUMP REGIME. THIS IS

03:19:12.407 --> 03:19:15.810
NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS AN

03:19:15.877 --> 03:19:18.413
AUTHORITARIAN NIGHTMARE WITH

03:19:18.479 --> 03:19:20.715
WITH MASKED THUGS RUNNING

03:19:20.782 --> 03:19:21.883
AROUND GRABBING AND

03:19:21.949 --> 03:19:23.151
DISAPPEARING PEOPLE TO EL

03:19:23.217 --> 03:19:25.386
SALVADOR OR ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ

03:19:25.453 --> 03:19:28.222
OR SOME OTHER GULAG, AND PEOPLE

03:19:28.289 --> 03:19:30.591
HAVE NO IDEA WHO'S EVEN

03:19:30.658 --> 03:19:31.225
GRABBING THEM. THIS INEVITABLY

03:19:31.292 --> 03:19:33.895
LEADS TO FEAR, CONFUSION AND

03:19:33.961 --> 03:19:35.997
VIOLENCE. AND EXTREME MASKING

03:19:36.064 --> 03:19:38.633
IN MANY WAYS IS AT THE HEART OF

03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:41.002
IT. IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO

03:19:41.069 --> 03:19:42.937
SOMEONE IS OR WHETHER THEY'RE A

03:19:43.004 --> 03:19:44.038
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, THAT

03:19:44.105 --> 03:19:47.141
IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR SOCIETY,

03:19:47.208 --> 03:19:49.577
AND THIS BILL AIMS TO PUT AN

03:19:49.644 --> 03:19:52.213
END TO THIS PRACTICE, AND WE

03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:53.348
KNOW WHY IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE

03:19:53.414 --> 03:19:56.150
OF THIS INSANE 3000 PERSON A

03:19:56.217 --> 03:19:57.418
DAY DEPORTATION REQUIREMENT

03:19:57.485 --> 03:19:59.187
THAT STEPHEN MILLER AND DONALD

03:19:59.253 --> 03:20:01.289
TRUMP HAVE IMPOSED ON ICE. AND

03:20:01.356 --> 03:20:02.990
WE ALSO KNOW IT'S GOING TO GET

03:20:03.057 --> 03:20:04.659
WORSE. CONGRESS, AT TRUMP'S

03:20:04.726 --> 03:20:06.761
REQUEST, JUST APPROPRIATED $45

03:20:06.828 --> 03:20:09.497
BILLION IN A SLUSH FUND FOR ICE

03:20:09.564 --> 03:20:11.199
TO HIRE 10,000 NEW OFFICERS,

03:20:11.265 --> 03:20:13.101
AND PRESUMABLY TO PAY FOR

03:20:13.167 --> 03:20:14.302
BOUNTY HUNTERS AS WELL, AND

03:20:14.369 --> 03:20:16.170
EVEN MORE MONEY TO BUILD MORE

03:20:16.237 --> 03:20:19.640
OF THESE GULAGS. THIS HAS SO

03:20:19.707 --> 03:20:22.443
MANY RAMIFICATIONS FOR PUBLIC

03:20:22.510 --> 03:20:24.946
SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE

03:20:25.012 --> 03:20:27.215
IF PEOPLE ASSOCIATE POLICE WITH

03:20:27.281 --> 03:20:31.486
WHAT ICE IS DOING, WHY ON EARTH

03:20:31.552 --> 03:20:32.620
WOULD THEY EVER TRUST ANY

03:20:32.687 --> 03:20:35.256
POLICE OFFICER? AND LET'S NOT

03:20:35.323 --> 03:20:37.225
FOOL OURSELVES INTO THINKING

03:20:37.291 --> 03:20:38.092
THAT THIS WON'T HAVE IMPACTS ON

03:20:38.159 --> 03:20:40.328
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:20:40.395 --> 03:20:41.963
WE KNOW THAT WHEN PRESIDENT

03:20:42.029 --> 03:20:43.231
TRUMP ATTACKS SANCTUARY CITIES

03:20:43.297 --> 03:20:45.166
AND SANCTUARY STATES, WHAT HE'S

03:20:45.233 --> 03:20:47.034
TRYING TO DO IS TO FORCE STATE

03:20:47.101 --> 03:20:50.238
AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

03:20:50.304 --> 03:20:51.973
HELP ICE WITH IMMIGRATION

03:20:52.039 --> 03:20:54.475
ENFORCEMENT. OUR STATE AND

03:20:54.542 --> 03:20:55.343
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

03:20:55.410 --> 03:20:57.378
WORK SO HARD TO KEEP OUR

03:20:57.445 --> 03:21:00.281
COMMUNITIES SAFE, AND I RESPECT

03:21:00.348 --> 03:21:02.016
THEM TREMENDOUSLY. I HAVE GRAVE

03:21:02.083 --> 03:21:03.217
CONCERN FOR WHAT THE FUTURE

03:21:03.284 --> 03:21:05.153
HOLDS FOR ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:21:05.219 --> 03:21:07.088
IF WE KEEP GOING DOWN THIS ROAD,

03:21:07.155 --> 03:21:08.322
AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL

03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:10.191
APPLIES TO ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:21:10.258 --> 03:21:12.226
WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THIS

03:21:12.293 --> 03:21:14.262
DISASTROUS PRACTICE AND PUT A

03:21:14.328 --> 03:21:16.063
STOP TO IT NOW BEFORE IT GROWS

03:21:16.130 --> 03:21:18.666
EVEN FURTHER. IT IS MAKING A

03:21:18.733 --> 03:21:20.101
MOCKERY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I

03:21:20.168 --> 03:21:21.536
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

03:21:21.602 --> 03:21:23.037

FOR BOTH SAN BERNARDINO AND

03:21:48.629 --> 03:21:49.330
RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND IT IS

03:21:49.397 --> 03:21:51.065
THROUGH THIS HOTLINE THAT WE

03:21:51.132 --> 03:21:53.301
HAVE A DIRECT PULSE ON THE FEAR

03:21:53.367 --> 03:21:55.136
THAT OUR EXPERIENCE THAT OUR

03:21:55.203 --> 03:21:56.304

03:21:56.370 --> 03:21:58.372
RIGHT NOW, THAT THEY'VE BECOME

03:21:58.439 --> 03:22:00.041
BATTLEGROUNDS FOR THE ABUSIVE

03:22:00.107 --> 03:22:01.242
RAIDS CARRIED OUT BY THE MASS

03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:03.277
THUGS OF THE TRUMP

03:22:03.344 --> 03:22:04.045
ADMINISTRATION. IT IS BY

03:22:04.111 --> 03:22:06.113
CONCEALING THEIR FACES THAT

03:22:06.180 --> 03:22:07.014
THESE AGENTS HAVE BEEN

03:22:07.081 --> 03:22:09.016
EMPOWERED TO ACT WITH COMPLETE

03:22:09.083 --> 03:22:10.618
IMPUNITY. THEY VIOLATE CIVIL

03:22:10.685 --> 03:22:12.119
RIGHTS. THEY TEAR OUR FAMILIES

03:22:12.186 --> 03:22:14.055
APART WITH NO CONSEQUENCES.

03:22:14.121 --> 03:22:15.323
JUST THIS WEEKEND, AS THE

03:22:16.991 --> 03:22:19.227
FEDERAL AGENTS BROKE THE CAR

03:22:19.293 --> 03:22:20.661

WHEN THE FAMILY DROVE OFF IN

03:22:24.332 --> 03:22:26.367
PANIC, THE AGENTS SHOT AT THE

03:22:29.971 --> 03:22:32.073
INJURE SOMEONE OR KILL SOMEONE.

03:22:32.139 --> 03:22:35.009
THEY WERE 118 YEAR OLD IN THAT

03:22:35.076 --> 03:22:37.411
CAR. IT WAS A FAMILY THAT WAS

03:22:37.478 --> 03:22:39.647
DRIVING. THEY WERE PULLED OVER

03:22:39.714 --> 03:22:41.182
FOR NO OTHER REASON BESIDES THE

03:22:41.249 --> 03:22:43.050

IMPERSONATION LAWS AND REQUIRE

03:28:59.426 --> 03:29:01.061

IDENTIFICATION FEATURING THEIR

03:29:04.031 --> 03:29:06.233
NAME OR BADGE NUMBER. IT WILL

03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:08.002
ALSO AUTHORIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:29:08.068 --> 03:29:10.037
TO REQUEST IDENTIFICATION FROM

03:29:10.104 --> 03:29:11.171
ANYONE CLAIMING TO BE AN

OFFICER, IF THERE IS A

03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:14.475
REASONABLE SUSPICION OF

03:29:14.541 --> 03:29:15.676
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, SUCH AS

03:29:15.743 --> 03:29:17.945
IMPERSONATING A PEACE OFFICER,

03:29:18.012 --> 03:29:20.247
KIDNAPING, OR WHEN THERE IS A

03:29:20.314 --> 03:29:21.248
LEGITIMATE SAFETY CONCERN.

03:29:21.315 --> 03:29:23.017
ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL PROHIBIT

03:29:23.083 --> 03:29:24.318
BOUNTY HUNTERS FROM ENGAGING IN

03:29:24.385 --> 03:29:25.920
ANY FORM OF IMMIGRATION

03:29:25.986 --> 03:29:29.223
ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE FACING AN

03:29:29.290 --> 03:29:30.224
EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT IN

03:29:30.291 --> 03:29:32.226
CALIFORNIA. MASKED INDIVIDUALS

03:29:32.293 --> 03:29:34.962
WITH NO NAME IDENTIFICATION, NO

03:29:35.029 --> 03:29:36.163
UNIFORMS, DRIVING UNMARKED

03:29:36.230 --> 03:29:38.532
VEHICLES AND CARRYING FIREARMS

03:29:38.599 --> 03:29:39.934
ARE TAKING OUR NEIGHBORS, BOTH

03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:41.568
IMMIGRANTS AND AMERICAN

03:29:41.635 --> 03:29:43.237
CITIZENS, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

03:29:43.304 --> 03:29:45.072
WHEN ASKED BY MEMBERS OF THE

03:29:45.139 --> 03:29:47.107
PUBLIC TO PROVIDE BADGE NUMBERS

03:29:47.174 --> 03:29:49.143
THEY REFUSE. WE ASSUME THEY ARE

03:29:49.209 --> 03:29:51.445
FEDERAL AGENTS FROM HOMELAND

03:29:51.512 --> 03:29:52.413
SECURITY OR ICE OR CALIFORNIA

03:29:52.479 --> 03:29:55.182
BORDER PATROL. HOWEVER, UNLESS

03:29:55.249 --> 03:29:57.985
THESE INDIVIDUALS PROVIDE

03:29:58.052 --> 03:29:58.986
PROPER IDENTIFICATION, WE

03:29:59.053 --> 03:30:01.722
SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW. AND WHEN WE

03:30:01.789 --> 03:30:03.057
RECEIVE REPORTS OF THESE

03:30:03.123 --> 03:30:04.291
INDIVIDUALS USING EXCESSIVE

03:30:04.358 --> 03:30:06.226
FORCE WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION,

03:30:06.293 --> 03:30:08.028
THERE IS NO WAY TO ENSURE

03:30:08.095 --> 03:30:10.197
OVERSIGHT OR ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:30:10.264 --> 03:30:12.032
AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO

03:30:12.099 --> 03:30:13.600
ACKNOWLEDGE PART OF THE REASON

03:30:13.667 --> 03:30:15.536
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. SOME OF

03:30:15.602 --> 03:30:17.037
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD REPORTS THIS

03:30:17.104 --> 03:30:19.373
PAST WEEKEND THAT A GENTLEMAN

03:30:19.440 --> 03:30:21.342
NAMED ROBERTO CARLOS MONTOYA

03:30:21.408 --> 03:30:23.277
VALDEZ WAS KILLED IN MONROVIA

03:30:23.344 --> 03:30:25.679
WHILE HE WAS RUNNING FROM

03:30:25.746 --> 03:30:27.114
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

03:30:27.181 --> 03:30:29.283
OFFICERS AT A HOME DEPOT. HE

03:30:29.350 --> 03:30:31.318
RAN ONTO THE 210 FREEWAY AND

03:30:31.385 --> 03:30:33.387
WAS STRUCK BY A VEHICLE. HE HAS

03:30:33.454 --> 03:30:35.222
SINCE PASSED AWAY. THIS IS THE

03:30:35.289 --> 03:30:37.191
SECOND PERSON THAT HAS DIED

03:30:37.257 --> 03:30:39.059
DURING AN ICE RAID. WE HAVE NO

03:30:39.126 --> 03:30:42.296
IDEA IF THOSE OFFICERS ARE

03:30:42.363 --> 03:30:43.030
MEMBERS OF DEPARTMENT OF

03:30:43.097 --> 03:30:46.433
HOMELAND SECURITY, OF CBP, OF

03:30:46.500 --> 03:30:48.035
ICE, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT

03:30:48.102 --> 03:30:49.603
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. WE DON'T

03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:51.338
HAVE NAMES OR BADGE NUMBERS. SO

03:30:51.405 --> 03:30:54.074
THIS IS JUST PART OF THE REASON

03:30:54.141 --> 03:30:55.142
WHY OVERSIGHT AND

03:30:55.209 --> 03:30:56.977
ACCOUNTABILITY IS SO CRITICAL

03:30:57.044 --> 03:30:59.146
IN THIS MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE

03:30:59.213 --> 03:31:01.115
CASES LIKE THIS HAPPEN ACROSS

03:31:01.181 --> 03:31:02.316
THE COUNTRY. THERE HAVE ALSO

03:31:02.383 --> 03:31:04.218
BEEN REPORTS OF CRIMINALS

03:31:04.284 --> 03:31:04.985
IMPERSONATING ICE OFFICERS,

03:31:05.052 --> 03:31:06.253
USING THREATS AND INTIMIDATION

03:31:06.320 --> 03:31:08.455
TO TARGET VULNERABLE

03:31:08.522 --> 03:31:09.590
COMMUNITIES. WE'VE SEEN THIS

03:31:09.656 --> 03:31:12.092
WITH PEOPLE IMPERSONATING ICE

03:31:12.159 --> 03:31:13.360
OFFICERS, TARGETING WOMEN WITH

03:31:13.427 --> 03:31:15.529
SEXUAL HARASSMENT. WE'VE SEEN

03:31:15.596 --> 03:31:17.431
OTHER CRIMINALS UTILIZE THIS IN

03:31:17.498 --> 03:31:19.333
CITIES LIKE HUNTINGTON PARK

03:31:19.400 --> 03:31:21.068
RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

03:31:21.135 --> 03:31:22.136
UNFORTUNATELY, THESE HAVE

03:31:22.202 --> 03:31:23.370
BECOME COMMON EVENTS WHEN

03:31:23.437 --> 03:31:24.505
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

03:31:24.571 --> 03:31:26.173
OFFICERS FAIL TO IDENTIFY

03:31:26.240 --> 03:31:27.207
THEMSELVES, THEY CREATE

03:31:27.274 --> 03:31:29.676
OPPORTUNITIES FOR VIGILANTES TO

03:31:29.743 --> 03:31:31.178
TARGET OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS

03:31:31.245 --> 03:31:32.980
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY FOSTERS

03:31:33.047 --> 03:31:34.615
CONFUSION, FEAR, AND MISTRUST

03:31:34.681 --> 03:31:36.250
IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE.

03:31:36.316 --> 03:31:38.018
THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PROPOSAL

03:31:38.085 --> 03:31:40.521
TO PREVENT IMPERSONATING LAW

03:31:40.587 --> 03:31:41.989
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHILE

03:31:42.056 --> 03:31:43.157
ENSURING BASIC OVERSIGHT AND

03:31:43.223 --> 03:31:44.925
ACCOUNTABILITY DURING

03:31:44.992 --> 03:31:46.226
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. JOINING ME

03:32:16.590 --> 03:32:18.525
AND AS A PROUD CO-SPONSOR OF SB

03:32:18.592 --> 03:32:21.195

805 IS ABOUT RESTORING TRUST,

03:32:23.097 --> 03:32:25.866
PROTECTING FAMILIES AND

03:32:25.933 --> 03:32:26.967
ENSURING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.

03:32:27.034 --> 03:32:29.536
THIS BILL DOES THREE SIMPLE BUT

03:32:29.603 --> 03:32:30.404
CRITICAL THINGS. IT STRENGTHENS

03:32:30.471 --> 03:32:32.005
CALIFORNIA LAW AGAINST

03:32:32.072 --> 03:32:34.475
IMPERSONATING LAW ENFORCEMENT,

03:32:34.541 --> 03:32:36.410
INCLUDING FEDERAL OFFICERS IT

03:32:36.477 --> 03:32:40.013
REQUIRES NON-UNIFORMED OFFICERS

03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:42.149
FROM ENGAGING IN IMMIGRATION

03:32:42.216 --> 03:32:43.951
ENFORCEMENT OR SHARING PERSONAL

03:32:44.017 --> 03:32:46.186
INFORMATION FOR THAT PURPOSE,

03:32:46.253 --> 03:32:47.955
AND IT PREVENTS BOUNTY HUNTERS

03:32:48.021 --> 03:32:49.590
FROM ENGAGING IN IMMIGRATION

03:32:49.656 --> 03:32:51.191
ENFORCEMENT OR SHARING PERSONAL

03:32:51.258 --> 03:32:52.960
INFORMATION FOR THAT PURPOSE.

03:32:53.026 --> 03:32:54.194
WE HAVE SEEN DANGEROUS

03:32:54.261 --> 03:32:56.163
SITUATIONS WHERE UNMASKED

03:32:56.230 --> 03:32:57.998
INDIVIDUALS HAVE CLAIMED TO BE

03:32:58.065 --> 03:32:59.533
FEDERAL AGENTS, LEAVING

03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:00.901
FAMILIES TERRIFIED COMMUNITIES

03:33:00.968 --> 03:33:04.104
VULNERABLE WITHOUT CLEAR

03:33:04.171 --> 03:33:06.039
IDENTIFICATION. RESIDENTS CAN'T

03:33:06.106 --> 03:33:08.142
TELL IF SOMEONE AT THEIR DOOR

03:33:08.208 --> 03:33:09.776
IS LEGITIMATE, IS A LEGITIMATE

03:33:09.843 --> 03:33:13.180
OFFICER OR A VIGILANTE. PUTTING

BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY AND DUE

03:33:14.381 --> 03:33:17.451
PROCESS AT RISK. THIS BILL ALSO

03:33:17.518 --> 03:33:18.952
MAKES FISCAL SENSE BY REQUIRING

03:33:19.019 --> 03:33:21.054
AGENCIES TO ADOPT A PUBLIC

03:33:21.121 --> 03:33:22.289
PUBLICLY AND POST CLEAR

03:33:22.356 --> 03:33:24.591

03:33:24.658 --> 03:33:26.727
LITIGATION, PREVENTS ABUSE, AND

03:33:26.793 --> 03:33:28.228
STRENGTHENS COMMUNITY TRUST IN

ESCALATES, SAVES LIVES,

03:33:32.432 --> 03:33:33.534
PREVENTS WRONGFUL DETENTIONS,

03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:35.235
AND AVOIDS EXPANSIVE LAWSUITS

03:33:35.302 --> 03:33:38.005
AGAINST THE STATE. CALIFORNIA

03:33:38.071 --> 03:33:39.740
HAS LONG LED THE NATION IN

03:33:39.806 --> 03:33:40.741
PROTECTING IMMIGRANT AND

03:33:40.807 --> 03:33:43.010

ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE

03:33:49.383 --> 03:33:50.884
ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THESE

03:33:50.951 --> 03:33:52.352
REASONS, WE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK

03:34:26.053 --> 03:34:29.756
OF THAT WORK. I'M HERE TODAY

BE CO-SPONSORS FOR SB 805. THE

03:34:44.204 --> 03:34:45.939
RECENT ICE RAIDS HAVE CAUSED

03:34:46.006 --> 03:34:47.608
WIDESPREAD FEAR AND CONFUSION

03:34:47.674 --> 03:34:48.141
IN OUR COMMUNITIES,

03:34:48.208 --> 03:34:49.910
PARTICULARLY WHEN OFFICERS

LACKING CLEAR IDENTIFICATION.

03:34:57.851 --> 03:34:59.152
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE

03:34:59.219 --> 03:35:01.154
BEEN GROWING CONCERNS AMONG

03:35:01.221 --> 03:35:02.389

KIDNAPINGS AND THE USE OF

03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:11.865
EXCESSIVE FORCE, WHICH MAKES

03:35:11.932 --> 03:35:13.333
ACCOUNTABILITY IMPOSSIBLE.

03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:15.102
ADDITIONALLY, MULTIPLE NEWS

WITH RESPECT TO THEIR FAMILIES

03:35:51.505 --> 03:35:53.440

03:35:53.507 --> 03:35:55.142

03:35:55.208 --> 03:35:56.943
HERE TO TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW.

03:35:57.010 --> 03:35:59.146

OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT,

03:39:10.570 --> 03:39:12.405
TONY THURMOND, WE'RE PROUD TO

03:39:12.472 --> 03:39:13.173
SPONSOR THIS BILL. THIS

03:39:13.240 --> 03:39:14.207
LEGISLATION PROVIDES AN

03:39:14.274 --> 03:39:16.009
IMPORTANT TOOL FOR SCHOOLS TO

03:39:16.076 --> 03:39:17.043
ALLOW EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION.

03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:19.212
WE ARE OBLIGATED BY THE STATE

03:39:19.279 --> 03:39:21.014
AND BY OUR CONSTITUTION TO

03:39:21.081 --> 03:39:23.183
PROVIDE SAFE AND STABLE SCHOOLS.

03:39:23.250 --> 03:39:25.385
WE ARE SEEING AN UPTICK IN

03:39:25.452 --> 03:39:27.220
FAMILIES BEING FEARFUL, AND

03:39:27.287 --> 03:39:29.022
THAT'S AFFECTING HAS A RIPPLE

03:39:29.089 --> 03:39:30.123
EFFECT ON ATTENDANCE. WE HAVE

03:39:30.190 --> 03:39:31.258
RECENT REPORTS OUT, BUT ALSO

03:39:31.324 --> 03:39:33.059
SCHOOL IS NOW BACK IN SESSION.

03:39:33.126 --> 03:39:35.095
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF

03:39:35.161 --> 03:39:36.530
SCHOOLS REOPENING, WE ARE

03:39:36.596 --> 03:39:37.130

OF ICE ENFORCEMENT COMING ONTO

03:39:40.133 --> 03:39:41.101
SCHOOL SITES. WE'VE HAD PARENTS

03:39:41.167 --> 03:39:43.169
PICKED UP AT DROP OFF AT THE

03:39:43.236 --> 03:39:45.305
SCHOOL BUS SITES, AND RECENTLY

03:39:45.372 --> 03:39:46.506
THERE WAS A DISABLED STUDENT

03:39:46.573 --> 03:39:48.008
WRONGFULLY DETAINED THERE,

03:39:48.074 --> 03:39:49.509
ESCALATING IN THEIR BEHAVIOR.

03:39:49.576 --> 03:39:50.410
AND WE NEED TO ESCALATE IN HOW

03:39:50.477 --> 03:39:51.945
WE COMMUNICATE TO SCHOOLS SO

03:39:52.012 --> 03:39:53.179
THEY CAN FEEL SAFE. SO THE

03:39:53.246 --> 03:39:54.247
FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE

03:39:54.314 --> 03:39:55.482
COMMUNITY CAN DO WHAT'S BEST

03:39:55.549 --> 03:39:57.417
FOR THEM AND THEIR STUDENTS.

03:39:57.484 --> 03:39:59.185
THIS BILL DOES THAT. THE

03:39:59.252 --> 03:40:00.387
AMENDMENTS WE WORKED ON WITH

03:40:00.453 --> 03:40:02.389
OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND THE

03:40:02.455 --> 03:40:03.890
ADMINISTRATION ALLOWED A MERE

03:40:03.957 --> 03:40:05.559
EXISTING PLANS. IT ALLOWS FOR

03:40:05.625 --> 03:40:06.493
THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED BECAUSE

03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:08.228
WE KNOW THERE'S A NUANCE FOR

03:40:08.295 --> 03:40:09.129
DIFFERENT DISTRICTS, AND WE

03:40:09.195 --> 03:40:10.997
BELIEVE THAT WE MET THEM WHERE

03:40:11.064 --> 03:40:13.633
THEY'RE AT. WE ALSO, AS A CDE,

03:40:13.700 --> 03:40:14.601
WILL BE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL

03:40:14.668 --> 03:40:15.101
RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP

03:40:15.168 --> 03:40:17.270
EXPEDITE THAT TIMELINE. WE

03:40:17.337 --> 03:40:18.438
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE SUPPORT

03:40:18.505 --> 03:40:21.141
OF THIS BILL. IT'S TIMELY, IT'S
