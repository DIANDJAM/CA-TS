ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:31.214

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:34.918
I WILL JUST PUT ONE ISSUE FRONT

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.720

STILL UNRESOLVED AND THAT IS

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:45.762
AROUND OUR RIVERS. IF YOU LOOK

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:48.265
RIGHT BEHIND US, THE GORGE THAT

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.699
LEADS INTO MILLERTON LAKE LEADS

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:51.868
INTO THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER,

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:53.370
WHICH IS THE SECOND LONGEST

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:54.804
RIVER IN CALIFORNIA, A RIVER

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:58.375

DANGER FROM A CORPORATION

00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:04.247

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:06.049
LEASE. THAT'S BEFORE OUR BOARD

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:08.184

HERE. NONE OF IT CAN GET DONE

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:56.499
ALONE. IT REQUIRES US TO WORK

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:57.334
TOGETHER IN COLLABORATION. AND

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.636

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:01.871
IS MÀ AND THANK YOU FOR THE

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:03.172
OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN FRONT OF

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:04.841
YOU TODAY. SO I THOUGHT I CAN

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:07.944
SHARE SOME, BOTH PERSONAL AND

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:11.981
HISTORICAL INFORMATION. IN

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:15.318
TERMS OF PERSONAL, I'LL SHARE

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:16.953
THAT AT THE AGE OF THREE YEARS

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.922
OLD, I STARTED READING. I WAS

00:59:18.988 --> 00:59:21.324
IN A NUMBER OF GIFTED AND

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.426
TALENTED EDUCATION PROGRAMS,

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:27.797
AND AT THE AGE OF 13, THAT THE

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:29.999
TREATMENT TOWARDS ME IN PUBLIC,

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:32.201
THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:34.137
CHANGED, WHERE I HAD A PARENT

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.773
THAT WAS TERMINALLY ILL AND

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:40.810
THEY ENDED UP PASSING AWAY

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:43.146
DURING MY TEENAGE YEARS. AND SO

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:44.847
AT THE AGE OF 13, I WAS

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:46.983
EXPELLED FROM JUNIOR HIGH

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:50.153
SCHOOL. I WAS MADE AN EXAMPLE

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:51.921
OF AND UNDERSTOOD AT THAT YOUNG

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:53.690
AGE OF WHAT RACIAL PROFILING

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:56.159
WAS, WHERE EVERY NATIVE

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:58.127
AMERICAN CHILD THAT WAS IN THAT

00:59:58.194 --> 00:59:59.996
SCHOOL WAS BROUGHT IN FOR

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.564
QUESTIONING, HAD THEIR LOCKERS

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:02.799
SEARCHED. MY PARENTS WERE TOLD

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:04.100
THAT I WOULD NEVER ATTEND

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.069
ANOTHER PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.804
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN. I

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.405
WAS AGAIN EXPELLED AT THE AGE

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:11.708
OF 15, WHEN MY FATHER

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.609
ULTIMATELY ENDED UP PASSING

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:17.146
AWAY. AND SO THOSE WERE SOME OF

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:18.915
THE CHALLENGES WHERE I

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:20.183
ULTIMATELY WAS ABLE TO TEST OUT

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:21.818
WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.119
PROFICIENCY EXAM, START WORKING

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.254
FULL TIME AT THE AGE OF 17, AND

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:29.258
WENT ON TO TAKE MY GED SO THAT

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:31.361
I COULD ENROLL IN PRIVATE

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:33.997
COLLEGE. I WANT TO SHARE ALSO

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.932
ABOUT MY SON, UCHI, WHO WILL BE

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:38.768
A SENIOR THIS YEAR AT THE AGE

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.970
OF SEVEN YEARS OLD. IN FIRST

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:42.171
GRADE, HE WAS PHYSICALLY

01:00:42.238 --> 01:00:44.107
ASSAULTED BY HIS TEACHER. HE

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:45.875
WAS STANDING UP WITH HIS LONG

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:47.677
HAIR. ONE OF THE ONLY INDIAN

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.045
BOYS IN HIS SCHOOL. DIDN'T PUT

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:50.179
AWAY HIS HOMEWORK QUICKLY

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:51.914
ENOUGH. WHEN THE BELL RANG AND

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.050
HIS TEACHER CAME UP AND HIT HIM

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.052
IN HIS ARM, WHERE THERE WAS A

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.854
DOCUMENTED PHYSICAL CONTUSION

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.057
IN HIS ARM, WHICH LED TO THE

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:04.127
WHICH LED TO A NATIONAL INQUIRY.

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.795
IN TERMS OF THE RACIAL

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:08.698
DISCRIMINATION, WHERE MY FRIENDS

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:10.733
CHILDREN'S WERE TELLING

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.068
MY CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:13.669
WORKED FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:15.004
THAT THEIR PARENTS WERE SAYING

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:16.973
THAT THEY COULD ONLY HAVE WHITE

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.174
FRIENDS, THAT IT WAS WHITE

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:19.876
FRIENDS ONLY. AND THIS WAS JUST

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:22.011
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND SO

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:24.080
THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:24.914
PERSONAL REASONS WHY WE

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.316
CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK AND

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:29.819
WHY WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:31.654
THE ISSUES THAT ARE OUR

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.022
CHILDREN FACE. BECAUSE THESE

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.958
ARE MY OWN CHILDREN THAT HAVE

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:37.693
CONTINUED TO TO FACE THESE

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.962
CHALLENGES. SO I WANTED TO TALK

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.697
ABOUT THE HISTORY AND LEGACY

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:42.932
THAT CALIFORNIA'S MISSION

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:44.233
SYSTEM AND FEDERAL BOARDING

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.269
SCHOOLS, HOW THEY TRY TO ERASE

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:47.970
US, THAT TODAY'S SCHOOLS STILL

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.906
CARRY THOSE SAME STRUCTURES

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.841
THAT MAKE NATIVE STUDENTS

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.810
INVISIBLE. I SAY EVERY DAY, AS

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.145
A CALIFORNIA INDIAN WOMAN IS A

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:56.913
FIGHT AGAINST INVISIBILITY.

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:59.015
IT'S A FIGHT AGAINST ERASURE

01:01:59.082 --> 01:01:59.916
THAT THESE STRUCTURES PERSIST

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:01.884
IN TODAY'S SCHOOLS, WHERE

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.453
NATIVE STUDENTS ARE STILL TOO

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:05.154
OFTEN TREATED AS OUTSIDERS

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.055
INSTEAD OF EMBRACED AS INTEGRAL

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:08.724
TO CALIFORNIA'S STORY AS THE

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:11.094
MIRACLES THAT THEY ARE WITH THE

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.128
BOARDING SCHOOL TO PRISON

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:13.763
PIPELINE THAT OUR KIDS ARE

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.897
SUSPENDED, EXPELLED AND

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:17.433
ARRESTED AT HIGHER RATES, THEY

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.034
ARE PUSHED OUT OF CLASSROOMS

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:20.036
AND INTO CAGES INSTEAD OF BEING

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:22.205
SUPPORTED, TO LEARN AND TO LEAD,

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:23.906
THAT THESE POLICIES AND

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:26.008
PRACTICES PUSH OUR YOUTH OUT OF

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:26.776
THE CLASSROOM AND INTO THE

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:28.878
BOARDING SCHOOL TO PRISON

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.513
PIPELINE. INSTEAD OF CREATING

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.781
SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE LEARNING

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:34.117
ENVIRONMENTS, NATIVE STUDENTS

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:36.486
DON'T DROP OUT. AS WE HEARD

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:37.420
FROM BELLA'S EXPERIENCE,

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.055
SCHOOLS PUSH THEM OUT BY

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.723
FAILING TO MAKE THEM FEEL SAFE,

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:41.958
SEEN AND CELEBRATED. THAT

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:44.026
GRADUATION REGALIA LEGISLATION

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.195
IS JUST ONE STEP TOWARDS REAL

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.364
BELONGING, AS AFFIRMED IN

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.833
PENDING LEGISLATION WITH AB

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.735
2337. THIS IS ONE STEP TOWARDS

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.770
AFFIRMING CULTURAL IDENTITY,

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:56.072
BUT IT MUST BE PAIRED WITH

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:57.006
DEEPER INVESTMENTS IN

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.375
CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE EDUCATION

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.176
WITH NATIVE EDUCATORS AND

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:02.778
STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES THAT

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:03.846
INVESTMENT IN CULTURE AND

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:05.882
CLIMATE THAT WE NEED MORE THAN

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:07.750
SYMBOLIC CHANGE. WE NEED REAL

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:09.352
INVESTMENT IN NATIVE EDUCATORS,

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.887
CULTURALLY GROUNDED CURRICULUM,

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:12.855
AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE THAT

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:15.391
HEALS INSTEAD OF PUNISHES OUR

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.792
TRIBAL YOUTH. THIS MEANS

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:18.928
EXPANDING NATIVE STUDIES

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.196
CURRICULUM, HIRING NATIVE

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:21.864
EDUCATORS AND COUNSELORS, AND

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.533
CREATING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.067
PROGRAMS THAT HEAL INSTEAD OF

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:27.937
PUNISH AS A VISION FOR SUCCESS.

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:29.505
WHEN NATIVE STUDENTS THRIVE,

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:30.740
ALL OF CALIFORNIA THRIVES.

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.575
INVESTING IN NATIVE STUDENTS

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.076
SUCCESS IS INVESTING IN THE

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:35.845
FUTURE OF THIS STATE THAT WE

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.079
MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:38.581
POLICIES THAT DISMANTLE

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.850
SYSTEMIC RACISM IN SCHOOLS,

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.985
UPLIFT TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY IN

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:43.920
EDUCATION, AND ENSURE THAT

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:46.022
EVERY NATIVE STUDENT IS NOT

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:47.690
JUST SURVIVING, BUT THRIVING AS

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:53.256
THAT WENT HIKING, AND JUST TO

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:54.257
HAVE ALL OF THE CHILDREN THERE

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:55.858
IN THE YOUTH ABLE TO

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:58.194
PARTICIPATE IN THEIR TRIBAL

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.695
ACTIVITIES AND BE TOGETHER IN A

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:02.231
WAY THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.000
FEEL SUPPORTED ON THE OUTSIDE.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:04.834
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN BUSY

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.836
WITH THIS WEEK, AND WE'RE JUST

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.371
VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR TIME.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.905
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:12.575
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AS NOW WE

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:15.645
GO TO JANET KAY, BILL HALEY,

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:18.481
HALEY, HALEY AND PEDRO. THANK

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.216
YOU TO THE HONORABLE ASSEMBLY

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:22.184
MEMBER RAMOS AND THE SELECT

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:22.918
COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.420
AFFAIRS FOR INVITING ME TO

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:26.055
SPEAK, AND, OF COURSE, TO THE

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:26.956
TABLE MOUNTAIN RANCHERIA FOR

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:28.824
HOSTING THIS HISTORIC HEARING

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:31.093
HELD ON TRIBAL LANDS. APPEARING

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.795
BEFORE YOU TODAY IS NOT JUST A

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:34.497
MOMENT IN MY OWN JOURNEY. IT

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:35.264
REFLECTS GENERATIONS OF OUR

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:36.732
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.000
EDUCATION COULD BE POWERFUL,

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:40.770
EVEN THOUGH FOR MANY IT WAS

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:41.971
EXPERIENCED IN SYSTEMS THAT DID

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:44.507
NOT HONOR WHO WE ARE. FOR SOME

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:45.875
IN MY FAMILY, SCHOOL WAS NOT A

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:48.477
PLACE OF SAFETY OR INSPIRATION.

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.112
IT WAS AN INSTITUTION OF PAIN,

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:52.581
A REMINDER OF THE ATROCITIES

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:53.215
COMMITTED AGAINST NATIVE PEOPLE

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:55.851
IN THE NAME OF EDUCATION. OUR

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:58.287
HISTORY INCLUDES RELATIVES WHO

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.122
WERE SHAMED FOR TRIBAL IDENTITY

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:01.857
AND WHO WERE TOLD IN WORD AND

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.859
IN ACTION THAT BEING NATIVE WAS

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:06.062
SOMETHING TO HIDE. THOSE

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:07.163
EXPERIENCES DID NOT HAPPEN

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:09.298
CENTURIES AGO IN FARAWAY

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:10.499
BOARDING SCHOOLS. THESE

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:11.701
INJUSTICES HAPPENED IN PUBLIC

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:14.103
CLASSROOMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA,

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.471
WITHIN LIVING MEMORY OF OUR

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:18.941
ELDERS. MY OWN JOURNEY BEGAN

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:20.076
DIFFERENTLY BEFORE I EVER

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.178
ENTERED A PUBLIC SCHOOL. MY

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:23.045
FIRST TEACHER WAS MY MOTHER AND

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:25.181
A TRIBAL HEAD START CLASSROOM

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:26.749
ON TRIBAL LANDS, SURROUNDED BY

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.718
TRIBAL CHILDREN. WITH TRIBAL

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:30.753
CULTURE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.954
THE CURRICULUM. THOSE EARLY

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:34.290
YEARS WERE MORE THAN

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:34.990
PREPARATION FOR KINDERGARTEN.

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.192
THEY WERE MY FIRST EXPERIENCE

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:38.327
OF LEARNING IN AN ENVIRONMENT

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:38.961
THAT REFLECTED WHO I WAS, WHERE

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:41.230
OUR CULTURE WAS AFFIRMED, AND

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:42.965
WHERE EDUCATION WAS GROUNDED IN

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.934
CARE AND RESPECT. THAT

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.068
FOUNDATION GAVE ME THE

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:47.636
CONFIDENCE TO SEE EDUCATION AS

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:50.005
A PATHWAY, NOT A BARRIER. BUT

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:51.807
WHEN I GRADUATED FROM THE LOCAL

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.809
PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT, I SAW

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.077
HOW MANY NATIVE STUDENTS AROUND

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.312
ME DID NOT HAVE THAT SAME

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:58.914
SUPPORT. RESOURCES WERE LIMITED,

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.950
CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING WAS RARE,

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:02.752
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGHER

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:05.020
EDUCATION WAS UNCERTAIN. EVEN

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:06.822
WHEN I WAS APPLYING TO COLLEGES,

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.291
I WAS NOT ENCOURAGED TO SET MY

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:09.992
SIGHTS ON ELITE UNIVERSITIES.

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:11.827
DESPITE HAVING STRONG GRADES,

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:14.630
COMMUNITY SERVICE AND EXTENSIVE

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.165
EXTRACURRICULARS, HIGH SCHOOL

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:17.333
STAFF HELD LOW EXPECTATIONS OF

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.200
NATIVE STUDENTS AND BELIEVED IT

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:19.802
WAS RARE FOR US TO PURSUE

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.972
COLLEGE AT ALL. AND ONCE I WAS

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:23.639
ADMITTED TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY,

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.007
IT WAS IMPLIED I WAS ONLY

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:26.675
ADMITTED BECAUSE I WAS NATIVE.

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:28.677
MY PRESENCE SIMPLY CHECKED A

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.880
BOX FOR THE UNIVERSITY. THESE

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:32.114
EXPERIENCES SHOW HOW NATIVE

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:33.182
STUDENTS ARE TOO OFTEN

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:34.817
UNDERESTIMATED IN HIGH SCHOOL,

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.719
AND THEN UNDERVALUED ONCE THEY

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.220
REACH HIGHER EDUCATION, BOTH BY

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:40.256
ADMINISTRATORS AND THEIR PEERS.

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.757
WHAT CARRIED ME FORWARD WERE

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:44.260
THE STORIES OF MY PEOPLE, THE

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:45.494
ENCOURAGEMENT OF MY FAMILY, AND

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:46.862
THE DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:47.997
MOST OF EVERY CLASSROOM I

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:51.367
ENTERED TO LEARN, TO GROW, AND

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:52.368
TO SPEAK WITH COURAGE, EVEN

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:54.236
WHEN IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BE

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:56.939
HEARD. THAT PATH TOOK ME FROM A

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:59.008
SMALL TOWN HIGH SCHOOL TO

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.075
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, WHERE I

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:01.343
EARNED BOTH MY UNDERGRADUATE

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.344
AND GRADUATE DEGREES, AND THEN

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.046
TO LAW SCHOOL WITH A

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:05.815
SPECIALIZATION IN INDIAN LAW.

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.116
ALONG THE WAY, I BECAME AN

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:08.717
ATTORNEY, SERVED ON TRIBAL

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:09.985
COUNCIL, AND TODAY HAVE THE

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:10.986
PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.555
DIRECTOR FOR THE OFFICE OF

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:14.223
NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS AT THE

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.157
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.026
JUSTICE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF

01:08:17.092 --> 01:08:18.794
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB BONTA.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.029
EACH STEP TAUGHT ME NOT ONLY

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:22.064
THE VALUE OF EDUCATION, BUT

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:22.798
ALSO THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:25.167
COMES WITH IT. EDUCATION GAVE

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.936
ME THE TOOLS TO BE AN ADVOCATE,

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.404
TO SPEAK WITH CONFIDENCE IN

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:30.539
COURTROOMS, CLASSROOMS AND

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:31.907
COUNCIL CHAMBERS, AND TO STAND

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:34.043
UP FOR OUR PEOPLE, FROM OUR

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:35.678
CHILDREN TO OUR ELDERS, SO THAT

01:08:35.744 --> 01:08:37.112
EVERY GENERATION IS SUPPORTED

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.948
AND PROTECTED. THIS IS WHY

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.783
TRIBAL EDUCATION IS SO VITAL.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.084
IT DOES MORE THAN PREPARE US

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:44.153
FOR JOBS OR DEGREES. EDUCATION

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.522
PREPARES US TO BE LEADERS AND

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:48.190
ADVOCATES, INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:49.592
BRING FORWARD PRIORITIES,

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.860
DEFEND SOVEREIGNTY, AND ENSURE

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:51.994
THE SURVIVAL AND STRENGTH OF

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:54.830
OUR NATIONS. IN MY NEW ROLE, I

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:57.500
SEE EVERY DAY HOW EDUCATION,

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:58.667
JUSTICE AND SOVEREIGNTY ARE

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.002
DEEPLY CONNECTED. OUR OFFICE

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.971
SERVES AS A BRIDGE ADVISING THE

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.939
ATTORNEY GENERAL, FOSTERING

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.407
TRUST BETWEEN THE STATE AND

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.041
TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS, AND

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:07.176
CREATING SPACE FOR NATIVE

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.777
LEADERSHIP IN SHAPING POLICY

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:10.513
AND JUSTICE THROUGHOUT

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:12.348
CALIFORNIA. TRUE PROGRESS COMES

01:09:12.414 --> 01:09:13.883
WHEN WE BRING FORWARD OUR

01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:15.150
PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERTISE,

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:16.986
WITH EDUCATION SERVING AS ONE

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:18.821
OF MANY TOOLS THAT BUILD

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:20.122
CAPACITY, FOSTER LEADERSHIP,

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.724
AND EMPOWER ADVOCACY ACROSS

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.393
INDIAN COUNTRY. WHEN WE SUPPORT

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.694
TRIBAL EDUCATION, WE ARE NOT

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:26.795
ONLY HELPING INDIVIDUAL

01:09:26.862 --> 01:09:27.997
STUDENTS SUCCEED, WE ARE

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.366
STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNITIES,

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:30.933
PRESERVING OUR CULTURE, AND

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.235
PREPARING THE NEXT GENERATION

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:34.537
TO WALK INTO EVERY SPACE FROM

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:36.005
CLASSROOMS TO COUNCIL CHAMBERS,

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:37.973
FROM COURTROOMS TO LEGISLATIVE

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.975
HEARINGS, READY TO ADVOCATE AND

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:42.678
DRIVE MEANINGFUL CHANGE. MY

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.280
JOURNEY FROM A TRIBAL HEAD

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.148
START CLASSROOM WITH MY MOTHER

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:46.982
AS MY FIRST TEACHER, TO

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.784
STANFORD, TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.019
AND NOW SERVING IN THE ATTORNEY

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:51.987
GENERAL'S OFFICE, IS PROOF THAT

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:52.855
NATIVE STUDENTS CAN THRIVE AT

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:55.925
THE HIGHEST LEVELS. WHEN WE ARE

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:57.493
SUPPORTED, THE QUESTION IS NOT

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.060
WHETHER NATIVE STUDENTS ARE

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:00.162
READY TO SUCCEED, BUT WHETHER

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:01.797
WE WILL ENSURE THAT EQUITY AND

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.933
INCLUSION THAT MAKES SUCCESS NO

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.734
LONGER THE EXCEPTION, BUT THE

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:07.903
RULE. MITCH, THANK YOU FOR THE

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.672
HONOR OF SHARING MY STORY. I

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:10.873
STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.941
QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.008
HAVE, AND TO SERVE AS A

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:37.052
SUPPORTING THEM ON THE OUTSIDE,

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:40.022

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:56.739

WANT OUR EDUCATORS TO TO LOOK

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:05.914
LIKE US, TO KNOW OUR CULTURE.

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.816
AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG POINT

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.118
AS WELL. AND I THINK TO MISS

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:10.919

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.691
ABOUT. AND OBVIOUSLY, IN YOUR

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:18.293
SON'S EXPERIENCE, WHAT DO WE

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.194
NEED TO DO TO, I THINK

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.796
INCENTIVIZE. AND WE HAD A

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.164
HEARING LAST WEEK ABOUT EVEN AT

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.398
THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF EDUCATION

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:25.868
HERE IN THE STATE, THE UC

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:28.003
SYSTEM REALLY GETTING MORE

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:31.406
TRIBAL LEADERS, NATIVES WITHIN

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:34.076
LEADERSHIP THERE TO LEAD

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.344
REPATRIATION PROGRAMS, WHICH

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:37.212
CURRENTLY, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:39.815
FALLING FAR SHORT ON DOING THAT.

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:41.683
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:45.554
TO MAKE YOUR JOURNEY AND FUTURE

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:48.891
STUDENTS JOURNEYS A LOT BETTER?

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:52.161
FROM A, I THINK, REPRESENTATION

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:52.861
STANDPOINT, BECAUSE I DON'T

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:54.663
THINK A LOT OF YOU, BEYOND YOUR

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:55.898
MOTHER BEING YOUR FIRST TEACHER

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:57.065
IN THAT FIRST HEAD START

01:13:57.132 --> 01:14:01.136
PROGRAM, HOW DO WE GET MORE

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:03.972
NATIVES INTO THESE POSITIONS OF

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:06.475
POWER, AND ESPECIALLY AS OUR

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.110
EDUCATORS? BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:10.946
WILL HELP SOLVE A LOT OF THE

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.748
ISSUES ON THE GROUND LEVEL AND

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:16.051
MAKE EVERYONE I THINK WHEN WE

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:19.822
TALK ABOUT EQUITY AND, AND, AND

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:21.056
TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:23.358
ISSUES, I THINK THE POSITIONS

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:24.793
OF POWER ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.261
TO SEE OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:28.197
THERE. SO HOW DO WE DO THAT?

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:30.265
HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE, HOW DO

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:31.333
WE MAKE AND CREATE A PIPELINE

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.335
SO THAT THESE POSITIONS ARE

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.838
ACTUALLY FILLED BY FOLKS FROM

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:48.984
YOUR COMMUNITIES? SORRY, I WAS

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:52.654
DEBATING ON WHO'S GOING FIRST.

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.823
IT'S I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:56.191
OTHER SIDE OF THINGS. RIGHT.

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:58.026
I'VE BEEN A STUDENT MY WHOLE

01:14:58.093 --> 01:14:59.528
LIFE, AND I JUST GRADUATED LATE

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:01.029
MAY. AND SO BEING A TITLE SIX

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:03.131
STUDENT MY WHOLE LIFE, I WENT

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:04.333
TO MY FIRST INDIAN EDITOR

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:05.200
MEETING IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.102
YEAR AND HAD NO IDEA THAT

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.270
INDIAN STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.005
INVITED TO INDIAN EDITOR

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.173
MEETINGS, WHICH IS SOMETHING

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.842
THAT IS NOT. THERE'S NO

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:16.011
OUTREACH THERE. THERE'S NOBODY

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:16.845
TELLING NATIVE STUDENTS, HEY,

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:17.946
YOU SHOULD COME TO THESE

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.514
MEETINGS. HEY, YOU SHOULD SPEAK

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:20.649
ABOUT ANY ISSUES THERE. THERE

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:21.917
IS NO COMMUNICATION, AT LEAST

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:23.919
AT THE, YOU KNOW, THE SCHOOL

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.087
AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT I

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:26.922
WAS IN. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT

01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:28.957
THAT'S A PROBLEM THERE TOO, AS

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:32.895
WELL AS THE THE TITLE SIX

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:33.829
COMMITTEE AND THOSE, THOSE

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:35.797
WOMEN AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.165
IN POWER THERE, TOO. I ALSO

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.334
REACHED OUT TO MULTIPLE,

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:39.968
MULTIPLE TIMES REGARDING ISSUES

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:42.204
THAT I WAS FACING AT MY SCHOOL

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.673
WASN'T JUST PERTAINING TO

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.341
GRADUATION, BUT MY FOCUS WAS

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:49.177
GRADUATION, AND THAT OUR NATIVE

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:51.079
STUDENTS DON'T ONLY MATTER WHEN

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.714
IT'S NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.283
MONTH, WHEN IT'S INDIGENOUS

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.884
PEOPLES DAY, WHEN THEY'RE

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:57.185
GRADUATING, RIGHT? THEY MATTER

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:58.320
EVERY SINGLE DAY OF EVERY

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.989
SINGLE, EVERY YEAR. AND SO,

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:02.291
UNFORTUNATELY, THESE PEOPLE

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.059
THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH IN THE

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:06.762
IN THE SCHOOL THAT I WAS IN AND

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.230
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT I WAS

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:10.098
IN WOULD OFTENTIMES TOKENIZE ME

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:11.867
FOR BEING THE ONLY NATIVE

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.702
AMERICAN STUDENT. AND THERE

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.637
WERE SEVERAL OCCASIONS,

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:17.039
OCCASIONS THAT MY COUSIN AND I

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:18.941
WERE ASKED SEVERAL TIMES IF WE

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.742
WOULD GO OUT OF OUR WAY FOR

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:24.012
THESE NON-INDIAN PEOPLE JUST TO

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.714
REPRESENT. THAT WAY THEY CAN

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:26.982
CHECK THEIR BOXES AND SAY, YEP,

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.117
WE DID THIS BECAUSE IT'S NATIVE

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.786
AMERICAN, WHATEVER. AND SO

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:33.689
OFTENTIMES I THINK I NEEDED I

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:34.923
NEEDED SOMEONE TO COME IN,

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.359
RIGHT? I NEEDED AN ADULT TO BE

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:38.260
IN THE ROOM BECAUSE THEY

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.895
WEREN'T GOING TO LISTEN TO ME.

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:42.064
I WAS I WAS 16 AT THE TIME WHEN

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:44.066
I STARTED THE FIGHT WITH MY

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.000
SCHOOL AND MY SCHOOL DISTRICT,

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:47.169
AND I'M 18 NOW. BUT TWO YEARS

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:49.004
AGO AND EVEN NOW, THEY THEY

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:51.773
STILL WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.941
AND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE YEAR.

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:55.143
THAT'S WHY I HAD SAID THAT I, I

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:55.911
HAD FELT INVISIBLE BECAUSE, I

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:57.980
MEAN, WHO IS BELLA GARCIA,

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.982
RIGHT? OH, SHE'S JUST SHE SAYS

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:00.782
SHE'S CALIFORNIA INDIAN, BUT

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.050
THEY DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.952
CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE. SO IT

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:05.821
WAS JUST LIKE THAT. I DID IT

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:07.289
MATTER? SO IF THERE WAS

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:08.490
SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN THOSE

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:09.791
MEETINGS WITH ME OR WHO WOULD

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:11.860
ATTEND, OR SOMEBODY WHO WOULD

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:13.929
EVEN THE TITLE SIX PEOPLE, THEY

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:14.963
THEY DON'T COME OUT TO SCHOOLS.

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:17.366
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:19.101
OUTREACH WITH NATIVE STUDENTS.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:19.901
CLOVIS UNIFIED THIS PAST YEAR

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:23.271
HAD 574, I BELIEVE, ENROLLED

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:25.307
TITLE SIX STUDENTS AND NEVER,

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:27.209
FROM WHAT I KNOW, NEVER REACHED

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:28.877
OUT TO ANY THAT WERE ON MY

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:31.046
CAMPUS AT MY HIGH SCHOOL. AND

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:31.947
THAT WAS MY JUNIOR AND MY

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:34.850
SENIOR YEAR THAT I HAD REALLY

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:37.619
STARTED DOING A LOT OF THE

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.787
GROUNDWORK FOR GRADUATING,

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:40.689
WEARING TRIBAL REGALIA. AND,

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:44.059
YOU KNOW, BEING ONE OF ONLY ONE

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:46.094
OF FOUR NATIVE SENIORS WAS

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.863
REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT. AND

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:50.432
EVEN ONLY HAVING FOUR SENIORS

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:52.834
AT MY HIGH SCHOOL, I

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:54.102
UNFORTUNATELY, I COULD NOT RELY

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:56.905
ON THE TITLE. THE TITLE SIX

01:17:56.972 --> 01:18:00.075
INDIAN COMMITTEE FOR ONE AND

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:00.942
THEN TWO. THOSE WOMEN WHO

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:03.478
THAT'S THEIR JOB, YOU KNOW,

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:04.713
THEIR JOB IS SUPPLEMENTARY

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.015
SERVICES TO LOOK AFTER TITLE

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:08.784
SIX STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF. AND

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.852
THEN THE OTHER SENIORS WHO

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.387
GRADUATED FROM MY SCHOOL. SO I

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:13.789
DEFINITELY THINK THAT IF WE

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:16.591
WERE ABLE TO FIX THAT SOMEHOW,

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.392
THAT WOULD DEFINITELY CLOSE

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:22.164
THAT GAP. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.799
HEARING FROM ALL OF OUR STORIES

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:24.933
IS JUST FINDING THAT PLACE OF

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.069
BELONGING, ENSURING THAT WE ARE

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:27.969
SEEING PEOPLE LIKE US IN THOSE

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:30.072
POSITIONS. IF YOU CAN HEAR FROM

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:31.873
MY STORY, I MADE IT A POINT TO

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.909
SAY MY FIRST START WAS ON

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.110
TRIBAL LANDS WITH TRIBAL

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:37.379
CHILDREN, WITH A FULLY

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:38.013
INTEGRATED CULTURAL CURRICULUM

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.015
THAT REALLY SET THE FOUNDATION

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.983
FOR THE REST OF MY EDUCATION. I

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.785
WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT I ALSO

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:45.754
WENT TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY,

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:46.955
WHICH HAS A STRONG NATIVE

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:48.123
AMERICAN COMMUNITY, WITH THE

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.291
STANFORD AMERICAN INDIAN

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:50.859
ORGANIZATION. SO I WAS VERY

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:52.060
SUPPORTED THERE. AND THEN AT

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:53.795
LAW SCHOOL, I WENT TO ARIZONA

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:54.930
STATE UNIVERSITY, WHICH HAS

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:57.132
ONCE AGAIN AN AMAZING INDIAN

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.733
LEGAL PROGRAM WHO CONTINUE TO

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.869
ENSURE THAT ANYTIME I WAS GOING

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:02.070
THROUGH STRUGGLES OR I NEEDED

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:03.338
ASSISTANCE OR I NEEDED TO MAKE

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:04.906
CONNECTIONS, THEY WERE THERE TO

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:06.208
HELP ME. THEY WERE THERE TO

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:08.844
SUPPORT ME. BUT AGAIN, THAT IS

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.045
ALMOST THE EXCEPTION. THAT IS

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:11.780
NOT THE RULE. SO ENSURING THAT

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:13.014
AS STATE LEGISLATORS THAT

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:14.916
YOU'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:15.717
CREATING THOSE PIPELINES, AS

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:17.886
YOU CALLED THEM, FOR US, NOT

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.187
ONLY TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:21.356
EDUCATION SYSTEM, BUT THEN TO

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:22.824
FIND A JOB AFTER. SO THOSE ARE

01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:25.794
SOME OF THE THINGS. FOLLOW UP.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:27.996
I JUST WANTED TO ADD QUICKLY

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:29.698
THAT WE PARTNER WITH SAN

01:19:29.764 --> 01:19:31.366
FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.268
DISTRICT INDIAN EDUCATION

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.937
PROGRAM, AND THE DIRECTOR'S

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:38.006
POSITION WAS CUT. THIS YEAR.

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:39.908
SHE'S NO LONGER THERE. AND SO

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:43.311
IT'S BEEN INTEGRATED IN WITH

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:46.014
ALL OF THE THERE WAS LOTS OF

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:48.416
ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMING AND,

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:51.286
AND THOSE POSITIONS WERE WERE

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:54.356
CUT THROUGH THE NEW LEADERSHIP

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:57.425
CHANGES WITH THE CITY AND

01:19:57.492 --> 01:19:58.793
COUNTY GOVERNMENTS. AND SO

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.029
THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE THAT WE

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:01.863
ARE STILL CONTINUING TO WORK

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.832
WITH AND SUPPORT INDIAN

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.800
EDUCATION FOR, FOR SAN

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:06.835
FRANCISCO. WE'VE TAKEN THE

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.236
STUDENTS TO ALCATRAZ ISLAND.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:10.071
WE'VE DONE OUR OWN KIND OF

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:10.839
EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHERE WE'RE

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:13.208
SUPPORTING THE ETHNIC STUDIES

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:15.043
TEACHERS, BUT THERE'S

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.944
DEFINITELY ISSUES AROUND AROUND

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:19.848
FUNDING CUTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:23.385
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. THANK

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:24.819
YOU, MR. CHAIR. THERE WAS A

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.688
THEME THAT WAS PRESENT THROUGH

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:27.989
EACH ONE OF YOUR TESTIMONIES

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:30.926
HERE TODAY. BELLA, YOU SAID

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:31.927
THAT AS THE ONLY CHILD, YOU

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:34.930
FELT ALONE AND INVISIBLE.

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.565
MORNING STAR, YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:38.400
THAT FIGHT AGAINST INVISIBILITY.

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:40.435
AND JANET, YOU TALKED ABOUT OUR

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.804
HISTORY. BEING THAT NATIVE IS

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.206
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:45.807
HIDDEN. AT SOME POINT. YOU

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:47.876
FOUND THAT GRIT, THAT

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:50.345
DETERMINATION THAT YOU SPOKE

01:20:50.412 --> 01:21:08.697

AND IT'S LEADING ME BACK TO

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:42.063
SOMETHING THAT BELLA YOU SAID I

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:45.133
WANT TO MAKE SURE IS ECHOED AND

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.302

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:57.812
THOSE OF YOU WHO I WILL ASK TO

01:21:57.879 --> 01:22:00.482

WOMEN LEADERS. WE DON'T NEED TO

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:07.122
BE INVISIBLE ANY LONGER. YOU

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:08.923
NEED TO OWN YOUR TRUTHS IN

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.126
EVERY SINGLE ROOM THAT YOU GO

01:22:11.192 --> 01:22:13.295
INTO. AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.030
YOU HEARD FROM THOSE OF US WHO

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:15.864
ARE SITTING HERE NOW, HOW

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.801
VALUABLE IT IS, HOW NECESSARY

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.836
IT IS, AND HOW WITH

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:24.039
DETERMINATION YOU WILL GET HERE.

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:27.976
I WILL TAKE A MOMENT IF I CAN.

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:29.711
MR. CHAIR, I WANT TO TALK TO

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.380
FRED BEAN, WHO IS FROM

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:34.616
NORTHFORK. I LEARNED SOMETHING

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:38.086
YESTERDAY. BEING IN THE

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.821
LEGISLATURE. I PRACTICED

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:42.057
MEDICINE FOR TEN YEARS, AND IT

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:46.061
WAS. I WON'T OUT WHO IN THIS

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.797
ROOM WAS IN NEED OF MEDICAL

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:50.065
ATTENTION. BUT THEY SPOKE ABOUT

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:52.834
A NATURAL REMEDY, ONE THAT I

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:54.903
NEEDED TO HEAR AND ONE THAT WE

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:58.173
CAN ALL BENEFIT FROM AS WE ARE

01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:59.007

I'M LOOKING TO MANY OF YOU TO

WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.054
THOSE INSTITUTIONS TO MAKE SURE

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:16.157
THAT WE'RE STUDYING, THAT WE'RE

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.192
ENGINEERING AND THAT WE'RE

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:19.694
BECOMING ENTREPRENEURS. YOU

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:23.365
SHOULD BE FIGURING OUT HOW THE

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:24.966
REMEDIES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENT

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.502
ON YOUR NATIONS FOR CENTURIES.

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:30.071
WE'RE ABLE TO NOW TURN AROUND

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:32.741
WITH US IN THOSE MEDICAL

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.008
SCHOOLS, BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:36.978
AND TO WORK ON THEM. FINALLY, I

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:38.279
WILL JUST MENTION THE

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:39.981
INCREDIBLE WORK THAT'S BEING

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:40.915
DONE HERE AT FRESNO STATE.

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:42.851
SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.085
EDUCATION AND THE NEED FOR US

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:46.788
TO DO REPATRIATION, WE'VE BEEN

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.022
WORKING VERY CLOSELY. CHAIRMAN,

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.691
WITH SAUL JIMENEZ SANDOVAL, AND

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.926
WE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:54.095
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO ALL THAT'S

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.163
NECESSARY TO WORK WITH EACH ONE

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.098
OF THESE TRIBAL NATIONS. THANK

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:59.768
YOU ALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH,

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:02.303
ASSEMBLY MEMBER VALENCIA. THANK

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:05.240
YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, AND SO MUCH

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.375
APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY THAT

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:09.878
YOU'VE ALL PROVIDED TO US TODAY.

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:12.680
I HAVE A LONG STANDING

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:14.949
RELATIONSHIP WITH EDUCATION. I

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:18.052
WAS NEVER THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:20.255
STUDENT GROWING UP. I, I

01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:21.589
FOCUSED ON SPORTS, WHICH IS

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:23.858
WHAT ACTUALLY ALLOWED ME TO

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:26.728
STAY FOCUSED ON SCHOOLING AND,

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:30.031
AND HAD ME GRADUATE. MY WIFE IS

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.266
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL

01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:32.066
BACK HOME IN THE DISTRICT I

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:33.234
REPRESENT IN CENTRAL ORANGE

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:34.769
COUNTY. MY MOTHER WORKED FOR

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:37.906
ALMOST 30 YEARS FOR THE ANAHEIM

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:39.707
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:41.943
CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. SO

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.211
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:44.746
CONVERSATIONS AROUND EDUCATION

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:48.750
IN OUR FAMILY, AND IT IS

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:51.553
DISHEARTENING TO HEAR THAT. MY

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:53.688
EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATION

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.957
THROUGH THE STORIES AND

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:57.091
PERSPECTIVES OF INDIVIDUALS IN

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:59.060
MY FAMILY WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:01.229
TO EDUCATION, ARE NOT REFLECTED

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:03.898
IN YOUR EXPERIENCES, AND THAT

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:05.700
JUST GOES TO SHOW THE GAP THAT

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:08.069
EXISTS STILL TO THIS DAY IN OUR

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:09.304
EDUCATION SYSTEM, RIGHT? THE

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.105
LACK OF FAIRNESS, THE LACK OF

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.908
INCLUSIVITY THAT WAS SHARED,

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:15.076
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IN MY

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:17.979
OPINION, THE INACCURACY IN

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:21.249
EDUCATION. WE OFTEN HEAR THE

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:22.917
SAYING THAT EDUCATION IS

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:24.686
KNOWLEDGE AND POWER, RIGHT? BUT

01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:26.888
WITHOUT IT BEING FAIR, WITHOUT

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:29.023
IT BEING INCLUSIVE AND ACCURATE,

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.893
IT COULD BE MISUSED. AND I

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.928
THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A VERY

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:36.865
CANDID CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:38.800
PARTICULAR DIRECTION THAT WE'RE

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:42.003
MOVING IN. AND WE MAY HAVE TO

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:43.771
PAUSE. WE MAY HAVE TO TAKE A

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:44.973
LATERAL STEP, READJUST TO

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.274
ENSURE THAT MOVING FORWARD,

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:48.109
THESE VOICES ARE INCLUDED AND

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:50.912
WE PROVIDE THE RESOURCES

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.814
NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE PATH

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:53.982
FORWARD. SO AGAIN, THANK YOU

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:57.452
FOR THAT. IT MEANS A LOT. THANK

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.020
YOU SO MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:04.325
AARONS. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:05.493
WAS VERY STRUCK BY THE

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.062
TESTIMONY TODAY. AND JUST TO

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:10.732
QUOTE, I BELIEVE IT WAS JANET

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:13.801
THAT MANY OF THE EXAMPLES GIVEN

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:17.639
IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM IS WAS NOT

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:20.008
A PLACE FOR SAFETY OR

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:23.044
INSPIRATION. AND I THINK THE

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:24.812
STATE OF CALIFORNIA MORE

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:27.181
RECENTLY IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:31.286
THE PAST FEW DECADES, HAVE HAVE

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:33.254
ATTEMPTED TO RIGHT A LOT OF

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:37.025
WRONGS IN OUR HISTORY AND A

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:40.261
FOCUS ON EQUITY AND A FOCUS ON

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:43.998
CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING. AND A

01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:46.267
LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:49.904
THROUGH NEW PROGRAMS AND

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:53.274
OFFICES. AND TO ADDRESS THOSE

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:55.043
GAPS AND OUR AND OUR

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:57.512
EXPERIENCES OF OUR YOUTH. AND

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:59.047
I'M WONDERING, JANET OR ANYONE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:02.450
ELSE ON THE PANEL COULD SORT OF

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:07.689
SPEAK TO, YOU KNOW, THE SORT OF

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:09.190
SOLUTIONS THAT YOU'RE FINDING

01:27:09.257 --> 01:27:11.059
IN YOUR WORK THAT WORK, WORK

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:13.361
BEST. I KNOW A LOT OF THE

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:14.195
CONVERSATIONS WE TALK ABOUT ARE

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:15.029
ADDRESSING THE HISTORIC

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.031
DIVESTMENT OF EDUCATION, THE

01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:21.002
DIVESTMENT OF OF PROGRAMS THAT

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:25.206
WE DO NO WORK. AND GIVEN YOUR

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:27.909
EXPERTISE IN AND YOUR

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:28.977
RESPECTIVE FIELDS, I'M

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:31.746
WONDERING IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO.

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:34.015
THE THINGS THAT YOU DO SEE

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.117
WORKING ON THE GROUND AND

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:38.052
PERHAPS THE THINGS THAT MAYBE

01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:40.788
YOU SEE IN PROGRAMS OR OR

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:43.224
POLICIES THAT YOU HAVE

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.226
EXPERIENCED. BECAUSE SO MUCH OF

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:48.096
OUR POLICY MAKING IS THE, THE

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:50.031
POLICIES, BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.966
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:54.068
FUNDING ISSUES. A LOT OF IT

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:54.836
COMES BACK TO FUNDING, BUT I'M

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.904
WONDERING IF YOU CAN SORT OF

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.206
SPEAK TO IN YOUR EXPERIENCE,

01:27:58.272 --> 01:27:59.907
WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.909
WORKING THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:28:01.976 --> 01:28:02.910
DOUBLING DOWN ON? AND WHAT DO

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:05.213
YOU THINK? PERHAPS WE NEED TO

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:08.016
BE TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:09.817
MAY, YOU KNOW, MAY BE WELL

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.019
INTENTIONED BUT ISN'T QUITE

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:13.087
WORKING THE WAY IN WHICH

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:13.821
POLICYMAKERS HAVE ORIGINALLY

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:15.990
INTENDED, AS WE LOOK TO FIND

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:17.959
SOLUTIONS TO HELP OUR STUDENTS

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:20.695
IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:22.897
THE QUESTION. ONE THING I WOULD

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.232
SAY THAT IS WORKING IS, OF

01:28:24.298 --> 01:28:25.733
COURSE, OUR TRIBAL LEADERS AND

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.168
OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES HERE IN

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:29.504
THE ROOM. I'M SURE MY FELLOW

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:30.905
PANELISTS WILL SPEAK TO THAT AS

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:33.941
WELL. BUT AGAIN, US KNOWING

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.877
WHERE WE NEED TO BE AND HOW WE

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:38.079
CAN SHAPE OUR FUTURE LEADERS IS

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:39.847
MONUMENTAL IN THAT MOVEMENT. SO

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:41.949
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE AT THE

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.217
TABLE, WE ARE IN THOSE

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:45.353
DECISIONS. WHEN YOU'RE THINKING

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:45.920
ABOUT DIFFERENT LEGISLATIONS

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.689
AND PASSING THEM, DOES THIS

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:48.823
ALSO SPEAK TO TRIBAL

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:49.924
COMMUNITIES? HOW IS THIS

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.259
HELPING THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES?

01:28:51.325 --> 01:28:52.326
IF YOU'RE HAVING TRIBAL

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:53.761
ADVISORS, IF YOU'RE HAVING

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:56.064
NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS BE

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:58.232
INTERNS OR EXTERNS IN YOUR

01:28:58.299 --> 01:29:00.068
ORGANIZATIONS, THAT GOES A LONG

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:01.836
WAY. ONE OF THE THINGS I DO SEE,

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:04.072
AND I'M SURE IT'LL BE TALKED

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:05.206
ABOUT MORE, IS FRESNO STATE

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:06.708
UNIVERSITY. WE HAVE KELLY

01:29:06.774 --> 01:29:08.876
CARRILLO HERE, AND I KNOW SHE'S

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.678
ON A PANEL LATER ON, SO I WON'T

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:11.846
SPEAK TOO MUCH TO THAT. BUT

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:13.881
MAKING SURE THAT OUR VOICES ARE

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.450
BEING HEARD AT THAT TOP

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:16.017
LEADERSHIP, NOT ONLY IN OUR

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.252
UNIVERSITIES BUT BEYOND. SO

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:19.087
THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO

01:29:19.153 --> 01:29:20.722
ENSURE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:22.223
DO. ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.859
ASK IS WHEN YOU ARE DOING

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.094
DIFFERENT LEGISLATIONS BETWEEN,

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.062
YOU KNOW, THE STATE, TRIBAL,

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:30.431
FEDERAL, LOCAL LEVELS, WHATEVER

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:33.000
GOVERNMENTS THERE ARE, TRY TO

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:35.203
REFRAIN FROM ASKING TRIBES TO

01:29:35.269 --> 01:29:36.971
WAIVE OUR SOVEREIGNTY. THAT

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:39.173
SEEMS TO BE A BIG ISSUE. IS

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.642
CONTINUING TO ASK FOR THAT

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:42.944
WAIVER. SO I WOULD JUST SAY

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.946
THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

01:29:45.012 --> 01:29:46.080
THAT COULD EVEN MAKE

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.749
LEGISLATION AND MAKE OUR

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:48.983
INITIATIVES PROGRESS EVEN

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.819
FURTHER. AND THE LAST THING I

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:53.287
WOULD SAY IS MAKING SURE THAT

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:55.690
WE ARE HAVING ACCESS TO DATA.

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:57.792
SOME NATIVE AMERICANS ARE

01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:00.061
NATIVE BY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:01.329
OTHER DESCENTS. AND OFTENTIMES

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:04.098
IT IS THE MORE BROADER CATEGORY

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:07.268
THAT WE ARE CLASSIFIED AS, NOT

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:08.069
NATIVE AMERICANS. SO AGAIN,

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:09.804
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DATA, JUST

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.873
LIKE MISSING AND MURDERED

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:13.808
INDIGENOUS PERSONS, THERE'S

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:19.914
DATA GAPS. THANK YOU. BECAUSE

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:22.216
OF MY FOCUS HAS BEEN PERTAINING

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:25.286
AND REGARDING GRADUATION AND

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:27.488
WEARING TRIBAL REGALIA, ONE OF

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:30.057
THE NOT ONLY WAS I CONSTANTLY

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:31.759
TOLD BY MULTIPLE ADMIN AT MY

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:33.828
SCHOOL OF THE CONSTANT THREAT

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.196
OF, YOU KNOW, DON'T EVEN FILL

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.064
OUT THE PAPER, YOU'RE GOING TO

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:39.033
BE DENIED NUMEROUS, NUMEROUS

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.802
TIMES. AND SO THIS PAPER THAT

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.804
ACTUALLY COMES OUT IS WHAT

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:44.138
CLOVIS UNIFIED, MY FAMILY CALLS

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:46.941
IT THE INDIAN PAPER. BUT CLOVIS

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:48.943
UNIFIED HAS AN INFORMANT PAPER.

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.979
AND THIS PAST YEAR, WORKING

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:53.481
WITH THEM, ALONG WITH

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:54.682
INDIGENOUS JUSTICE AND

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:56.217
CALIFORNIA INDIAN LEGAL

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.385
SERVICES, WHERE I HAD MY

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:59.854
ATTORNEY, THEY DELAYED THAT

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:02.323
FORM. AND SO THE CLOSER AND

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:03.758
CLOSER WE GOT TO GRADUATION,

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:05.827
THAT FORM WASN'T OUT. AND IT'S

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.695
THAT FORM THAT EITHER TELLS YOU

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.230
YOU'RE APPROVED OR YOU'RE

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:12.767
DENIED. AND NOT NOT ONLY ARE

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:14.836
THERE ISSUES WITH THAT FORM,

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:16.838
WITH LANGUAGE SUCH AS WHEN OUR

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:18.873
WOMEN WERE OUR BASKET CAPS,

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.074
THAT OUR BASKET CAPS HAVE TO BE

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:22.143
THE SAME COLOR AS THEIR CAP AND

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.444
GOWN. WHEN OUR BASKETS DON'T

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.046
COME NATURALLY, BLUE AND WHITE

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:27.815
AND BURGUNDY AND GOLD. SO I HAD

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:29.951
MET WITH MY ADMIN AND HAD TOLD

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:30.952
THEM THAT I HAD. I HAD ISSUES

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:32.820
WITH THEIR LANGUAGE THAT THEY

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.055
HAD CHOSEN, AND THEY INFORMED

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:35.323
ME THAT THEY WERE DOING THEIR

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:36.057
RESEARCH ABOUT CALIFORNIA

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:37.425
INDIAN PEOPLE, AND THEIR

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:39.093
RESEARCH WAS SIMPLY USING

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.229
GOOGLE AND NOT REACHING OUT TO

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:42.096
ANY OF THE LOCAL TRIBES

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.365
CHAIRMAN, CHAIRWOMAN, OR GOING

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:46.934
TO ANY MUSEUMS THAT WE HAD HERE.

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:50.872
NOT ONLY IS IS THIS FORM A HUGE

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:52.173
BARRIER FOR NATIVE STUDENTS AND

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.708
THEIR FAMILIES THAT THEY HAVE

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:56.010
TO FILL OUT, BUT IT ALSO LIMITS

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:57.879
STUDENTS TO ONLY TWO ITEMS PER

01:31:57.945 --> 01:32:00.047
GRADUATE. BECAUSE I GRADUATED

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:02.650
WEARING A TRIBAL STOOL, A

01:32:02.717 --> 01:32:03.885
BEADED GRADUATION CAP, AND TWO

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:05.052
EAGLE FEATHERS. THAT WAS

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.687
SOMETHING I HAD TO WRITE DOWN

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:09.357
ON THIS FORM. IT'S THAT

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:11.926
LANGUAGE THAT THAT FRIGHTENED

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:13.928
ME, UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE I

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:15.263
DIDN'T HAVE TWO ITEMS BECAUSE

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:17.265
MY FAMILY WAS GIFTING ME MORE

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:19.033
THAN TWO ITEMS, AS OUR FAMILY

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.801
SHOULD BE PROUD OF ALL OF OUR

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:22.336
GRADUATES FOR GRADUATING FROM

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:26.173
THESE INSTITUTIONS, IT WOULD BE.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.576
IT WOULD BE AMAZING TO SEE ALL

01:32:28.643 --> 01:32:29.377
THE SUPER SUPERINTENDENTS FROM

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:30.878
ALL THE SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:32.313
CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A A

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.115
CONFERENCE OF SOME SORT OR

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:35.883
PERTAINING SPECIFICALLY NOT

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:37.518
ONLY TO TRIBAL REGALIA AROUND

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:38.753
GRADUATION, BUT INDIAN

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:42.657
EDUCATION, THE VICE PRINCIPAL,

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:43.190
THE LEARNING DIRECTOR, THE

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:44.892
PRINCIPAL, THE AREA

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:47.495
SUPERINTENDENT OF MY SCHOOL DID

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:50.264
EVEN KNOW WHAT INDIAN EDUCATION

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:53.167
WAS. NOT ONLY DENYING THE

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.435
EXISTENCE OF OUR PEOPLE OR

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.337
NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:57.805
GENERAL, BUT DENYING ISSUES

01:32:57.872 --> 01:32:59.040
THAT OUR COMMUNITIES FACE IN

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:00.708
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND ACROSS

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.543
CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS INDIAN

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:03.945
COUNTRY, SUCH AS MISSING

01:33:04.011 --> 01:33:05.179
MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:08.282
PEOPLE. ADMIN AT MY SCHOOL

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:09.417
DENIED THAT, DENYING THAT

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:09.984
RESIDENTIAL BOARDING SCHOOLS

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:13.621
DIDN'T EXIST AND THAT I WAS, IN

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:15.356
FACT MAKING UP HISTORY IN MY

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.058
HEAD. I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:19.060
VERY BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THE

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:20.561
ADMIN AT MY SCHOOL WHO WERE

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:21.862
SUPPOSED TO BE EDUCATORS WERE

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:29.470
SIMPLY UNEDUCATED. I'LL JUST

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:30.905
ADD QUICKLY THAT THE WORK THAT

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:33.107
WE DO THROUGH INDIGENOUS

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:25.913
THAT REPRESENT OUR EDUCATION

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.081
INSTITUTIONS WHO ARE STILL

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:29.150
TRYING TO EXERT POWER OVER

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:31.051
NATIVE PEOPLE. AND THE FACT

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:32.720

CELEBRATING, WHICH WE PURPORT

01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:44.365
TO DO, THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:46.834
EXERTING POWER OVER NUMBER OF

01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:50.404
ITEMS YOU SHOULD BE WEARING AT

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:51.805

THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THESE

CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THESE

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:03.784
TYPES OF POLICIES SHOULD HAVE

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:06.921
ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE IN OUR

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:09.790

ISSUE, BECAUSE REALLY,

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:18.299

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:37.051
QUESTIONS. COMMENTS, CERTAINLY

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:39.386
THROUGH YOUR TESTIMONY, HEARING

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:40.821
A SENSE OF BELONGING, A SENSE

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:45.025
OF BELONGING WHEN WE'RE GROWING

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:47.494
UP, BUT ALSO A SENSE OF

01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:49.363
BELONGING NOW STILL IN 2025,

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:51.932
MAKING SURE THAT THAT OUR YOUNG

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:53.801
PEOPLE HAVE A VOICE AND KNOW

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:55.836
THAT THEIR VOICE DOES RESONATE

01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:56.937
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:58.472
CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE

01:37:58.539 --> 01:37:59.840
CHAMBERS, BEING ABLE TO STAND

01:37:59.907 --> 01:38:02.643
UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS HAS

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:04.778
STRENGTHENED MANY IN THIS ROOM

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:06.113
AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:08.349
TO STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHTS

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:09.316
WHEN THEY'RE BEING QUESTIONED,

01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:12.152
AND CERTAINLY CALL TO ACTION,

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:14.355
CALL TO ACTION FROM THE TRIBAL

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:16.190
COMMUNITY TO SEE YOURSELVES IN

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:18.325
THESE SEATS, TO SEE YOURSELVES

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:20.995
AS THE DECISION MAKERS OF

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:23.163
DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:25.032
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:26.967
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS ASKED,

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:29.136
HOW DO YOU SEE THINGS MOVING

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:31.138
FORWARD? WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:33.440
AND IT IS HAVING THE NATIVE

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:35.843
PEOPLE DRIVING THE NARRATIVE

01:38:35.909 --> 01:38:39.013
THAT DRASTICALLY IMPACTS THE

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.848
NATIVE COMMUNITY. I THINK

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:42.650
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:44.752
CONTINUES NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING

01:38:44.818 --> 01:38:46.353
THROUGHOUT THE AREA, BUT IT

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:51.292
ALSO IS MOVING BEYOND TRIBAL

01:38:51.358 --> 01:38:52.693
GOVERNMENTS INTO THE MAINSTREAM

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.995
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

01:38:55.062 --> 01:38:56.130
INTO POSITIONS LIKE THESE

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:56.897
POSITIONS WITHIN THE ATTORNEY

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:58.866
GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT WE SEE

01:38:58.932 --> 01:39:00.968
OURSELVES THERE CERTAINLY

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:02.870
BROUGHT UP THE QUOTA SYSTEM.

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:05.306
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:08.142
CONTINUES TO LIVE WITH A LOT OF

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:08.909
US GROWING UP THROUGH THE

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:10.144
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, BUT KNOW

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:12.246
THAT WE EARNED OUR RIGHT EVERY

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:13.947
STEP OF THE WAY BECAUSE IT

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:15.249
WASN'T JUST THE EDUCATIONAL

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:16.817
SYSTEM CHECKING OFF A BOX, WE

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:18.018
HAD TO STILL SURVIVE IN THAT

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:20.821
ARENA, WORKING 13 TIMES 110

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:23.490
TIMES HARDER THAN THOSE THAT

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:24.825
WERE STUDYING RIGHT NEXT TO US

01:39:24.892 --> 01:39:27.294
TO TO EARN OUR DEGREES IN THE

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:30.130
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AND FOR US,

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:32.132
IT'S NOT JUST AN INDIVIDUAL

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:33.901
MOVING FORWARD. WE CARRY THE

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:36.337
WEIGHT OF OUR PEOPLE TO

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:38.739
CONTINUE TO OPEN THOSE DOORS

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.974
FOR OUR PEOPLE. SO WHEN WE TALK

01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:42.876
ABOUT A QUOTA SYSTEM, THEY USE

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:47.047
IT AGAINST US. BUT WHEN WE

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:50.351
STRIVE, WE DO HAVE TO WORK 110

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:53.520
TIMES HARDER THAN COLLEAGUES

01:39:53.587 --> 01:39:55.689
AND THOSE STUDYING SIDE BY SIDE

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:57.958
WITH US. SO MY HATS OFF TO YOU

01:39:58.025 --> 01:39:59.993
FOR BEING THOSE CHAMPIONS HERE

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:00.894
IN INDIAN COUNTRY. AND TO TALK

01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:03.530
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:40:03.597 --> 01:40:04.164
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM ITSELF. WHEN

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:06.834
YOU LOOK INTO THE POLICIES THAT

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.168
HAVE BEEN INGRAINED IN THE

01:40:08.235 --> 01:40:09.970
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE STATE

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:12.539
OF CALIFORNIA, THEY STILL CARRY

01:40:12.606 --> 01:40:13.674
POLICIES, POLICIES OF

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.843
ASSIMILATION TOWARDS OUR PEOPLE,

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:17.177
WHERE OUR LANGUAGE, OUR CUSTOMS

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:18.779
WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:20.914
ACCEPTED BY THE EDUCATIONAL

01:40:20.981 --> 01:40:23.117
SYSTEM. POLICIES THAT STILL

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:25.919
DRIVE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.855
THAT WERE CREATED BACK IN TIME

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:29.923
STILL HAVE THOSE REMNANTS.

01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:32.426
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRULY UP

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:33.861
AGAINST CHANGING ALL THOSE

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:36.497
POLICIES AROUND TO BE INCLUSIVE

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:39.199
OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE.

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:42.136
AFTER ALL, THEY DO TEACH IN THE

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:44.037
GRADE SYSTEM ABOUT THE HISTORY

01:40:44.104 --> 01:40:46.006
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, BUT

01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:48.041
IT'S TIME THAT OUR VOICES BE

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:50.043
THE ONES DRIVING THAT NARRATIVE.

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:52.446
IT'S TIME TO HAVE HEARINGS LIKE

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:54.181
THIS IN THE PAST PIECES OF

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:56.250
LEGISLATION, AND TO EDUCATE OUR

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:58.452
COLLEAGUES THAT THOSE POLICIES

01:40:58.519 --> 01:41:00.821
OF THE PAST THAT HAVE INSTILLED

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:03.056
SEPARATION, ASSIMILATION IS

01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:04.291
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING TO

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:05.859
BE TOLERATED IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.161
MOVING FORWARD HERE IN THIS DAY

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:08.929

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:10.931

01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:16.170
TOGETHER BY HEARING THESE

01:41:16.236 --> 01:41:18.472
THINGS AND GOING AGAINST THOSE

01:41:18.539 --> 01:41:20.240
POLICIES, POLICIES THAT WERE

01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:23.877
NOT CREATED TO INCLUDE US, BUT

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:25.512
POLICIES THAT WERE CREATED TO

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:27.848
EXCLUDE US. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.950
TRULY TALKING ABOUT. AND AS WE

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:30.818

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.154
PIECE OF LEGISLATION NOW. WE'LL

01:41:34.221 --> 01:41:35.823
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AS

01:41:35.889 --> 01:41:38.292
LONG AS WE'RE IN THE STATE

01:41:38.358 --> 01:41:39.026
LEGISLATURE. BUT AGAIN,

01:41:39.092 --> 01:41:40.794
REALIZING THAT THAT YOUTHFUL

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:42.029
VOICE RISING, THE TRIBAL

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.905
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND

SEE OURSELVES DRIVING THE

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:55.509

GOOD SIGN. THAT'S A BLESSING.

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:26.066
AND I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:27.301
OUR ANCESTORS ARE PRESENT HERE

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:29.036
WITH US TODAY FOR THIS HISTORIC

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:31.004
MOMENT, HOSTING THIS EDUCATION

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:32.773
HEARING HERE ON TRIBAL LANDS.

01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:35.042
AND SO I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU,

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:36.076
ASSEMBLYMAN RAMOS, FOR MAKING

01:43:36.143 --> 01:43:38.879
THIS POSSIBLE. SO I JUST WANT

01:43:38.946 --> 01:43:40.147
TO START BY SAYING THAT THE

01:43:40.213 --> 01:43:41.748
WORDS THAT I SHARE TODAY, I

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:43.417
SHARE IN A GOOD WAY, AND I

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:45.118
SHARE THESE WORDS NOT ONLY AS A

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:46.186
TRIBAL CHAIRWOMAN, BUT AS A

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:47.888
MOTHER AND A GRANDMOTHER. AND

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:49.089
SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THE

01:43:49.156 --> 01:43:49.890
TESTIMONY OF THE PANELISTS

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:53.193
BEFORE US AND, AND TO SOME OF

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:54.928
THE POINTS MADE THAT IT DOES

01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:57.064
KIND OF BLOW THE MIND TO THINK

01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:59.366
THAT WE ARE IN THE YEAR 2025,

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:00.667
AND WE ARE STILL HAVING SOME OF

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:01.234
THESE CONVERSATIONS, FACING

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:04.171
SOME OF THESE SAME ISSUES. AND

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:06.006
SO WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT

01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:07.708
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TODAY, I

01:44:07.774 --> 01:44:08.909
GOT TO THINKING ABOUT MY

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:10.877
GRANDSON. HE RECENTLY GRADUATED

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:12.212
FROM PRESCHOOL AND THINKING

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:12.980
ABOUT HE'S BEGINNING HIS

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:14.881
EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY. AND FOR

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:15.849
THE YOUNG ONES LIKE HIM, WHAT

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:18.452
THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR HIM. AND

01:44:18.518 --> 01:44:20.053
I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN GET TO

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.722
MAKING SOME CHANGES WITH WITH

01:44:21.788 --> 01:44:22.990
POLICY, WHERE HIS EDUCATIONAL

01:44:23.056 --> 01:44:24.992
JOURNEY IS GOING TO LOOK VERY

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:25.726
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MY

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:26.927
EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY WAS LIKE,

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:28.195
FROM WHAT YOUR EDUCATIONAL

01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:30.130
JOURNEY WAS LIKE. AND SO I

01:44:30.197 --> 01:44:31.932
THINK A PART OF THAT IS GETTING

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:34.267
BACK TO CONNECTING WITH WHY WE

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:37.270
TEACH IN THE ERA OF RAPID

01:44:37.337 --> 01:44:38.271
TECHNOLOGY AND CONSTANT CHANGE,

01:44:38.338 --> 01:44:40.807
IT IS EASY TO LOSE SIGHT OF WHY

01:44:40.874 --> 01:44:42.109
WE TEACH. AT ITS HEART,

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:43.744
EDUCATION IS NOT ABOUT RAISING

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.879
TEST SCORES OR FILLING IN

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:46.947
WORKSHEETS. IT IS ABOUT

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:47.447
MOTIVATING OUR CHILDREN,

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:48.982
HELPING THEM BY GUIDING THEIR

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.884
NATURAL CURIOSITY TO LEARN,

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:53.286
CREATE AND INVENT. IN NATIVE

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.821
TRADITIONS, WE TEACH THROUGH

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:57.624
SONG, STORY, AND CEREMONY. WE

01:44:57.691 --> 01:44:58.825
TEACH BALANCE WITHIN ONESELF

01:44:58.892 --> 01:45:00.160
WITH THE NATURAL WORLD AND WITH

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.628
SOCIETY. THESE TEACHINGS,

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:02.996
COMBINED WITH THE GUIDANCE OF

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:05.065
TEACHERS AND MENTORS, NURTURE

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:06.199
RESILIENT AND EMOTIONALLY

01:45:06.266 --> 01:45:07.768
MATURE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAN

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:10.070
NAVIGATE CHALLENGES, RISE AFTER

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:11.204
FAILURE, AND GROW INTO CARING

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:12.906
MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:14.207
WHEN WE BRAID THESE TRADITIONS

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.209
TOGETHER WITH MODERN TOOLS LIKE

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:17.911
TECHNOLOGY, EVERY RESOURCE

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.212
WHETHER IT'S A BOOK, A LAPTOP

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:20.847
OR AN ELDER STORY BECOMES A

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:22.049
PATHWAY TO RAISING THE NEXT

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:24.685
GENERATION GROUNDED IN RESPECT,

01:45:24.751 --> 01:45:25.852
EMPATHY, AND RESPONSIBILITY. I

01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:28.188
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE A WORLD

01:45:28.255 --> 01:45:30.891
WHERE WE REIMAGINE HOW WE TEACH,

01:45:30.957 --> 01:45:32.092
BECAUSE THE CURRENT PUBLIC

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.727
SCHOOL MODEL WAS DESIGNED FOR A

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:34.961
DIFFERENT ERA, WITH LONG BLOCKS

01:45:35.028 --> 01:45:37.030
OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:37.698
INSTRUCTION THAT NO LONGER

01:45:37.764 --> 01:45:38.899
MATCHED THE NEEDS OF TODAY'S

01:45:38.965 --> 01:45:40.467
STUDENTS OR TOMORROW'S

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:42.069
WORKFORCE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:42.869
US IMAGINE A SYSTEM THAT IS

01:45:42.936 --> 01:45:44.905
PERSONALIZED, NOT STANDARDIZED,

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:47.040
EXPERIENTIAL, NOT MEMORIZED,

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.509
INNOVATIVE, BUT STILL HUMAN AT

01:45:49.576 --> 01:45:51.211
ITS CORE, ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:51.945
PILOT PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:54.314
PROVING WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:55.182
CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD BY SCALING

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:57.584
THESE INNOVATIONS STATEWIDE.

01:45:57.651 --> 01:45:58.952
LEARNING BY DOING THROUGH

01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:00.754
EXPERIENTIAL PROJECTS,

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:02.189
COLLABORATION ACROSS

01:46:02.255 --> 01:46:03.390
DISCIPLINES SO STUDENTS PROBLEM

01:46:03.457 --> 01:46:04.891
SOLVE TOGETHER MORE PURPOSEFUL

01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:06.893
SCHOOL DAYS. PRIORITIZING

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.029
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY.

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:10.430
PERSONALIZED INSTRUCTION

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:10.964
SUPPORTED BY TECHNOLOGY.

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:14.034
MEETING DIVERSE LEARNING STYLES

01:46:14.101 --> 01:46:16.203
AND PERSONALIZED INSTRUCTION.

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.971
EXCUSE ME RESTORATIVE

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.239
DISCIPLINE POLICIES FOCUSING ON

01:46:19.306 --> 01:46:21.041
SUPPORT, NOT PUNISHMENT,

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:22.175
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR

01:46:22.242 --> 01:46:25.212
NATIVE YOUTH. AND WE HEARD

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:27.380
EARLIER, YOU KNOW, ABOUT HOW

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:28.782
REPRESENTATION MATTERS. AND AS

01:46:28.849 --> 01:46:29.850
TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:32.085
CALIFORNIA, WE KNOW OUR NATIVE

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:32.819
STUDENTS THRIVE WHEN THEY SEE

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:34.454
THEIR IDENTITIES, HISTORIES AND

01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:35.655
CONTRIBUTIONS REFLECTED IN

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:37.791
CLASSROOMS AND CURRICULUM. TO

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.126
ACHIEVE THIS, SCHOOLS MUST

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:40.827
TEACH ACCURATE LOCAL TRIBAL

01:46:40.894 --> 01:46:43.597
HISTORY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:46:43.663 --> 01:46:44.064
LOCAL TRIBES. INCLUDE

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:46.032

CONTRIBUTIONS IN SCIENCE, THE

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:48.168
ARTS, GOVERNANCE AND

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:50.003
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP.

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.805
ACTIVELY RECRUIT NATIVE

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.039
TEACHERS, COUNSELORS AND

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:54.708
ADMINISTRATORS. ESTABLISH

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:56.877
MENTORSHIP PIPELINES FOR NATIVE

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:58.612

AND VISIBLE SPACES AND STOCK

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:10.891
LIBRARIES WITH WORKS BY NATIVE

01:47:10.957 --> 01:47:12.692
AUTHORS AND SCHOLARS. FOR

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:13.927
REPRESENTATION IS NOT SIMPLY

01:47:13.994 --> 01:47:16.163
INCLUSION, IT IS RESTORATION.

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.963
IT RESTORES TRUTH, BELONGING

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:19.332
AND VISIBILITY FOR NATIVE YOUTH

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:21.001
WHILE DEEPENING ALL STUDENTS

01:47:21.067 --> 01:47:21.868
UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGINAL

01:47:21.935 --> 01:47:25.005
PEOPLES OF THEIR REGION. I

01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:25.806
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HAVE AN

01:47:25.872 --> 01:47:27.874
EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT BALANCES

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:29.442
TECHNOLOGY WITH THE NATURAL

01:47:29.509 --> 01:47:30.877
WORLD. AS NATIVE PEOPLE, WE ARE

01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:32.846
TAUGHT TO LIVE IN BALANCE WITH

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:33.947
THE EARTH, WITH EACH OTHER AND

01:47:34.014 --> 01:47:35.916
WITH ALL LIVING THINGS. TODAY'S

01:47:35.982 --> 01:47:37.951
CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP IN A

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:38.752
WORLD DOMINATED BY SCREENS AND

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:39.853
ALGORITHMS, AND OUR

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.855
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO KEEP THEM

01:47:41.922 --> 01:47:43.757
GROUNDED. THIS MEANS REQUIRING

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:44.858

01:47:51.298 --> 01:47:51.698
TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:53.834
KNOWLEDGE. IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.468
AS TEACHING LESSONS IN GARDENS,

01:47:55.535 --> 01:47:57.070

BIOLOGY, FOOD SOVEREIGNTY AND

THROUGH TOUCH, OBSERVATION AND

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:10.283
EXPERIENCE. IN THE ERA OF AI,

01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:11.751
STAYING ROOTED IN THE NATURAL

01:48:11.818 --> 01:48:12.853
WORLD IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

01:48:12.919 --> 01:48:15.222
EVER. IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.990

01:48:17.057 --> 01:48:18.925
GOVERNMENTS, WE HAVE A SEAT AT

THE TABLE AND WE WANT TO HELP

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.828
BUILD A BETTER TABLE THAT

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:23.330
REFLECTS OUR SHARED HISTORY AND

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:24.231
OUR SHARED FUTURE, ONE WHERE

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:25.799
NATIVE YOUTH ARE NOT MERELY

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:27.000
SURVIVING THE EDUCATION SYSTEM,

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:28.635

TODAY IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL,

01:49:02.235 --> 01:49:04.137

THIS ROOM, OUR FIRST TEACHERS

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:07.107
WERE OUR PARENTS. AND WHOEVER

01:49:07.173 --> 01:49:08.975
WAS IN THE HOME AND AS AS

01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:09.843
NATIVE PEOPLE, WE WERE TAUGHT A

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:14.180
CERTAIN WAY. AND FAST FORWARD

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:15.849
TO GETTING, GOING, GOING TO

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:18.351
SCHOOL. THE STEREOTYPE THAT IS

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:20.854
GIVEN ON NATIVE PEOPLE IS IS

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:23.089
OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS TRIBAL

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:23.790
LEADERS TO EDUCATE THE

01:49:23.857 --> 01:49:27.027
EDUCATORS. YOU KNOW, IT'S AND I

01:49:27.093 --> 01:49:28.762
MEAN THIS IN THE MOST

01:49:28.828 --> 01:49:29.930
RESPECTFUL WAY. YOU KNOW, I

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.131
KNOW THAT THERE'S A JOB THAT

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:33.233
HAS TO BE DONE, BUT THERE IS

01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.435
NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR FOR

01:49:35.502 --> 01:49:36.569
NATIVE STUDENTS AND NON-NATIVE

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:39.973
STUDENTS. SO IT'S WE WOULD LIKE

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:40.740

01:49:40.807 --> 01:49:44.244
SOLUTIONS HERE. EDUCATE THE

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:46.079
EDUCATORS. YOU KNOW, ENCOURAGE

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:49.549
EDUCATORS TO REFLECT ON THEIR

01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:52.953
OWN BIASES AND CHALLENGE WHAT

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.721
THE STEREOTYPES ARE, WHAT THEY

01:49:54.788 --> 01:49:57.557
BELIEVE. FOR US TO BE NATIVE

01:49:57.624 --> 01:50:02.295
AMERICANS AND ASK QUESTIONS AND

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:04.731
LISTENING TO BELLA GARCIA SPEAK,

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:07.067
YOU KNOW, YOUR YOUR HEART

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:08.234
SWELLS WITH PRIDE WHEN YOU SEE

01:50:08.301 --> 01:50:10.904
A YOUNG PERSON COME UP HERE AND

01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:14.140
SPEAK TO A PANEL TO CHALLENGE A

01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:18.111
SCHOOL DISTRICT. NOW. AND I

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:19.913
LISTENED IN LISTENING TO HER

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:23.883
TESTIMONY. IS THERE THE

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:25.085
PAPERWORK THAT SHE HAS TO FILL

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:28.221
OUT FOR FEATHERS, FOR CAP TO,

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:29.155
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:31.858
MATTERS TO HER? I WOULD MY

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:33.426
QUESTION TO THE SCHOOL

01:50:33.493 --> 01:50:35.028
DISTRICTS. CLOVIS UNIFIED IN

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:38.164
PARTICULAR IS THEIR PAPERWORK,

01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:41.434
WHERE EVERY STUDENT HAS TO FILL

01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:44.804
OUT IF THEY FOR A SPECIFIC

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:46.072
DENOMINATION OF JEWELRY THEY

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:48.708
WEAR. THAT WOULD BE THE

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:50.877
QUESTION I WOULD HAVE TO THEM,

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:53.113
YOU KNOW, IS, IS THERE IS THERE

01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:54.280
DOCUMENTATION OR IS THERE ANY,

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:55.148
ANY SORT OF DOCUMENTATION THAT

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:57.784
IS NEEDED FOR ALL STUDENTS THAT

01:50:57.851 --> 01:51:00.487
WANT TO WEAR SOMETHING THAT

01:51:00.553 --> 01:51:02.889
THEY VALUE IMMENSELY? YOU KNOW,

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:05.592
THE THE JEWELRY THAT REPRESENTS

01:51:05.658 --> 01:51:07.093
SPECIFIC DENOMINATIONS, LIKE I

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:10.030
SAID, BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF

01:51:10.096 --> 01:51:11.765
COURAGE FOR SOMEONE LIKE THAT

01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:13.967
AND FOR HER TO SPEAK UP. SHE'S

01:51:14.034 --> 01:51:15.235
SOMEONE. SOMEONE IS LISTENING.

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:17.937
SOMEONE IS ALWAYS WATCHING. AND

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:19.506
I BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE THAT

01:51:19.572 --> 01:51:22.308
SEES HER STAND UP TO TO THE

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:24.044
SCHOOL DISTRICT. I THINK THAT'S

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:24.844
A BIG INSPIRATION FOR OTHER

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:27.947
STUDENTS TO KNOW THAT IT'S OKAY.

01:51:28.014 --> 01:51:29.816
BUT AS, AS, AS TRIBAL LEADERS,

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:32.986
WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.

01:51:33.053 --> 01:51:34.888
THE SOLUTION FOR US WOULD BE TO

01:51:34.954 --> 01:51:37.690
CREATE A SPACE FOR A POSITIVE

01:51:37.757 --> 01:51:39.259
IDENTITY WHERE THE KIDS THAT

01:51:39.325 --> 01:51:41.161
CAN RELATE NOT JUST NATIVE KIDS,

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:43.797
BUT ALL KIDS, BECAUSE ONLY

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:46.132
THING THAT WE ASK IS EQUALITY.

01:51:46.199 --> 01:51:49.235
AND EQUALITY IS REALLY BIG WHEN

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:50.036
WHEN YOUNG STUDENTS WANT TO

01:51:50.103 --> 01:51:52.172
FIND THAT CIRCLE, YOU DON'T

01:51:52.238 --> 01:51:54.040
WANT THAT CIRCLE BROKEN BY

01:51:54.107 --> 01:51:56.943
RACISM BECAUSE CLOVIS UNIFIED,

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:59.612
THAT IS EXACTLY. THAT'S EXACTLY

01:51:59.679 --> 01:52:00.747
WHAT IT IS. AND THE OTHER

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:02.315
SOLUTION FOR US WOULD BE

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:03.183
PROMOTE PARTNERSHIPS WITH

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:05.752
TRIBES. YOU KNOW, THERE'S MANY,

01:52:05.819 --> 01:52:07.454
MANY TRIBES IN THESE DISTRICTS

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:09.556
AND THESE AND OUR STUDENTS THAT

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:11.391
ARE THERE THAT PARTICIPATE IN

01:52:11.458 --> 01:52:13.159
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. THE ONLY

01:52:13.226 --> 01:52:14.961
TIME THAT WE GET A PHONE CALL

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:17.464
IS WHEN SOME ONE OF OUR NATIVE

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:18.932
KIDS IS DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

01:52:18.998 --> 01:52:21.634
WELL, GIVE US A CALL WHEN

01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:22.669
THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:25.939
BUT IN THE ON A PERSONAL VIEW,

01:52:26.005 --> 01:52:27.740
MY PERSONAL VIEWPOINT IS LIKE

01:52:27.807 --> 01:52:30.076
WHEN AS TRIBAL LEADERS, YOU

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:32.812
KNOW, WE WE'RE WE'RE IN THE

01:52:32.879 --> 01:52:34.914
WE'RE IN A SPACE WHERE WE HAVE

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:36.616
TRIBES CARRY A LOT OF WEIGHT,

01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:38.418
WE HAVE THE REPRESENTATION OF

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:40.120
OUR PEOPLE, BUT WE HAVE A LOCAL

01:52:40.186 --> 01:52:44.224
SCHOOL, CENTRAL UNIFIED SCHOOL,

01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:45.725
NOT TOO FAR FROM OUR RANCHERIA.

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:47.894
VICE CHAIRMAN ROBERT, JEFF AND

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.162
I, WE WENT TO THE SCHOOL

01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:50.864
BECAUSE WE HAD SOME WE HAD SOME,

01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:52.098
SOME ISSUES GOING ON THE

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:53.133
RANCHERIA THAT MAY HAVE

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:54.868
AFFECTED THE KIDS IN A NEGATIVE

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:57.103
WAY. SO WE WENT AND HAD LUNCH

01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.972
WITH THE KIDS, AND YOU SHOULD

01:52:59.038 --> 01:53:00.974
HAVE SEEN NHÀ. YOU SHOULD HAVE

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.675
SEEN THE EYES LIGHT UP IN THESE

01:53:02.742 --> 01:53:04.310
NATIVE KIDS, THE KIDS THAT YOU

01:53:04.377 --> 01:53:07.013
KNOW, THAT OUR OUR CHAIRMAN AND

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:07.780
OUR VICE CHAIRMAN ARE HERE

01:53:07.847 --> 01:53:08.882
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WE

01:53:08.948 --> 01:53:11.151
MATTER. AND I THINK THAT'S THE

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:12.252
IMPORTANT POINT, THAT WHEN WE

01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:14.053
WHEN WE TALK TO WHEN WE TALK TO

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.955
OUR YOUTH, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:16.823
IT'S, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T DO

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:19.259
WHAT I DO, DO WHAT I SAY.

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:20.026
THAT'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT I

01:53:20.093 --> 01:53:21.861
GREW UP IN. BUT AT SOME POINT,

01:53:21.928 --> 01:53:23.029
YOU KNOW, WHEN IS THAT ENOUGH?

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:24.964
YOU KNOW, TIMES CHANGE. YOU

01:53:25.031 --> 01:53:25.798
KNOW, WE'RE CONDITIONED TO BE A

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:27.033
CERTAIN WAY. BUT, YOU KNOW,

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:29.302
WHEN US AS PARENTS AND

01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:30.170
GRANDPARENTS, WE WANT TO TEACH

01:53:30.236 --> 01:53:31.804
OUR KIDS SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

01:53:31.871 --> 01:53:33.306
NOT STRAYING AWAY FROM THE

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:34.707
CULTURE, BUT THE CULTURE IS

01:53:34.774 --> 01:53:36.776
ACTUALLY WHAT WHAT BUILDS OUR

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:38.111
FOUNDATION. NOT TO STRAY AWAY

01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:39.712
FROM THAT, BUT JUST TO ADD ON

01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:41.848
TO TO WHAT OUR ANCESTORS DID

01:53:41.915 --> 01:53:43.116
FOR US, WHERE OUR PARENTS,

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:43.683
GRANDPARENTS, GREAT

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:45.818
GRANDPARENTS DID FOR US AND TO

01:53:45.885 --> 01:53:47.420
TO CONTINUE TO ADD ON TO IT,

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:48.688
BECAUSE EDUCATION IS A VERY

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:50.023
POSITIVE TOOL. BUT IN THIS

01:53:50.089 --> 01:53:52.125
ASPECT, IN MANY WAYS, IT WASN'T

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:53.960
IT WASN'T BEING USED. IT WAS,

01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:56.029
YOU KNOW, BELLA HAD TO EDUCATE

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:57.297
HERSELF HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE

01:53:57.363 --> 01:53:58.765
THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR

01:53:58.831 --> 01:54:00.033
CULTURE. AND I THINK THAT MADE

01:54:00.099 --> 01:54:01.668
HER A MUCH BETTER PERSON TO

01:54:01.734 --> 01:54:03.469
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WORLD CAN

01:54:03.536 --> 01:54:04.971
BE VERY, VERY CRUEL. BUT AT THE

01:54:05.038 --> 01:54:06.306
SAME TIME, IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T

01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:08.274
ALLOW HER. SHE DIDN'T ALLOW

01:54:08.341 --> 01:54:11.844
HERSELF TO, YOU KNOW, TO FAIL,

01:54:11.911 --> 01:54:13.947
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE MANY OF US,

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:15.515
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO FAIL

01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:17.317
IN LIFE. AND, YOU KNOW, SHE GOT

01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:18.985
KNOCKED DOWN AND SHE PICKED

01:54:19.052 --> 01:54:19.886
HERSELF UP WITH THE SUPPORT OF

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:22.255
HER COMMUNITY, WITH US, YOU

01:54:22.322 --> 01:54:24.123
KNOW, CHAIRMAN NITO, VICE

01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:25.858
CHAIRMAN JEFF SPOKE UP FOR HER.

01:54:25.925 --> 01:54:27.927
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, SHE

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:29.596
DOES THE HARD WORK, YOU KNOW,

01:54:29.662 --> 01:54:30.830
AND AGAIN, THE KIDS THAT ARE

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:31.998
REPRESENTED, YOU KNOW, WANT TO

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:33.533
LET THEM KNOW, WHOEVER'S

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:34.167
LISTENING, WHOEVER'S WATCHING,

01:54:34.234 --> 01:54:36.302
WE HAVE ALL OF YOU, YOU KNOW,

02:01:07.126 --> 02:01:09.061
TO JUST SEND IT IN THE MAIL. WE

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:10.863
WANTED IT TO BE DELIVERED WITH

02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:12.031
CONVICTION SO THAT THEY

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:13.933
UNDERSTOOD, YOU KNOW, WE COULD

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:14.934
LOOK THEM IN THE FACE AND LET

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:17.036
THEM SEE HOW WE FEEL ABOUT IT.

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:18.871
AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO DELIVER

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:20.840
IT DIRECTLY TO HER AND TO THE

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.975
ENTIRE BOARD AND, YOU KNOW, TO

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:24.777
THE PUBLIC. AND SO FROM THAT,

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:26.445
AFTER THE MEETING WITH THE

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:28.114
ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT, HIM

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.282
AND I HAD A DISCUSSION OUT ON

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:32.485
THE FRONT STEPS FOR A COUPLE OF

02:01:32.551 --> 02:01:33.886
HOURS ABOUT WHAT THE PLAN WAS

02:01:33.953 --> 02:01:35.988
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. AND

02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:37.690
HE DESCRIBED TO ME THIS CONCEPT

02:01:37.757 --> 02:01:39.892
OF THIS DOCUMENT THAT WAS

02:01:39.959 --> 02:01:41.727
DISCUSSED TODAY ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:42.928
THE FORM THAT THEY WERE GOING

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:45.031
TO HAVE TO FILL OUT AND THE

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:46.699
CONCEPT, YOU KNOW, I WAS OKAY

02:01:46.766 --> 02:01:47.933
WITH THE CONCEPT BECAUSE THE

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.969
CONCEPT BROUGHT A PROCESS TO

02:01:50.036 --> 02:01:52.138
THE TABLE THAT COULD BE

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:55.074
RECOGNIZED, IDENTIFIED, AND

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:57.043
MAKE SURE THAT THINGS WERE

02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:59.145
BEING DONE PROPERLY. AND THEN

02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:01.380
THE IDEA WAS NOT JUST FOR

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:01.814
NATIVES, BUT FOR ALL

02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:03.049
NATIONALITIES, ALL RACES,

02:02:03.115 --> 02:02:04.684
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT A

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:07.219
SCHOOL FACULTY CAN KNOW

02:02:07.286 --> 02:02:08.287
EVERYBODY'S CULTURE. THEY'RE

02:02:08.354 --> 02:02:09.855
NOT GOING TO KNOW THE

02:02:09.922 --> 02:02:11.657
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT

02:02:11.724 --> 02:02:12.458
TRIBES AND DIFFERENT

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:13.693
NATIONALITIES. SO I THOUGHT THE

02:02:13.759 --> 02:02:14.960
CONCEPT WAS GOOD, BUT I FELT

02:02:15.027 --> 02:02:16.996
LIKE IT NEEDED SOME SHORING UP.

02:02:17.063 --> 02:02:17.930
AND THEN ALSO, THERE'S A

02:02:17.997 --> 02:02:19.799
HISTORY HERE, YOU KNOW, ARE

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:21.434
THEY REALLY GOING TO FOLLOW

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:24.203
THROUGH? YOU KNOW, AND SO HE

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:25.071
ASSURED ME THAT THEY WERE GOING

02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:28.240
TO PUT THIS TOGETHER, PLAN SOME

02:02:28.307 --> 02:02:29.108
TRAININGS TO THEIR PEOPLE,

02:02:29.175 --> 02:02:32.411
THEIR, THEIR FACULTY. AND SO,

02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:35.081
YOU KNOW, I CHECKED UP ON IT TO

02:02:35.147 --> 02:02:36.849
SEE HOW IT WAS GOING. AND THEN

02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:38.317
JAY PETERSON FROM THE

02:02:38.384 --> 02:02:39.485
CALIFORNIA INDIAN LEGAL

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:41.887
SERVICES CALLED ME ONE DAY TO

02:02:41.954 --> 02:02:43.656
TO SEE HOW THINGS WERE GOING.

02:02:43.723 --> 02:02:45.758
AND THEN HE WAS PUTTING A

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:47.960
MEETING TOGETHER WITH THE

02:02:48.027 --> 02:02:49.795
DISTRICT'S LEGAL TEAM TO TALK

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:52.098
ABOUT IT. SO I LET HIM KNOW

02:02:52.164 --> 02:02:54.166
WHAT WAS WHAT WAS IN PLAY AND

02:02:54.233 --> 02:02:55.468
WHAT WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE

02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:57.703
GOING TO DO. AND SO THEN HE HE

02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:58.938
CANCELED THE MEETING TO SEE HOW

02:02:59.004 --> 02:03:00.773
IT WOULD PLAY OUT, BECAUSE BOTH

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.775
OF US WERE A LITTLE BIT LEERY

02:03:02.842 --> 02:03:04.977
THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY THEY'VE

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:06.245
HAD A HISTORY OF NOT FOLLOWING

02:03:06.312 --> 02:03:07.880
THROUGH AND, YOU KNOW, NOT

02:03:07.947 --> 02:03:10.816
HELPING OUR KIDS. SO IN THE END,

02:03:10.883 --> 02:03:13.786
YOU KNOW, HE SAID THAT MARK

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:15.121
HAMMOND WAS HIS NAME. HE SAID

02:03:15.187 --> 02:03:16.989
THAT AT THE END OF MARCH, HE

02:03:17.056 --> 02:03:19.458
WAS HOPING TO HAVE IT COMPLETED

02:03:19.525 --> 02:03:20.259
BY THE END OF MARCH AND

02:03:20.326 --> 02:03:21.060
ACTUALLY PROVIDE TRAINING TO

02:03:21.127 --> 02:03:22.995
ALL THEIR FACULTY ON HOW THE

02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:24.697
PROCESS WAS GOING TO WORK. NOW,

02:03:24.764 --> 02:03:26.932
THEY CAME OUT WITH THE FORM AND

02:03:26.999 --> 02:03:28.667
AND THEY THEY DID FOLLOW

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:29.902
THROUGH THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL.

02:03:29.969 --> 02:03:32.037
THEY GOT IT OUT. YOU KNOW,

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:33.239
BELLA HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:34.974
FILL IT OUT AND AND YEAH, AS IT

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.376
WAS STATED, IT DID SAY TWO

02:03:37.443 --> 02:03:38.778
PIECES OF ENDORSEMENT. BUT, YOU

02:03:38.844 --> 02:03:40.880
KNOW, I TALKED TO MARK AND SAID,

02:03:40.946 --> 02:03:42.181
YOU KNOW, WE JUST CAN'T HAVE

02:03:42.248 --> 02:03:43.849
THAT. I MEAN, IT'S NOT FOR THE

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:46.352
SCHOOL TO DECIDE, YOU KNOW,

02:03:46.418 --> 02:03:47.386
COLORS, REGALIA, ADORNMENT,

02:03:47.453 --> 02:03:49.889
THAT KIND OF THING. AND SO I

02:03:49.955 --> 02:03:52.758
THINK MORE PIECES WERE ALLOWED.

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:55.161
AND I HAD SOME BRIEF DISCUSSION

02:03:55.227 --> 02:03:57.329
WITH, WITH MR. RAMOS ABOUT, YOU

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:59.131
KNOW, ADDING TO THAT, ADDING

02:03:59.198 --> 02:04:00.733
MORE VERBIAGE, ADDING MORE

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:01.867
LANGUAGE AND MAYBE, MAYBE

02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:04.036
HAVING THAT CONCEPT THAT FORM

02:04:04.103 --> 02:04:05.905
IN PLACE, BUT MAYBE ALSO HAVING

02:04:05.971 --> 02:04:08.340
SOMEWHERE IN THERE THAT, THAT

02:04:08.407 --> 02:04:10.709
THE, THE TRIBE OF THE STUDENT,

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:13.045
YOU KNOW, CONFIRMS AND SIGNS

02:04:13.112 --> 02:04:15.848
OFF THAT THAT IS PROPER REGALIA,

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:18.050
THAT THAT IS PROPER CULTURE FOR

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:20.419
THAT TRIBE AND THAT STUDENT.

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:22.688
BUT BOTTOM LINE, NOT ALLOW THE

02:04:22.755 --> 02:04:24.857
SCHOOL SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE

02:04:24.924 --> 02:04:26.692
SCHOOL SYSTEM TO SAY, YOU KNOW,

02:04:26.759 --> 02:04:28.828
IT'S REALLY ON US. AND AND I

02:04:28.894 --> 02:04:30.930
JUST WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT

02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:31.797
WHOLE PROCESS OF WHAT WE WENT

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:32.998
THROUGH BECAUSE OUR TRIBAL

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:35.367
COUNCIL FELT THAT IT WAS IT WAS

02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:36.902
A SERIOUS MATTER IN THE PAST,

02:04:36.969 --> 02:04:38.838
SOME THINGS KIND OF GET SKIPPED

02:04:38.904 --> 02:04:40.039
OVER BECAUSE THE STUDENT, THE

02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:41.874
STUDENT MAY NOT, YOU KNOW, HAVE

02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:43.909
THE COURAGE LIKE BELLA DID TO

02:04:43.976 --> 02:04:46.011
STAND UP. AND SO IT GETS

02:04:46.078 --> 02:04:46.946
SMOOTHED OVER AND WE DON'T HEAR

02:04:47.012 --> 02:04:49.315
ABOUT IT. BUT SHE CHOSE TO

02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:51.851
STAND UP, AND WE FELT THAT IT

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:53.586
WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:55.120
ACTION IMMEDIATELY, HELP HER

02:04:55.187 --> 02:04:56.989
STAND BEHIND HER. AND WE WE

02:04:57.056 --> 02:04:58.824
ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO

02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:01.026
CHAIRMAN NIETO, YOU KNOW, AND

02:05:01.093 --> 02:05:02.995
AND ALL THE COMMUNITY THAT

02:05:03.062 --> 02:05:04.630
SUPPORTED HER. MR. RAMOS MADE

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:07.132
IT. THIS IS THIS IS A BIG THING.

02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:10.169
IT'S A VERY BIG THING. BUT WE

02:05:10.236 --> 02:05:11.403
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:13.739
AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET IN

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:14.940
LITIGATION, TO HAVE HAVE THAT

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:17.142
SHORT UP A LITTLE BIT BETTER. I

02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:18.844
AGAIN, LIKE I MENTIONED, I

02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:21.280
THINK THE CONCEPT IS GOOD,

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:22.248
SHOWS SOME CHECKS AND BALANCE,

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:25.150
BUT IT CAN'T BE THE SCHOOL'S,

02:05:25.217 --> 02:05:27.753
IT CAN'T BE THE SCHOOL'S SAY ON

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:30.656
HOW OUR CULTURE IS AND WHAT WE

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:36.061
DO AS INDIAN PEOPLE. THANK YOU.

02:05:36.128 --> 02:05:38.898
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:40.933

CHAIRS. AND CERTAINLY NOW WE

WHEN WE'RE ALREADY HERE? I MEAN,

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:36.922

I MEAN, IT'S NEVER HASN'T

THROUGH WITH ALL OUR COUNCIL

02:06:59.578 --> 02:07:00.946
STUFF, AND I WAS SCROLLING

02:07:01.013 --> 02:07:02.047
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE YOU

02:07:02.114 --> 02:07:03.983
USUALLY DO, JUST FLICKING

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:05.818
EVERYTHING UP. AND THEN I DON'T

02:07:05.884 --> 02:07:07.920
KNOW WHY IT STOPPED ON HER

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:08.854
THING, BUT IT'S SOMEONE WAS

02:07:08.921 --> 02:07:10.889
SHARING HER STORY. SO I REACHED

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:12.958
OUT TO HER AFTER I READ A

LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT. KIND OF

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:16.962
MADE ME ANGRY. SO, YOU KNOW, I

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:18.931
DIDN'T TURN GREEN. I LIKE TO BE

TOLD HER THE ALLIES THAT I HAVE,

02:07:30.609 --> 02:07:32.244

HUTCHINS. BUT, YOU KNOW,

SOMETIMES LIZ HUTCHINS IS A LOT

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:54.700
OF SMOKE SIGNALS FOR TECHNOLOGY

02:07:54.767 --> 02:07:56.869

02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:07.913
LET HER KNOW, BUT I WANTED TO

02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.948
REACH OUT TO LIZ. BUT LIZ. LIZ

02:08:10.015 --> 02:08:11.984
DIDN'T ANSWER, SO I HAD TO

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:13.285
REACH OUT TO BOBBY. YOU KNOW,

02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:14.953
HE'S NOT A STRONG WOMAN, BUT

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:17.156
HE'S A COOL BRO, SO. AND HE'S A

02:08:17.222 --> 02:08:18.891
LEADER. SO I REACHED OUT TO HIM

02:08:18.957 --> 02:08:21.060
AND HE GOT ON THE CALL. YOU

02:08:21.126 --> 02:08:24.029
KNOW, I WAS DOWN IN 29 PALMS AT

02:08:24.096 --> 02:08:25.931
THIS TIME, DRIVING BACK AT 2:00

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:27.733
IN THE MORNING. AND THEN JAY

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.001
FROM SEALS. I DON'T KNOW WHY

02:08:29.068 --> 02:08:30.969
THAT WHITE GUY'S AWAKE AT THAT

02:08:31.036 --> 02:08:32.805
TIME, BUT HE CALLED ME UP AND

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:34.940
ASKED ME IF HE COULD BE ON THE

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:36.775
ZOOM ALSO. SO THAT'S HOW IT ALL

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:39.011
STARTED WITH US. AND, YOU KNOW,

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:40.245
IF I DIDN'T SEE HER STANDING UP

02:08:40.312 --> 02:08:41.814
FOR HERSELF, YOU KNOW, I

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.049
PROBABLY WOULD NEVER, NEVER HIT

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:47.086
HER UP. YOU KNOW, THINGS HAPPEN

02:08:47.152 --> 02:08:49.154
FOR A REASON, YOU KNOW? BUT

02:08:49.221 --> 02:08:50.789
WITH THAT BEING SAID, YOU KNOW,

02:08:50.856 --> 02:08:52.257
THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED,

02:08:52.324 --> 02:08:53.792
YOU KNOW, AND AND THEN KELLY

02:08:53.859 --> 02:08:55.994
BRINGING ME TO MEET THE

02:08:56.061 --> 02:08:58.764
PRESIDENT OF FRESNO STATE, YOU

02:08:58.831 --> 02:09:00.999
KNOW, ME AND HER TALKED ABOUT

02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:02.134
IT. SHE'S ANOTHER STRONG WOMAN

02:09:02.201 --> 02:09:03.869
THAT I LIKE TO BE AROUND. YOU

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:05.070
KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF STRONG

02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:07.072
WOMEN LIKE JACKIE. AND YOU KNOW,

02:09:07.139 --> 02:09:08.807
WE COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE

02:09:08.874 --> 02:09:10.109
WOMEN THAT ARE STRONG THAT I

02:09:10.175 --> 02:09:12.211
KNOW, YOU KNOW, BUT THEY'RE

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:17.883
GOOD PEOPLE. AND ANYWAYS. I

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:19.051
TALKED TO TONY A COUPLE TIMES

02:09:19.118 --> 02:09:20.853
ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF ON THE

02:09:20.919 --> 02:09:21.954
SIDE, YOU KNOW, AND I WAS

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:25.023
ASKING HIM, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE

02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:27.192
SOLUTIONS THAT I HAD IN MY HEAD,

02:09:27.259 --> 02:09:28.894
YOU KNOW, LIKE, YOU KNOW, OUR

02:09:28.961 --> 02:09:30.863
KIDS DON'T LIKE OUR US TO TAKE

02:09:30.929 --> 02:09:32.965
THEIR PHONES, THEIR, THEIR

02:09:33.031 --> 02:09:34.733
POWER WIRES TO THEIR

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:36.135
PLAYSTATIONS WHEN THEY GET IN

02:09:36.201 --> 02:09:38.003
TROUBLE. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I

02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:38.971
DON'T SPANK MY KIDS, YOU KNOW,

02:09:39.037 --> 02:09:41.340
I MEAN, I NEVER SPANK MY KIDS,

02:09:41.406 --> 02:09:43.041
SO, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, BUT I

02:09:43.108 --> 02:09:43.976
TAKE THINGS FROM THEM THAT THEY

02:09:44.042 --> 02:09:46.078
I KNOW THEY LIKE THE MOST, YOU

02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:48.046
KNOW, SO I THINK THAT HURTS

02:09:48.113 --> 02:09:48.981
THEM MORE THAN A SPANKING. SO I

02:09:49.047 --> 02:09:50.816
WAS TELLING TONY, LIKE, YOU

02:09:50.883 --> 02:09:52.284
KNOW, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THESE

02:09:52.351 --> 02:09:53.852
ARE LAWS ALREADY. YOU KNOW,

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.087
THIS THIS HAS BEEN A LAW. IT

02:09:55.154 --> 02:09:58.357
HASN'T CHANGED. I MEAN, CYNTHIA

02:09:58.423 --> 02:10:02.761
GÓMEZ WAS WITH THE. GOVERNOR

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:04.963
BROWN AT THE TIME WHEN WHEN SHE

02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.831
WAS TRYING TO PASS THIS, HE

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:07.799
DIDN'T WANT TO PASS IT. THEN

02:10:07.866 --> 02:10:09.234
AFTER HE LEFT, IT PASSED. AND,

02:10:09.301 --> 02:10:10.302
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE STORY

02:10:10.369 --> 02:10:11.837
WHERE IT STARTS. SHE'S TULA

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:13.372
RIVER, BY THE WAY, TOO. SO, YOU

02:10:13.438 --> 02:10:14.873
KNOW, I MEAN, AND SHE WAS UP

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.408
THERE DOING THIS STUFF, DOING

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:17.743
THIS FIGHT BEFORE. SO THAT'S

02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:19.178
THE OTHER REASON WHY I STOPPED.

02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:20.913
I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HER NAME

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:22.181
OUT WHEN I TALK, BECAUSE, YOU

02:10:22.247 --> 02:10:23.782
KNOW, THIS IS WHERE IT ALL

02:10:23.849 --> 02:10:26.451
COMES FROM. AND ANYWAYS, I WAS

02:10:26.518 --> 02:10:27.019
TELLING TONY THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:10:27.085 --> 02:10:28.353
THESE LAWS, MAN, THEY BREAKING

02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:30.122
THE LAW. YOU KNOW, IF WE BREAK

02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:32.724
THE LAW, WE GET FINED. AND IF I,

02:10:32.791 --> 02:10:34.927
IF I SPEED, I, I GOT TO PAY. I

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:37.129
DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:38.030
MY TICKET IS NOW, BUT BECAUSE

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:40.933
THEY ADD UP. BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S

02:10:40.999 --> 02:10:42.701
IT'S A LOT, YOU KNOW, BUT THESE

02:10:42.768 --> 02:10:44.436
GUYS NEVER GET SUSPENDED FROM

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:45.971
SCHOOL FROM FROM THEIR

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:48.173
POSITIONS. THEY NEVER GET FINED.

02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:50.175
THEY NEVER HAVE TO PAY NOTHING.

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:51.710
THEY JUST KEEP GETTING TO TREAT

02:10:51.777 --> 02:10:54.513
OUR KIDS AND WHATEVER MINORITY

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.381
KIDS OR EVEN EVEN THE PROBABLY

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:58.116
THE LITTLE WHITE KID THAT DON'T

02:10:58.183 --> 02:11:00.452
PAY ATTENTION TO THEM, THEY GET

02:11:00.519 --> 02:11:02.187
TO TREAT THEM, YOU KNOW,

02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:03.989
HOWEVER THEY WANT TO. AND SO,

02:11:04.056 --> 02:11:05.324
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NEVER NO

02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:07.192
PUNISHMENT FOR THEM. THEY NEVER

02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:09.428
HAVE TO. THEY NEVER HAVE TO

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:10.028
HAVE PUNISHMENT LIKE OUR KIDS,

02:11:10.095 --> 02:11:11.930
YOU KNOW, THEY NEVER HAVE TO.

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:13.098
WHATEVER THEY SAY GOES, YOU

02:11:13.165 --> 02:11:15.033
KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THEY CALLED

02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:17.002
BELLA, YOU KNOW, TOLD HER SHE

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:18.770
WAS MARIA. SHE'S GOING TO BE

02:11:18.837 --> 02:11:20.005
CALLED MARIA BECAUSE SHE LOOKS

02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:22.341
LIKE A MARIA, NOT A BELLA, YOU

02:11:22.407 --> 02:11:24.977
KNOW. SO THAT STUFF MAKES ME,

02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:26.511
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO GET

02:11:26.578 --> 02:11:27.746
ALL REST BECAUSE RAMOS GETS

02:11:27.813 --> 02:11:28.981
SCARED OF ME WHEN I START

02:11:29.047 --> 02:11:30.716
TALKING RACE. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:32.851
THAT STUFF MAKES ME WANT TO DO

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:33.952
STUFF TO PEOPLE. YOU MEAN

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:35.220
BECAUSE I STILL AM REYES. I'M

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:36.922
NOT. I MEAN, MAYBE THE CHAIRMAN,

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:38.123
BUT I'M FROM TULA RIVER, MAN.

02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:40.559
AND SO, YOU KNOW, THAT STUFF

02:11:40.626 --> 02:11:41.760
DON'T TAKE EASY WITH ME, YOU

02:11:41.827 --> 02:11:44.896
KNOW? SO. YOU KNOW. SO I THINK

02:11:44.963 --> 02:11:46.031
THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE FINED

02:11:46.098 --> 02:11:48.433
OR LOSE THEIR JOBS OR SOME KIND

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:50.002
OF CONSEQUENCES HAVE TO HAPPEN

02:11:50.068 --> 02:11:51.203
FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NEVER

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:52.971
GOING TO STOP BECAUSE NOTHING

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:53.905
HAPPENS TO THE KID THAT THAT

02:11:53.972 --> 02:11:55.407
YOU DON'T DO NOTHING TO.

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:57.009
THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCES, NO

02:11:57.075 --> 02:11:58.143
PUNISHMENT, YOU KNOW? SO I

02:11:58.210 --> 02:11:59.044
THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, FINDING

02:11:59.111 --> 02:12:01.079
THEM OR GIVING THEM SOME DAYS

02:12:01.146 --> 02:12:02.314
OFF OR EVEN FIRING THEM, YOU

02:12:02.381 --> 02:12:04.049
KNOW, I MEAN, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:05.917
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EDUCATE

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:06.818
THE EDUCATORS, YOU KNOW WHAT I

02:12:06.885 --> 02:12:09.154
MEAN? THEY SHOULD BE ASKING US

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:10.055
OR THEY SHOULD BE TELLING,

02:12:10.122 --> 02:12:11.990
TELLING US IF WE CAN COME TO

02:12:12.057 --> 02:12:13.892
THEIR INSTITUTIONS AND AND LET

02:12:13.959 --> 02:12:15.260
THEM KNOW, YOU KNOW, HOW WE

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:16.962
FEEL AS TRIBAL PEOPLE. YOU KNOW

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:18.864
HOW HOW WE'VE BEEN TREATED AS

02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:20.565
TRIBAL PEOPLE. SO IT CAN STOP

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:21.867
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WITHOUT NO

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:23.101
AWARENESS. THERE'S NO THERE'S

02:12:23.168 --> 02:12:25.637
NO STOPPING NOTHING. AND

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:26.171
WITHOUT NO PUNISHMENT, NO

02:12:26.238 --> 02:12:27.406
CONSEQUENCES, THERE'S NO

02:12:27.472 --> 02:12:29.007
STOPPING NOTHING. SO THAT'S

02:12:29.074 --> 02:12:29.875
WHAT I WAS TALKING TO TONY

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.910
ABOUT. YOU MEAN ABOUT MAYBE,

02:12:31.977 --> 02:12:34.079
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS AS LAWMAKERS,

02:12:34.146 --> 02:12:36.982
YOU KNOW, AND AS LEGISLATORS TO

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:39.851
MAYBE PUT THAT IN SOME WORDING

02:12:39.918 --> 02:12:41.887
AND, YOU KNOW, MAKE THEM PAY.

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:43.522
BUT THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD

02:12:43.588 --> 02:12:44.089
HAVE TO PAY ANYWAYS WITHOUT

02:12:44.156 --> 02:12:45.891
THAT. BUT LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEY

02:12:45.957 --> 02:12:47.092
DON'T THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT

02:12:47.159 --> 02:12:47.959
THESE LAWS. YOU MEAN BECAUSE NO

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:49.895
ONE DOES NOTHING TO THEM? YOU

02:12:49.961 --> 02:12:51.196
KNOW, YOU GUYS MADE THEM AND

02:12:51.263 --> 02:12:52.698
THEY'RE STRONG, BUT THEY'RE NOT

02:12:52.764 --> 02:12:53.932
STRONG WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:55.934
ROOMS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT,

02:12:56.001 --> 02:12:57.035
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T THEY DON'T

02:12:57.102 --> 02:12:59.037
HAVE TO ABIDE TO THEM. WHEN WE

02:12:59.104 --> 02:13:00.772
WAS ON THAT, WHEN WE WAS ON

02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:02.074
THAT CALL, THAT ZOOM CALL, YOU

02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:03.942
KNOW, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:05.110
BELLA SPEAK BECAUSE THEY SAID

02:13:05.177 --> 02:13:05.877
THAT SHE WASN'T A SHE'S A

02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:07.813
STUDENT AND IT'S AGAINST THE

02:13:07.879 --> 02:13:09.748
LAW FOR HER TO SPEAK. SO I KEPT

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:10.916
PUTTING ON MUTE AND LETTING HER

02:13:10.982 --> 02:13:12.984
TELL ME WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY,

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:13.919
THEN UNMUTE, AND THEN I'D MAKE

02:13:13.985 --> 02:13:16.355
IT AT MY OWN WORDS AND THEN

02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:17.656
SLAM THEM A LITTLE BIT. AND

02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:18.857
THEY THEY ACT LIKE RAMOS AND

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:20.025
TONY WASN'T THEIR BOSS, YOU

02:13:20.092 --> 02:13:22.160
KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THEY THAT'S

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:23.261
HOW BAD THEY FELT. THAT LADY

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:24.930
SAID SHE FELT ATTACKED. HOW DO

02:13:24.996 --> 02:13:26.264
YOU THINK BELLA FELT SINCE HER

02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:28.166
SINCE HER FRESHMAN YEAR? I MEAN,

02:13:28.233 --> 02:13:29.534
AND THIS LADY FEELS ATTACKED

02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:31.069
FOR 30 MINUTES ON A ZOOM CALL,

02:13:31.136 --> 02:13:32.938
YOU KNOW, AND THEN. AND THEN

02:13:33.004 --> 02:13:35.040
SHE TRY TO BAIL OUT OF IT, YOU

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:36.708
KNOW? AND THE CRAZY PART ABOUT

02:13:36.775 --> 02:13:39.077
IT IS THAT THEY SOLD OUT TRIBAL

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:40.545
LEADERS THAT TOLD THEM THAT IT

02:13:40.612 --> 02:13:42.814
WAS OKAY, YOU KNOW, NOT TO NAME

02:13:42.881 --> 02:13:44.983
ANYBODY. BUT WE HEARD IT, RAMOS,

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:46.885
YOU KNOW, AND SO THAT'S THAT'S

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:48.086
WHERE IT'S THAT'S WHERE IT'S

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:50.055
WRONG, TOO. IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,

02:13:50.122 --> 02:13:52.290
I MEAN, US AS LEADERS, WHEN

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:52.924
WE'RE HELPING SOMEBODY, WE

02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:54.993
SHOULD ALL BE THERE. YOU KNOW,

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.828
THE NRA'S THERE MAKING MOVES.

02:13:56.895 --> 02:13:57.929
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE STRONG. THEY

02:13:57.996 --> 02:14:00.232
GET TO KEEP THEIR GUNS. THEY

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:01.933
GET TO KEEP THE WHICH I LIKE MY

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.268
GUN, TOO, AT HOME. BECAUSE, YOU

02:14:03.335 --> 02:14:04.736
KNOW, I NEVER KNOW WHEN

02:14:04.803 --> 02:14:06.571
MOUNTAIN LIONS ARE GOING TO BE

02:14:06.638 --> 02:14:08.607
AROUND OR, OR AT THE PRACTICE,

02:14:08.673 --> 02:14:09.708
THE SECOND AMENDMENT. BUT, YOU

02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:12.411
KNOW. THEY'RE STRONG. YOU KNOW,

02:14:12.477 --> 02:14:13.912
I MEAN, THE PROBLEM WITH US IS

02:14:13.979 --> 02:14:16.014
THAT, YOU KNOW, LIKE RAMOS, HE

02:14:16.081 --> 02:14:16.982
HE GOES THROUGH THE BASTION ALL

02:14:17.048 --> 02:14:18.884
THE TIME. YOU MEAN FROM OTHER

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:20.152
TRIBES? YOU KNOW, HE'S THE ONLY

02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:21.920
ONE UP THERE WITH YOU GUYS IN

02:14:21.987 --> 02:14:23.889
SACRAMENTO, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO

02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:24.890
DO ALL THESE THINGS THAT HE

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:26.725
DOES. YOU MEAN THAT'S WHY I

02:14:26.792 --> 02:14:27.893
STAND BY HIM? WHETHER HE'S

02:14:27.959 --> 02:14:29.127
WHETHER HE'S WHETHER HE'S WRONG

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:30.762
FOR TULE RIVER OR NOT. I STILL

02:14:30.829 --> 02:14:31.997
GOT TO STAND BY HIM BECAUSE

02:14:32.063 --> 02:14:34.366
HE'S THE ONLY ONE I KNOW UP

02:14:34.433 --> 02:14:35.767
THERE. YOU KNOW, HE'S THE ONLY

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:37.302
ONE. THAT'S ME. HE'S THE ONLY

02:14:37.369 --> 02:14:38.770
ONE THAT'S THE SAME AS ME. YOU

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:39.971
KNOW, WE'RE THE SAME PEOPLE,

02:14:40.038 --> 02:14:41.039
EVEN THOUGH WE COME FROM

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:42.974
DIFFERENT AREAS. BUT THAT'S HOW

02:14:43.041 --> 02:14:44.276
I SEE INDIAN COUNTRY. AND TELL

02:14:44.342 --> 02:14:45.977
SOMEONE DON'T WANT TO BE FROM

02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:47.212
THE SAME PLACE. I WANT TO BE

02:14:47.279 --> 02:14:48.814
FROM, YOU KNOW. BUT I TRUST

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.382
BIGFOOT AND I TRUST THE OTHER

02:14:50.449 --> 02:14:52.017
PEOPLE UP THERE, YOU KNOW WHAT

02:14:52.083 --> 02:14:53.752
I MEAN? SO, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST

02:14:53.819 --> 02:14:54.920
GLAD THAT YOU GUYS ARE HERE

02:14:54.986 --> 02:14:57.122
TODAY TO HEAR US IN OUR OWN, IN

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:59.090
OUR OWN LANDS. I MEAN, COME

02:14:59.157 --> 02:14:59.991
FROM COME FROM DOWN THE WAY A

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:01.960
LITTLE BIT TO FROM THE

02:15:02.027 --> 02:15:03.161
MOUNTAINS. YOU MEAN THE

02:15:03.228 --> 02:15:04.029
MOUNTAINS OF KETTLEMAN. SO, YOU

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:05.964
KNOW, THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY

02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:06.898
TOO MUCH IS THAT, YOU KNOW, I

02:15:06.965 --> 02:15:08.900
THINK THESE GUYS NEED TO BE

02:15:08.967 --> 02:15:10.035
PUNISHED. THEY SHOULD BE SOME

02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:11.236
CONSEQUENCES FOR THEM. THAT'S

02:15:11.303 --> 02:15:12.871
THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GOING TO

02:15:12.938 --> 02:15:13.905
LEARN. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU

02:15:13.972 --> 02:15:15.674
GOT TO TAKE THE BELT OUT AND

02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:16.908
SPANK THEM, YOU KNOW? BUT YOU

02:15:16.975 --> 02:15:19.110
GUYS GOT THE BELT. YOU KNOW, WE

02:15:19.177 --> 02:15:20.712
DON'T. SO YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE

02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:22.914
YOU GUYS. AND I WANT TO TAKE UP

02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:24.282
TWO MORE MUCH MORE TIME. BUT

02:15:24.349 --> 02:15:25.951
YOU KNOW THANK BELLA AND OTHERS

02:15:26.017 --> 02:15:27.919
THAT ARE STRONGEST HERE BECAUSE

02:15:27.986 --> 02:15:29.921
IF SHE DIDN'T DO THIS ON THE

02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:31.122
NEXT BELLA THAT AIN'T STRONG

02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:33.325
ENOUGH TO TO SPEAK. I ALWAYS

02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:34.826
TELL HER NO ONE'S GOING TO HEAR

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:37.729
HER, YOU KNOW. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:15:37.796 --> 02:15:39.831
SHE STOOD UP AND OTHERS JUMPED

02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:42.267
ON THERE WITH HER. AND YOU KNOW,

02:15:42.334 --> 02:15:43.802
THEY COULD SAY THAT THEY WAS

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:45.837
THERE IN THE BEGINNING WITH HER,

02:15:45.904 --> 02:15:48.406
BUT SHE WAS ALL ALONE WHEN I

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:50.175
FOUND HER. SO. AND I'M GLAD

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:51.810
THAT WE GOT SOMEBODY TO BE

02:15:51.877 --> 02:15:53.912
AROUND HER. ALMOST. THANK YOU.

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:56.348
MAN. I APPRECIATE YOU, SIR.

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:59.050
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR THAT

02:15:59.117 --> 02:16:01.253
TESTIMONY. AND SURELY IT IT IS,

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:03.688
AS YOU WERE SCROLLING THROUGH

02:16:03.755 --> 02:16:06.424
AND THE FACEBOOK STOPPED AT

02:16:06.491 --> 02:16:09.427
BELLA'S ISSUE. CERTAINLY WE

02:16:09.494 --> 02:16:10.929
WERE ALSO IN A POSITION DURING

02:16:10.996 --> 02:16:12.998
THIS TIME TO LEND HELP AND

02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:14.833
SUPPORT. SO IT ALL WORKED

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:18.103
TOGETHER. NOW WHERE DO WE GO?

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:18.970
RIGHT? AND WHERE DO WE MOVE

02:16:19.037 --> 02:16:21.206
FORWARD? HOW DO WE WE TAKE

02:16:21.273 --> 02:16:22.874
THESE ISSUES AND CONTINUE TO

02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:24.342
DRIVE THAT VOICE OF INDIAN

02:16:24.409 --> 02:16:26.945
PEOPLE? AND SO I WANT TO THANK

02:16:27.012 --> 02:16:28.446
YOU ALL FOR FOR YOUR

02:16:28.513 --> 02:16:30.248
TESTIMONIES HERE AS NOW WE OPEN

02:16:30.315 --> 02:16:31.182
IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY

02:16:31.249 --> 02:16:32.684
QUESTIONS, ANY QUESTIONS.

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:34.953
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIDEON, JUST

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.221
QUICKLY, AND I APPRECIATE

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:37.756
EVERYONE AGAIN FOR BEING HERE.

02:16:37.822 --> 02:16:40.091
ALL THE TESTIMONY AND VERY

02:16:40.158 --> 02:16:43.228
ENLIGHTENING FOR ME. I GUESS MY

02:16:43.295 --> 02:16:44.996
MY ONE QUESTION IS THERE WAS A

02:16:45.063 --> 02:16:47.365
LOT OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.

02:16:47.432 --> 02:16:49.334
THERE WERE SOME THEMES THAT RAN

02:16:49.401 --> 02:16:53.238
THROUGH EVERY ONE OF YOUR YOUR

02:16:53.305 --> 02:16:55.006
COMMENTS, BUT TAKING A STEP

02:16:55.073 --> 02:16:56.875
BACK AND TO CHAIRMAN RAMOS

02:16:56.942 --> 02:16:58.944
POINT ABOUT ONE VOICE OR THE

02:16:59.010 --> 02:17:02.914
VOICE OF THE NATIVE, THE NATIVE

02:17:02.981 --> 02:17:04.215
AMERICAN POPULATION THROUGHOUT

02:17:04.282 --> 02:17:06.184
CALIFORNIA, HAVE WE HAVE WE

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:07.385
EVER CONSIDERED GETTING TRIBAL

02:17:07.452 --> 02:17:10.255
LEADERS ACROSS THE BOARD HERE

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:12.123
TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY PUT

02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:13.992
FORWARD A PLAN OF ACTION? AND

02:17:14.059 --> 02:17:15.961
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. AND

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:17.829
MAYBE THIS IS THE FIRST STEP OF

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:20.532
WHAT REFORMS OR WHAT STEPS

02:17:20.599 --> 02:17:21.700
SPECIFICALLY ON EDUCATION THAT

02:17:21.766 --> 02:17:23.835
YOU WOULD LIKE TO UNIVERSALLY

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:26.037
SEE. EVERY TRIBE IS GOING TO BE

02:17:26.104 --> 02:17:26.771
DIFFERENT. EVERY FAMILY IS

02:17:26.838 --> 02:17:28.039
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. EVERY

02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:29.107
STUDENT IS DIFFERENT. WE

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:30.842
UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OF YOU MADE

02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:31.943
THAT POINT, I THINK, VERY

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.878
CLEARLY, BUT I THINK THAT THERE

02:17:33.945 --> 02:17:35.180
ARE GOING TO BE SOME THEMES AND

02:17:35.246 --> 02:17:36.748
SOME COMMONALITIES THAT EACH OF

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.950
THE TRIBES AND EACH LEADER HERE

02:17:39.017 --> 02:17:40.185
COULD AGREE ON, AND WHETHER

02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:40.986
THAT'S THREE POINTS, WHETHER

02:17:41.052 --> 02:17:42.120
THAT'S FIVE POINTS, WHETHER

02:17:42.187 --> 02:17:44.489
THAT'S TEN POINTS. I THINK THAT

02:17:44.556 --> 02:17:45.256
HELPS US PUSH LEGISLATION. SO

02:17:45.323 --> 02:17:47.325
HAVE WE CONSIDERED DOING THAT?

02:17:47.392 --> 02:17:49.194
AND MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:51.196
THAT CHAIRMAN RAMOS HAS

02:17:51.262 --> 02:17:53.164
DISCUSSED WITH YOU, BUT I'D BE

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:53.965
CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER THERE'S

02:17:54.032 --> 02:17:56.234
AN APPETITE TO DO THAT AND

02:17:56.301 --> 02:18:02.674
WHETHER YOU THINK THAT'S DOABLE.

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:05.877
I THINK IT'S A. EXCUSE ME. CAN

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:07.746
YOU HEAR ME? I THINK IT'S VERY

02:18:07.812 --> 02:18:09.848
MUCH DOABLE, BUT I THINK THE

02:18:09.914 --> 02:18:11.850
YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH CHAIRMAN

02:18:11.916 --> 02:18:13.852
NEIL. THERE HAS TO BE

02:18:13.918 --> 02:18:14.953
CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE THIS IS

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:17.756
NOT THE ONLY ISSUE THAT US

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:20.258
NATIVES HAVE TO DEAL WITH. YOU

02:18:20.325 --> 02:18:21.826
KNOW, THE IGNORANCE IS NOT AN

02:18:21.893 --> 02:18:24.329
EXCUSE AT THIS POINT, BECAUSE

02:18:24.396 --> 02:18:27.132
EVERY ISSUE THAT SEEMS TO BE A

02:18:27.198 --> 02:18:30.035
NATIVE ISSUE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE

02:18:30.101 --> 02:18:31.870
SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. BUT THE

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:34.606
PLAN OF ACTION SHOULD BE

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:35.974
EQUALITY AND WHAT THAT LOOKS

02:18:36.041 --> 02:18:38.443
LIKE FOR EACH TRIBE. YOU KNOW

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:39.778
THAT THAT MAY LOOK A LITTLE BIT

02:18:39.844 --> 02:18:42.147
DIFFERENT, BUT FOR US, EQUALITY

02:18:42.213 --> 02:18:43.815
AS HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD BE OF

02:18:43.882 --> 02:18:47.318
THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO ANYONE,

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:48.053
WHETHER IT BE A SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:18:48.119 --> 02:18:50.188
OR OR A PERSON WALKING DOWN THE

02:18:50.255 --> 02:18:52.123
STREET. THE THE PLAN OF ACTION

02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.924
SHOULD BE US FIRST TO

02:18:52.991 --> 02:18:55.560
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.

02:18:55.627 --> 02:18:56.895
NOW THERE'S 109 FULLY

02:18:56.961 --> 02:18:59.330
RECOGNIZED TRIBES HERE IN

02:18:59.397 --> 02:19:01.066
CALIFORNIA, AND SOMETIMES WE

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:01.866
CAN'T EVEN AGREE AMONGST OUR

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:05.704
OWN FAMILY MEMBERS. SO. BUT,

02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:06.971
BUT THE PLAN OF ACTION SHOULD

02:19:07.038 --> 02:19:09.741
BE THE EQUALITY OF OF THE

02:19:09.808 --> 02:19:10.942
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO

02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:13.311
HAVE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE

02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:16.781
ENTITIES LIKE THIS, DO THIS TO

02:19:16.848 --> 02:19:19.150
OUR YOUTH, IN THIS CASE, CLOVIS

02:19:19.217 --> 02:19:20.885
UNIFIED, AND WE'RE NOT ON THE

02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:22.120
SAME PAGE. IT DOES CREATE A

02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:24.656
DIVISION. IT DOES CREATE A

02:19:24.723 --> 02:19:25.190
DIVIDE AND CONQUER TYPE OF

02:19:25.256 --> 02:19:27.726
ATMOSPHERE FOR THEM. BUT I

02:19:27.792 --> 02:19:30.028
THINK TO TO CHAIRMAN NIETO'S

02:19:30.095 --> 02:19:31.896
POINT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S THERE

02:19:31.963 --> 02:19:33.765
SHOULD BE CONSEQUENCES. AND I

02:19:33.832 --> 02:19:34.933
THINK THAT'S WHERE LIKE HOW HE

02:19:34.999 --> 02:19:37.035
SAID I LIKE THE ANALOGY. YOU

02:19:37.102 --> 02:19:39.204
GUYS HAVE THE BELT. YOU KNOW, I

02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:40.038
THINK THAT I MEAN, I DO 100%

02:19:40.105 --> 02:19:42.073
AGREE WITH THAT ANALOGY BECAUSE

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:45.076
IT IS IT IS IN LAW AND IT'S IN

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:46.711
2025, AND WE'RE HAVING THE SAME

02:19:46.778 --> 02:19:48.913
CONVERSATIONS WE HAD, YOU KNOW,

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:50.715
30, 40 YEARS AGO. SO THE

02:19:50.782 --> 02:19:52.884
COMMUNICATION NEEDS TO BE A

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:54.085
LITTLE BIT BETTER. BUT THE

02:19:54.152 --> 02:19:55.153
PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.322
YOU IS, IS OF THE UTMOST

02:19:57.388 --> 02:19:58.990
IMPORTANCE. AND TO HAVE THE

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:00.792
WE'RE ALMOST AND THE MEMBERS

02:20:00.859 --> 02:20:01.926
MEMBERS HERE TO HAVE THAT

02:20:01.993 --> 02:20:03.828
CONVERSATION AND PUT INTO LAW

02:20:03.895 --> 02:20:07.398
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. TRIBES

02:20:07.465 --> 02:20:08.166
AGAIN NEED TO BE HEAVILY

02:20:08.233 --> 02:20:12.270
INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS. THANK

02:20:12.337 --> 02:20:14.239
YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. SO YEAH,

02:20:14.305 --> 02:20:17.308
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO

02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:18.910
HAVE A BOARD. I THINK WE YOU

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:21.012
KNOW, AS YOU POINTED OUT, WE'RE

02:20:21.079 --> 02:20:22.313
ALL WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT. WE ALL

02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:23.148
HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT

02:20:23.214 --> 02:20:25.083
IMPACT US. BUT WE DO HAVE

02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:26.684
COMMONALITIES. AND I DO THINK

02:20:26.751 --> 02:20:28.019
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE CREATED

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:29.888
SOME REGIONAL BOARDS THAT COME

02:20:29.954 --> 02:20:30.822
TOGETHER. AND THEN THEY WORK

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:32.791
DIRECTLY WITH SACRAMENTO,

02:20:32.857 --> 02:20:34.058
BECAUSE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE

02:20:34.125 --> 02:20:35.994
MADE IN SACRAMENTO IMPACT ALL

02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:37.829

02:22:45.189 --> 02:22:46.190
LAW BY THIS GOVERNOR, AND THAT

02:22:46.257 --> 02:22:47.892
POSITION, AFTER MANY YEARS NOW

02:22:47.959 --> 02:22:50.461

ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP,

02:22:57.101 --> 02:22:59.003
OUR ABILITY TO TEACH THAT

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:00.238
FUTURE GENERATION, TO GET THEM

02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:02.140

A REPRESENTATIVE ON THAT BOARD

02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:18.690
WAS WHY WE WORKED SO HARD TO

02:23:18.756 --> 02:23:19.891
GET THAT LAW SIGNED, BUT NOW

02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:22.293

HAVE HERE IN FRESNO COUNTY.

02:23:54.158 --> 02:23:57.328
WHAT OPPORTUNITY DO WE HAVE TO

02:23:57.395 --> 02:23:59.764
GET BEFORE THEM TO ASK THEM THE

02:23:59.831 --> 02:24:02.200
TOUGH QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY GET

02:24:02.266 --> 02:24:03.134
INTO THOSE SEATS OF POWER? HOW

02:24:03.201 --> 02:24:05.803
DO WE ENSURE THAT THEY

02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:07.105
ULTIMATELY WILL RESPECT WHAT

02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:09.807
WAS DECIDED UPON, WHAT

02:24:09.874 --> 02:24:12.010

02:24:12.076 --> 02:24:13.745
THAT AS A MODEL ACROSS OUR

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.079
ENTIRE COUNTY? SO YOU'RE NOT

02:24:15.146 --> 02:24:17.215

SUPERINTENDENTS WHO MIGHT FEEL

02:24:21.085 --> 02:24:23.888
A BIT DIFFERENTLY. FINALLY, IF

02:24:23.955 --> 02:24:26.591

HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

BEING CULTURALLY AND

02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:01.993
LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT, NOT

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:04.862
ONLY IS IMPORTANT, IT BUILDS

02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:07.031
TRUST AND IT ADDRESSES

02:25:07.098 --> 02:25:08.900
DISPARITIES. AND THE DATA

02:25:08.966 --> 02:25:10.968
SPEAKS ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW TO BE

02:25:11.035 --> 02:25:12.770
HAPPENING ON TOO MANY OF OUR

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:13.938
TRIBAL NATIONS. AND IT'S

02:25:14.005 --> 02:25:15.173
INCUMBENT ON US TO HOLD SPACES

02:25:15.239 --> 02:25:17.108
WHERE WE CAN HAVE THOSE TYPES

02:25:17.175 --> 02:25:18.876
OF CONVERSATIONS. AND I LOOK

02:25:18.943 --> 02:25:20.711

MUCH. I DID JUST WANT TO

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:30.922
COMMENT, ASSEMBLYMAN, THAT I

02:25:30.988 --> 02:25:33.057
DID IN FACT APPLY FOR THE

02:25:33.124 --> 02:25:33.925
POSITION TO SIT ON THE BOARD

02:25:33.991 --> 02:25:35.893
FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN CONSERVANCY.

02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:37.695
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT, I

02:25:37.762 --> 02:25:38.863
APPLIED TWICE. SO I'M NOT

02:25:38.930 --> 02:25:40.498
EXACTLY SURE WHAT HAPPENED WITH

02:25:40.565 --> 02:25:42.133
MY APPLICATION. SO IF ANYBODY

02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:43.768
COULD MAYBE FOLLOW UP AND THEN

02:25:43.835 --> 02:25:45.002
FOLLOW BACK UP WITH ME, THAT

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:47.371
WOULD BE GREAT. WHAT BOARD IS

02:25:47.438 --> 02:25:49.040
THAT? JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY,

02:25:49.107 --> 02:25:53.177
SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY.

02:25:53.244 --> 02:25:54.979
AND YOU APPLIED TWICE AND YOU

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:57.949
WEREN'T. YEAH. RESPONDED TWICE

02:25:58.015 --> 02:26:00.318
ONLINE. AND I EVEN MAILED IN

02:26:00.384 --> 02:26:02.286
THE PACKET. SO AS IT STATES ON

02:26:02.353 --> 02:26:03.921
THE WEBSITE, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU

02:26:03.988 --> 02:26:04.989
APPLY. SO I DID INDEED APPLY

02:26:05.056 --> 02:26:09.293
FOR THE POSITION. SO MAYBE IT

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:10.194
JUST GOT LOST ALONG THE WAY.

02:26:10.261 --> 02:26:14.765
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT. THANK YOU

02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:16.434

TRIBAL LEADERS HERE TODAY

EXPRESSING THEIR PERSPECTIVES

02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:26.844
ON SUCH A SENSITIVE TOPIC. A

02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:29.380
COUPLE OF POINTS THAT I WOULD

02:26:29.447 --> 02:26:31.215
LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AND MAYBE

02:26:31.282 --> 02:26:33.117
SOME IDEAS TO FLOAT IN TERMS OF

02:26:33.184 --> 02:26:35.520
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:26:35.586 --> 02:26:37.288
AND ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD HERE

02:26:37.355 --> 02:26:41.559
FOR, FOR SO LONG. TO START OFF

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:44.228
WITH THE EDUCATION COMPONENT,

02:26:44.295 --> 02:26:46.230
WE ARE AWARE THAT ACROSS THE

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:49.233
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THERE IS A

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:51.802
TEACHER SHORTAGE, AND WE ARE

02:26:51.869 --> 02:26:54.672
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF

02:26:54.739 --> 02:26:57.041
EVALUATING A BETTER PLAN

02:26:57.108 --> 02:26:58.576
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THAT

02:26:58.643 --> 02:26:59.777
SHORTAGE THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS.

02:26:59.844 --> 02:27:01.979
AND I THINK THERE IS AN

02:27:02.046 --> 02:27:04.115
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ALSO

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:07.285
INCLUDE A SPECIFIC PROGRAM, A

02:27:07.351 --> 02:27:11.622
PIPELINE THAT IS RELATABLE TO

02:27:11.689 --> 02:27:14.125
THE TOPICS DISCUSSED HERE TODAY.

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:16.527
REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S FIRST

02:27:16.594 --> 02:27:20.231
PEOPLE, AS A MEASURE TO BE USED

02:27:20.298 --> 02:27:23.034
FORWARD IN ENHANCING THAT

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:24.468
PARTICULAR TOPIC THROUGH

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:26.304
CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH, NOT ONLY

02:27:26.370 --> 02:27:27.772
SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA FIRST

02:27:27.838 --> 02:27:30.474
PEOPLES YOUTH. ON ANOTHER POINT,

02:27:30.541 --> 02:27:31.809
CHAIRMAN CISCO, APPRECIATE YOU

02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:32.944
BRINGING UP THE RELIGIOUS

02:27:33.010 --> 02:27:35.079
FREEDOM ACT AND THE FACT THAT

02:27:35.146 --> 02:27:39.383
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF

02:27:39.450 --> 02:27:40.718
MEASURING WHAT QUALIFIES AND

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:43.020
WHAT DOESN'T. RIGHT. AND I

02:27:43.087 --> 02:27:44.722
THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:27:44.789 --> 02:27:47.458
ALL HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT

02:27:47.525 --> 02:27:49.126
AS WELL, AND UNDERSTAND THAT

02:27:49.193 --> 02:27:51.996
THE DEFINITIONS OF WHAT THAT IS

02:27:52.063 --> 02:27:55.099
VARY FROM CULTURE AND, AND

02:27:55.166 --> 02:27:57.435
BACKGROUND. RIGHT. AND I THINK

02:27:57.501 --> 02:27:58.836
ACCEPTING THAT IS WHAT'S MOST

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:00.104
IMPORTANT. SO APPRECIATE YOU

02:28:00.171 --> 02:28:02.473
BRINGING UP THAT POINT. AND

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:05.943
LASTLY, CHAIRMAN NIETO, I'M

02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.645
ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT THE

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:08.879
CURRENT SUPERINTENDENT OF

02:28:08.946 --> 02:28:12.850
INSTRUCTION IS A PARTNER AND

02:28:12.917 --> 02:28:14.151
INFORMED OF THE CURRENT ISSUES.

02:28:14.218 --> 02:28:16.721
BUT I ALSO THINK MOVING FORWARD,

02:28:16.787 --> 02:28:19.056
THESE ISSUES AND TOPICS NEED TO

02:28:19.123 --> 02:28:20.691
BE INTEGRATED INTO THE PLATFORM

02:28:20.758 --> 02:28:22.893
OF THAT SPECIFIC OFFICE TO

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.161
ENSURE THAT IN PERPETUITY,

02:28:24.228 --> 02:28:26.464
THESE ISSUES ARE AT THE

02:28:26.530 --> 02:28:27.164
FOREFRONT OF DISCUSSIONS, AND

02:28:27.231 --> 02:28:29.533
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CHANGES

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:30.868
IN THAT SPACE HERE IN THE NEAR

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:33.237
FUTURE. AND I WILL BE AN

02:28:33.304 --> 02:28:35.172
ADVOCATE TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS

02:28:35.239 --> 02:28:37.541
A PART OF THE PLAN MOVING

02:28:37.608 --> 02:28:39.910
FORWARD. THANK YOU. WELL, THANK

02:28:39.977 --> 02:28:44.282
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS

02:28:44.348 --> 02:28:47.084
AND QUESTIONS. CERTAINLY WITH

02:28:47.151 --> 02:28:48.853
THE LEADERSHIP AND THE PANEL

02:28:48.919 --> 02:28:51.289
THAT'S HERE. CHAIRWOMAN, YOU

02:28:51.355 --> 02:28:52.757
TALKED ABOUT THE EDUCATIONAL

02:28:52.823 --> 02:28:54.925
SYSTEM, A BETTER EDUCATIONAL

02:28:54.992 --> 02:28:56.694
SYSTEM TO MOTIVATE OUR KIDS.

02:28:56.761 --> 02:28:59.163
AND IT WAS SAID HERE ON THE

02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:00.197
PANEL FROM ONE OF THE SPEAKERS

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:02.833
THAT WE ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE IT A

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:05.069
BETTER PLACE FOR OUR FOR OUR

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:06.604
YOUTH, FOR OUR GRANDKIDS, FOR

02:29:06.671 --> 02:29:07.872
THOSE MOVING FORWARD. BUT IT'S

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:10.041
TIME THAT WE START TO MAKE THE

02:29:10.107 --> 02:29:11.208
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM A BETTER

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:13.077
EXPERIENCE THAN WHAT WE

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:14.712
EXPERIENCED. GOING THROUGH IT

02:29:14.779 --> 02:29:17.081
AND SEEING AND HEARING THE

02:29:17.148 --> 02:29:18.783
TESTIMONY HERE AND THOSE THAT

02:29:18.849 --> 02:29:21.886
HAD TO GET INVOLVED, SHOWS THAT

02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:23.754
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS HAVE COME A

02:29:23.821 --> 02:29:25.956
LONG WAY, BUT YET THEIR

02:29:26.023 --> 02:29:28.759
TREATMENT TOWARDS OUR PEOPLE

02:29:28.826 --> 02:29:31.962
HASN'T CHANGED VERY MUCH ALONG

02:29:32.029 --> 02:29:34.832
THE WAY ITSELF. AGAIN, WE NEED

02:29:34.899 --> 02:29:37.702
TO LOOK AT THAT. AND EVERY ONE

02:29:37.768 --> 02:29:39.870
OF US ON THIS DAIS, WE DO TRY

02:29:39.937 --> 02:29:41.305
TO MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE FOR,

02:29:41.372 --> 02:29:42.907
FOR, FOR OUR LOVED ONES. THE

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:45.409
NEXT THAT GOES INTO THESE

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:47.845
POSITIONS OR EVEN IN LIFE. BUT

02:29:47.912 --> 02:29:49.413
ARE WE ACTUALLY TAKING THAT

02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:51.716
INTO PERSPECTIVE ON ALL OF THE

02:29:51.782 --> 02:29:53.084
ASPECTS OF LIFE? RIGHT. NOT

02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:55.252
JUST A BETTER JOB, A BETTER

02:29:55.319 --> 02:29:56.053
OPPORTUNITY, A BETTER HOME,

02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:57.855
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS, BUT A

02:29:57.922 --> 02:29:59.323
BETTER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAN

02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:00.858
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH. I

02:30:00.925 --> 02:30:04.128
REMEMBER WHEN WHEN I WAS IN THE

02:30:04.195 --> 02:30:05.329
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT, WE WERE

02:30:05.396 --> 02:30:07.298
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND WE

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:08.065
HAD TO WALK FROM THE

02:30:08.132 --> 02:30:08.833
RESERVATION DOWN THE WASH AND

02:30:08.899 --> 02:30:11.969
GO INTO THE SCHOOLS. AND ONE OF

02:30:12.036 --> 02:30:12.770
THE TEACHERS ASKED US, THEY

02:30:12.837 --> 02:30:15.139
PLAYED A DRUM SONG, AND THEN

02:30:15.206 --> 02:30:17.041
THEY ASKED, WHO'S INDIAN? WE

02:30:17.108 --> 02:30:17.875
RAISED OUR HAND AND THEY SAID,

02:30:17.942 --> 02:30:20.010
WELL, I INTERPRET THE SONG. WE

02:30:20.077 --> 02:30:21.245
SAID, WELL, THAT'S NOT OUR

02:30:21.312 --> 02:30:22.913
TRADITION. WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:24.081
AND RATHER THAN BE OPEN ABOUT

02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:26.117
IT, THEY SAID, WELL, SIT DOWN,

02:30:26.183 --> 02:30:28.152
YOU MUST NOT BE INDIAN ENOUGH.

02:30:28.219 --> 02:30:29.253
AND SO THE STATEMENT THAT'S

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:31.222
MAKING IT A BETTER EXPERIENCE

02:30:31.288 --> 02:30:32.957
FOR US THAN WHEN WE WENT

02:30:33.023 --> 02:30:34.058
THROUGH SCHOOL IS REALLY

02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:35.860
RESONATING WITH ME, BECAUSE

02:30:35.926 --> 02:30:38.629
HAVE WE DID ENOUGH TO CHANGE

02:30:38.696 --> 02:30:41.132
THAT EXPERIENCE? AND MY

02:30:41.198 --> 02:30:43.267
COLLEAGUES HERE WITH US AND

02:30:43.334 --> 02:30:45.002
MANY IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:30:45.069 --> 02:30:48.005
CONTINUE TO BE THE MOST

02:30:48.072 --> 02:30:49.840
DIVERSIFIED CAUCUS IN, IN, IN

02:30:49.907 --> 02:30:52.176
THE, IN THE NATION, BUT YET,

02:30:52.243 --> 02:30:54.111
ARE WE REALLY MAKING IT A

02:30:54.178 --> 02:30:55.780
BETTER PLACE AND RAISING TO THE

02:30:55.846 --> 02:30:59.116
LEVEL OF, OF OUR NATIVE

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:00.518
AMERICAN PEOPLE, OF CALIFORNIA

02:31:00.584 --> 02:31:02.753
INDIANS FIRST PEOPLE AND THE

02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:05.089
CHALLENGES THAT STILL GO ON

02:31:05.156 --> 02:31:09.226
TODAY? AND AND IT WAS SAID THAT

02:31:09.293 --> 02:31:11.128
IT'S ONE THING TO HONOR ON THE

02:31:11.195 --> 02:31:12.930
FLOOR, WHICH WE DID A GREAT

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:14.965
DEAL AND HONORING PEOPLE, BUT

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:15.900
WE SHOULD BE HONORING

02:31:15.966 --> 02:31:16.967
CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE EVERY

02:31:17.034 --> 02:31:19.069
DAY OF THE YEAR. EVERY DAY WE

02:31:19.136 --> 02:31:20.871
WAKE UP ON THIS LAND THAT WE'RE

02:31:20.938 --> 02:31:22.106
ON HERE TODAY, EVERY LAND THAT

02:31:22.173 --> 02:31:24.008
WE WAKE UP TO, EVERY LAND THAT

02:31:24.074 --> 02:31:26.110
WE REPRESENT IS TRADITIONALLY

02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:27.945
SOMEONE'S TERRITORY. SO ARE WE

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:29.847
DOING ENOUGH TO MOVE FORWARD

02:31:29.914 --> 02:31:32.116
AND MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE FOR

02:31:32.183 --> 02:31:33.684
CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE THAN

02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:36.454
WHAT IT WAS WHEN THE STATE WAS

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:37.888
CREATED? AND WE KNOW THE

02:31:37.955 --> 02:31:39.323
HISTORY THERE, AND WE'RE NOT

02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:41.091
GOING TO GO TOO FAR INTO THAT.

02:31:41.158 --> 02:31:42.827
BUT THAT'S A CHALLENGE THAT I

02:31:42.893 --> 02:31:45.930
THINK WE'RE TAKING BACK TO THE

02:31:45.996 --> 02:31:46.964
LEGISLATURE AND ALL THE

02:31:47.031 --> 02:31:48.098
DIFFERENT ROLES AND DIFFERENT

02:31:48.165 --> 02:31:48.933
COMMITTEES THAT WE SIT ON

02:31:48.999 --> 02:31:51.035
KEEPING THAT INSTILLED IN US.

02:31:51.101 --> 02:31:54.939
AND THERE SHOULD BE THOSE THAT

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:58.476
THAT ARE CAUSING CONTEMPORARY

02:31:58.542 --> 02:32:00.845
TRAUMA TO OUR TO OUR YOUTH BY

02:32:00.911 --> 02:32:03.314
DENYING THEM THE RIGHT TO WEAR

02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:04.715
REGALIA, BY QUESTIONING THEIR

02:32:04.782 --> 02:32:06.750
AUTHORITY, BY CHANGING THEIR

02:32:06.817 --> 02:32:08.385
NAMES TO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE

02:32:08.452 --> 02:32:10.521
APPROPRIATE. AND THAT GOES BACK

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:11.956
TO THE ASSIMILATION POLICIES.

02:32:12.022 --> 02:32:14.592
AND YET THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

02:32:14.658 --> 02:32:19.263
STRIVED AND AND CREATE IT AND,

02:32:19.330 --> 02:32:21.298
AND PASS THE TEST OF THE

02:32:21.365 --> 02:32:23.000
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO

02:32:23.067 --> 02:32:24.802
GRADUATE. THEY PASSED ALL THOSE

02:32:24.869 --> 02:32:27.004
THINGS TO GET THERE. SHOULD

02:32:27.071 --> 02:32:28.372
THERE BE DISCIPLINE, DISCIPLINE

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:30.808
TO THOSE THAT THAT ARE CAUSING

02:32:30.875 --> 02:32:33.711
TRAUMATIC MENTAL ANGUISH? OTHER

02:32:33.777 --> 02:32:35.980
AREAS WE KNOW IN THE WORKPLACE,

02:32:36.046 --> 02:32:36.881
AND WE'VE ALL SEEN BILLS THAT

02:32:36.947 --> 02:32:38.516
COME THROUGH ON DIFFERENT

02:32:38.582 --> 02:32:40.251
WORKPLACE AND DIFFERENT THINGS

02:32:40.317 --> 02:32:41.252
WHERE PEOPLE ARE HELD

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:41.952
ACCOUNTABLE. MAYBE IT'S

02:32:42.019 --> 02:32:43.954
SOMETHING THAT WE START TO, TO,

02:32:44.021 --> 02:32:47.925
TO LOOK AT. WE ALSO AND MY

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:50.094
COLLEAGUE, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:51.762
VALENCIA, BROUGHT IT UP. IF

02:32:51.829 --> 02:32:55.699
OTHERS ARE BEING. AFFORDED THE

02:32:55.766 --> 02:32:57.902
OPPORTUNITY TO WEAR THEIR

02:32:57.968 --> 02:33:00.271
REGALIA, TRADITIONAL REGALIA

02:33:00.337 --> 02:33:01.171
WITHOUT EVEN BEING QUESTIONED,

02:33:01.238 --> 02:33:03.541
WITH NO FORMS BEING HAVING TO

02:33:03.607 --> 02:33:05.876
SIGN, WHY ARE NATIVE AMERICAN

02:33:05.943 --> 02:33:07.111
PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:10.481
CALIFORNIA NOT OFFERED THAT

02:33:10.548 --> 02:33:13.050
SAME OPPORTUNITY? MAYBE IT IS

02:33:13.117 --> 02:33:14.852
TIME THAT WE GO BACK AND RELOOK

02:33:14.919 --> 02:33:17.254
AT HERE IN THE STATE OF

02:33:17.321 --> 02:33:20.124
CALIFORNIA, STATUTE LEGISLATION

02:33:20.190 --> 02:33:21.692
THAT REAFFIRMS RELIGIOUS

02:33:21.759 --> 02:33:24.028
FREEDOM ACT FOR ALL, FOR NATIVE

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:25.896
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND INCLUDE

02:33:25.963 --> 02:33:28.198
THEM IN IN THAT THAT'S EMBEDDED

02:33:28.265 --> 02:33:30.234
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I

02:33:30.301 --> 02:33:31.368
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:33:31.435 --> 02:33:33.370
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE BACK FROM

02:33:33.437 --> 02:33:35.673
THIS, THIS HEARING AND MOVING

02:33:35.739 --> 02:33:38.976
FORWARD. AND IT IS TRUE THAT,

02:33:39.043 --> 02:33:40.744
YOU KNOW, WHEN THESE THINGS

02:33:40.811 --> 02:33:42.947
STARTED COMING OUR WAY AND, YOU

02:33:43.013 --> 02:33:44.815
KNOW, A LOT OF CHAIRS HERE KNOW

02:33:44.882 --> 02:33:46.951
THAT WHEN ISSUES COME TO US AND

02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:48.786
WE'RE ENGAGED IN IT FROM THE

02:33:48.852 --> 02:33:51.221
BEGINNING, WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE A

02:33:51.288 --> 02:33:52.756
BETTER OUTCOME OF SOME OF THE

02:33:52.823 --> 02:33:54.858
POLICIES THAT COME THROUGH THE

02:33:54.925 --> 02:33:55.926
STATE LEGISLATURE. THIS

02:33:55.993 --> 02:33:57.761
PARTICULAR ISSUE CAME TO US

02:33:57.828 --> 02:33:59.096
BECAUSE OF THE FRIENDSHIPS THAT

02:33:59.163 --> 02:34:01.832
WE'VE HAD AND SEEN WHAT'S GOING

02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:03.834
ON IN INDIAN COUNTRY, AND WE

02:34:03.901 --> 02:34:06.403
WERE ABLE TO TACKLE THAT, AND

02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:07.738
WE DID MOVE FORWARD ON STATUTE.

02:34:07.805 --> 02:34:09.039
THAT'S GOING TO BE IN FRONT OF

02:34:09.106 --> 02:34:10.975
THE GOVERNOR HERE IN THE NEXT

02:34:11.041 --> 02:34:12.776
COUPLE OF WEEKS. BUT IS IT

02:34:12.843 --> 02:34:14.011
ALWAYS GOING TO TAKE THAT WHAT

02:34:14.078 --> 02:34:16.113
HAPPENS? AND AND I HAVE TO

02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:17.982
CHALLENGE THE LEGISLATURE. IT

02:34:18.048 --> 02:34:20.150
HAS BEEN HAPPENING. IT DIDN'T

02:34:20.217 --> 02:34:22.286
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TOOK ONE OF

02:34:22.353 --> 02:34:23.954
US TO GET ELECTED FROM THE

02:34:24.021 --> 02:34:24.688
CALIFORNIA INDIAN COMMUNITY TO

02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:26.890
START TO BRING MORE AWARENESS

02:34:26.957 --> 02:34:28.659
AROUND THESE ISSUES. AND SO WE

02:34:28.726 --> 02:34:30.561
HAVE TO CHALLENGE THE

02:34:30.628 --> 02:34:31.028
LEGISLATURE IN ALL THE

02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:31.962
DIFFERENT POSITIONS THAT WE ARE.

02:34:32.029 --> 02:34:33.297
CERTAINLY WE GOT FRIENDS AND

02:34:33.364 --> 02:34:35.199
ALLIES HERE, BUT WE SIT ON

02:34:35.265 --> 02:34:35.833
DIFFERENT COMMITTEES,

02:34:35.899 --> 02:34:37.067
COMMITTEES THAT DIRECT POLICY

02:34:37.134 --> 02:34:39.103
ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

02:34:39.169 --> 02:34:41.438
I THINK PART OF THAT WHICH I'M

02:34:41.505 --> 02:34:43.507
LEAVING EVERYWHERE, NOT ONLY

02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:45.309
EDUCATION, BUT WITHIN WATER,

02:34:45.376 --> 02:34:47.277
WITHIN THE INSURANCE, WITHIN

02:34:47.344 --> 02:34:49.046
ALL THESE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT

02:34:49.113 --> 02:34:51.115
WE'RE INVOLVED IN. ARE WE

02:34:51.181 --> 02:34:53.283
MAKING IT A BETTER PLACE FOR

02:34:53.350 --> 02:34:54.918
CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE?

02:34:54.985 --> 02:34:56.820
THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT WE

02:34:56.887 --> 02:34:57.988
SHOULD TAKE BACK WITH US AND

02:34:58.055 --> 02:34:59.990
THE DIFFERENT POLICIES IN THE

02:35:00.057 --> 02:35:00.824
DAYS COMING FORWARD. I WANT TO

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.826
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY

02:35:02.893 --> 02:35:04.228
MOVING FORWARD AND BRINGING A

02:35:04.294 --> 02:35:06.563
LOT OF THESE ISSUES TO LIGHT,

COMMENT, PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU

02:35:11.101 --> 02:35:13.637
HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK AT THE

02:35:13.704 --> 02:35:15.105
PODIUM HERE. TWO MINUTES AND

02:35:15.172 --> 02:35:19.810
THEN WE'LL CUT YOU OFF. GOOD

02:35:19.877 --> 02:35:22.479
MORNING. GOOD. IS IT ON? THERE

02:35:22.546 --> 02:35:23.814
WE GO. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:27.084
LORETTA TOOL AND I AM NEZ PERCE

02:35:27.151 --> 02:35:29.253
FROM IDAHO. THAT'S WHERE I GREW

02:35:29.319 --> 02:35:30.220
UP ON AN INDIAN RESERVATION IN

02:35:30.287 --> 02:35:33.090
IDAHO. BUT TODAY I AM ONE OF

02:35:33.157 --> 02:35:34.892
THE MANY MILLION PEOPLE, TRIBAL

02:35:34.958 --> 02:35:37.061
FOLKS WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:35:37.127 --> 02:35:38.595
AND I AM A CALIFORNIA URBAN

02:35:38.662 --> 02:35:41.732
INDIAN, AND I NOW LIVE ON THE

02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:44.435
OF SAN MANUEL NATION LANDS. A

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:46.036
HOMELANDS OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:47.938
RAMOS IN REDLANDS. I ALWAYS

02:35:48.005 --> 02:35:49.773
TEASE AND SAY IT'S THE RED

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:52.142
LANDS. IT'S OUR TRIBAL LANDS IN

02:35:52.209 --> 02:35:54.111
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT IN MY

02:35:54.178 --> 02:35:56.013
VERY LONG CAREER IN FEDERAL

02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:58.115
INDIAN LAW AND POLICY, ONE OF

02:35:58.182 --> 02:35:59.750
THE JOBS I SERVED ON WAS THE

02:35:59.817 --> 02:36:01.051
MAJORITY STAFF DIRECTOR AND

02:36:01.118 --> 02:36:02.119
CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE INDIAN

02:36:02.186 --> 02:36:04.054
AFFAIRS COMMITTEE IN WASHINGTON,

02:36:04.121 --> 02:36:04.922
DC. AND WHEN I FIRST GOT TO

02:36:04.988 --> 02:36:07.291
WASHINGTON, THEY HAD JUST

02:36:07.357 --> 02:36:08.025
CHANGED THE NAME FROM THE

02:36:08.092 --> 02:36:09.159
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INDIAN

02:36:09.226 --> 02:36:10.994
AFFAIRS TO THE FULL COMMITTEE

02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:13.630
ON INDIAN AFFAIRS. SO I WANT TO

02:36:13.697 --> 02:36:15.966
INSPIRE YOU, CHAIRMAN RAMOS,

02:36:16.033 --> 02:36:17.134
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

02:36:17.201 --> 02:36:20.370
ASSEMBLY, TO SEEK TO MOVE

02:36:20.437 --> 02:36:22.773
BEYOND SELECT, SELECT. IT'S

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:25.175
IT'S AMAZING THAT THIS IS THE

02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:26.176
FRAMEWORK AND THE FOUNDATION,

02:36:26.243 --> 02:36:27.878
BUT WE NEED TO BE A FULL

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:29.313
COMMITTEE WITH THE SAME RIGHTS

02:36:29.379 --> 02:36:31.014
AND RESPONSIBILITY AS OTHERS

02:36:31.081 --> 02:36:32.816
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GENERALLY

02:36:32.883 --> 02:36:35.452
INHERENTLY KNOWN TO THE MEMBERS

02:36:35.519 --> 02:36:37.888
OF THE HÌ DELEGATION IN

02:36:37.955 --> 02:36:39.490
CALIFORNIA, BE IT ON THE SENATE

02:36:39.556 --> 02:36:40.858
SIDE OR ASSEMBLY SIDE, THAT

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:42.259
THEY HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY

02:36:42.326 --> 02:36:44.061
TO INDIAN COUNTRY, THAT WE ARE

02:36:44.128 --> 02:36:47.264
NOT JUST D.E.I. DIVERSITY,

02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:48.098
EQUITY AND INCLUSION. AND WE

02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:51.268
ARE EMBODYING THAT, BUT WE HAVE

02:36:51.335 --> 02:36:52.970
A POLITICAL STATUS. WE ARE IN

02:36:53.036 --> 02:36:54.304
THE CONSTITUTION THAT MAKES US

02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:55.939
DIFFERENT. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN

02:36:56.006 --> 02:36:57.708
HAVE A COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AND

02:36:57.775 --> 02:36:59.777
NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS HERE IN

02:36:59.843 --> 02:37:02.045
CALIFORNIA. AND I, I REALLY

02:37:02.112 --> 02:37:02.880
BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE TO START

02:37:02.946 --> 02:37:04.915
THINKING ABOUT SUCCESSION FROM

02:37:04.982 --> 02:37:07.351
YOURSELVES. JAMES RAMOS IS

02:37:07.417 --> 02:37:08.886
BUILT THE FOUNDATION AND YOU

02:37:08.952 --> 02:37:10.120
HAVE BEEN THERE TO HELP BUILD

02:37:10.187 --> 02:37:11.989
IT. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, HAVING

02:37:12.055 --> 02:37:14.925
SERVED IN THE CONGRESS WITH

02:37:14.992 --> 02:37:15.893
MEMBERS ON BOTH THE HOUSE AND

02:37:15.959 --> 02:37:17.861
SENATE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

02:37:17.928 --> 02:37:19.029
LOT OF NATIVE AMERICANS. SO

02:37:19.096 --> 02:37:20.798
WHAT WE LOOK FOR IS TO EDUCATE

02:37:20.864 --> 02:37:23.901
EACH MEMBER ABOUT THE ROLE AND

02:37:23.967 --> 02:37:24.668
RESPONSIBILITY, BECAUSE WE

02:37:24.735 --> 02:37:25.969
CAN'T ALWAYS HAVE A JAMES RAMOS

02:37:26.036 --> 02:37:28.138
IN THE ASSEMBLY OR IN YOUR

02:37:28.205 --> 02:37:29.873
SENATE. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:31.108
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:37:31.175 --> 02:37:33.043
THAT'S THEIR DUTY TO DO IT AS

02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.944
WELL. AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR

02:37:34.011 --> 02:37:35.813
BEING HERE BECAUSE YOU ARE

02:37:35.879 --> 02:37:36.947
BUILDING THE FOUNDATION THAT I

02:37:37.014 --> 02:37:38.849
HOPE WILL GROW TO REALLY CHANGE

02:37:38.916 --> 02:37:39.917
THE OUTLOOK HERE FOR THE

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:41.185
MILLION PLUS NATIVE AMERICANS

02:37:41.251 --> 02:37:42.953
WHO LIVE IN THIS STATE. AND WE

02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:44.855
DESERVE TO HAVE A VOICE NOT

02:37:44.922 --> 02:37:45.989
ONLY THROUGH THE TRIBAL NATIONS

02:37:46.056 --> 02:37:47.858
OF 109, BUT ME AS A CITIZEN

02:37:47.925 --> 02:37:50.060
HERE IN THIS STATE. AND I BRING

02:37:50.127 --> 02:37:52.262
MY SOVEREIGNTY WITH ME. AND THE

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:53.897
TRIBES ONLY HELP AMPLIFY THE

02:37:53.964 --> 02:37:55.098
STATE. AND I THANK YOU FOR

02:37:55.165 --> 02:37:56.867
HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY, THIS

02:37:56.934 --> 02:37:58.001
HISTORIC HEARING. AND I LOOK

02:37:58.068 --> 02:37:59.937
FORWARD TO SEEING YOU BEING A

02:38:00.003 --> 02:38:00.871
FULL COMMITTEE ON NATIVE

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:02.973
AMERICAN AFFAIRS. THANK YOU.

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:08.278
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.

02:38:08.345 --> 02:38:11.048
ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT? STATE

02:38:11.114 --> 02:38:14.718
YOUR NAME. REBOZOS JACKIE VAN

02:38:14.785 --> 02:38:16.920
HUSS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF

02:38:16.987 --> 02:38:18.722
STRATEGIC GROWTH FOR THE

02:38:18.789 --> 02:38:19.957
NATIONAL BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS

02:38:20.023 --> 02:38:22.626
OF AMERICA NATIVE SERVICES. I'M

02:38:22.693 --> 02:38:23.760
PROUD TO SAY WE HAVE 17 TRIBAL

02:38:23.827 --> 02:38:25.929
BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS IN THE

02:38:25.996 --> 02:38:28.432
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND I'M

02:38:28.498 --> 02:38:28.966
THE FORMER CHAIRPERSON AND

02:38:29.032 --> 02:38:31.034
TRIBAL CITIZEN OF NORTH FORK

02:38:31.101 --> 02:38:32.736
RANCHERIA OF MONO INDIANS. SO I

02:38:32.803 --> 02:38:34.905
PREPARED THIS TO START. OUR

02:38:34.972 --> 02:38:37.040
EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO

02:38:37.107 --> 02:38:38.308
UNDERSTAND THAT WITH CALIFORNIA

02:38:38.375 --> 02:38:39.910
TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS, THERE IS A

02:38:39.977 --> 02:38:41.778
VAST TAPESTRY OF GOVERNMENTAL

02:38:41.845 --> 02:38:42.946
STRUCTURES. THERE'S NO SINGLE

02:38:43.013 --> 02:38:45.215
MODEL. EACH TRIBE'S GOVERNMENT

02:38:45.282 --> 02:38:46.783
REFLECTS ITS UNIQUE HISTORY,

02:38:46.850 --> 02:38:49.253
TRADITIONS, AND CULTURAL VALUES.

02:38:49.319 --> 02:38:49.953
SOME TRIBES MAINTAIN

02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:52.155
TRADITIONAL FORMS OF GOVERNANCE

02:38:52.222 --> 02:38:52.890
ROOTED IN ANCIENT CUSTOMS AND

02:38:52.956 --> 02:38:55.659
PRACTICES. OTHERS HAVE ADOPTED

02:38:55.726 --> 02:38:57.127
MODERN STRUCTURES INCORPORATING

02:38:57.194 --> 02:38:58.962
ELEMENTS OF WESTERN STYLE

02:38:59.029 --> 02:39:00.864
DEMOCRACY. THE DIVERSITY IS A

02:39:00.931 --> 02:39:02.666
TESTAMENT TO THE RESILIENCE AND

02:39:02.733 --> 02:39:04.334
ADAPTABILITY OF NATIVE AMERICAN

02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:05.936
CULTURES. UNDERSTANDING THIS

02:39:06.003 --> 02:39:08.639
DIVERSITY IS KEY TO

02:39:08.705 --> 02:39:09.840
COMPREHENDING THE COMPLEXITIES

02:39:09.907 --> 02:39:11.074
OF NATIVE AMERICAN INDIGENOUS

02:39:11.141 --> 02:39:12.676
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND OUR

02:39:12.743 --> 02:39:15.679
YOUTH. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO AVOID

02:39:15.746 --> 02:39:16.980
GENERALIZATIONS WHEN SCHOOL

02:39:17.047 --> 02:39:18.949
DISTRICTS LÀ LOCAL EDUCATION

02:39:19.016 --> 02:39:20.017
AGENCIES AND THE STATE

02:39:20.083 --> 02:39:21.885
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND

02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:23.921
STAFF AT OUR LOCAL SCHOOL

02:39:23.987 --> 02:39:25.155
DISTRICTS ARE CONSULTING WITH

02:39:25.222 --> 02:39:27.024
TRIBES OR WORKING WITH OUR

02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:29.259
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES, WE ALL HAVE

02:39:29.326 --> 02:39:30.060
FACED NUMEROUS CHALLENGES, MANY

02:39:30.127 --> 02:39:31.828
OF WHICH ARE A LEGACY OF

02:39:31.895 --> 02:39:33.931
HISTORICAL INJUSTICES AND

02:39:33.997 --> 02:39:36.066
TRAUMA AND ONGOING SYSTEMIC

02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:37.901
INEQUITIES, MANY THAT CONTINUE

02:39:37.968 --> 02:39:40.003
TODAY, WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD

02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:42.005
FROM BELLA GARCIA AS AN EXAMPLE

02:39:42.072 --> 02:39:43.240
WITH THE CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL

02:39:43.307 --> 02:39:44.808
DISTRICT, SPECIFICALLY CLOVIS

02:39:44.875 --> 02:39:46.944
HIGH SCHOOL AND HER WEARING OF

02:39:47.010 --> 02:39:48.111
REGALIA AT HER HIGH SCHOOL

02:39:48.178 --> 02:39:50.380
GRADUATION. I PREVIOUSLY HAD

02:39:50.447 --> 02:39:52.416
ASSISTED HER SISTER GIA, TWO,

02:39:52.482 --> 02:39:54.885
TWO YEARS PRIOR TO BELLA AT THE

02:39:54.952 --> 02:39:57.254
SAME HIGH SCHOOL, THE SAME

02:39:57.321 --> 02:39:58.855
ISSUE, THE SAME LAW WAS IN

02:39:58.922 --> 02:40:02.125
EFFECT AT THAT TIME AT THE SAME

02:40:02.192 --> 02:40:03.961
SCHOOL, DENYING AND REQUIRING

02:40:04.027 --> 02:40:06.997
THE SAME FORM REQUIRING

02:40:07.064 --> 02:40:08.899
PICTURES. THE MEASUREMENTS OF

02:40:08.966 --> 02:40:10.667
THAT EAGLE FEATHER PRIOR TO

02:40:10.734 --> 02:40:12.903
APPROVING THIS ITEM AS AN

02:40:12.970 --> 02:40:15.372
ADORNMENT TO BE WORN ON JIA'S

02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:16.940
CAP. THEN, THIS LAST SCHOOL

02:40:17.007 --> 02:40:20.010
YEAR, HERE CAME BELLA'S SAME

02:40:20.077 --> 02:40:21.878
SITUATION. BUT THIS TIME WE

02:40:21.945 --> 02:40:23.880
TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY FACE

02:40:23.947 --> 02:40:25.782
THAT WITH MORE RIGOR, MORE

02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:27.050
VOICES. IT BECAME A COMMUNITY

02:40:27.117 --> 02:40:29.453
EFFORT. AS YOU HEARD TODAY ON

02:40:29.519 --> 02:40:30.787
THE PANELS, ALLOWED COMMUNITY

02:40:30.854 --> 02:40:33.991
EFFORT. AND WITH THE INDIGENOUS

02:40:34.057 --> 02:40:36.259
JUSTICE SILLS, CHAIRMAN NIETO

02:40:44.901 --> 02:40:46.970
THE LEAD OF OUR WONDERFUL,

02:40:47.037 --> 02:40:47.704
SUPPORTIVE NATIVE ASSEMBLY

02:40:47.771 --> 02:40:50.974

OUTCAST. SHE BRAVED BEING

02:40:56.513 --> 02:40:59.950
SHE PERSEVERED AND SHE HAS SET

02:41:00.017 --> 02:41:01.685
A PATH AHEAD FOR OTHER NATIVE

02:41:01.752 --> 02:41:03.420

REINFORCE THE LAWS THAT ARE

02:41:17.968 --> 02:41:18.869
STANDING TODAY, AND I THINK WE

02:41:18.935 --> 02:41:21.872

THURMAN ON THAT ZOOM CALL, THAT

02:41:23.673 --> 02:41:26.209
THERE HAS TO BE TEETH BEHIND,

02:41:26.276 --> 02:41:26.910
THAT. THERE HAS TO BE

02:41:26.977 --> 02:41:27.844
CONSEQUENCES. LIKE CHAIRMAN

02:41:32.015 --> 02:41:32.916
TIME AGAIN IS THAT THE SCHOOLS

02:41:32.983 --> 02:41:34.951
JUST STAND THERE. THEY DO WHAT

02:41:35.018 --> 02:41:36.853
THEY WANT TO DO. AND ASSEMBLY

IT'S GOING TO COME BEFORE THE

02:41:46.963 --> 02:41:48.999
AB 821 THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED

MANDATING THE INCLUSION OF

THEY HAD INDIAN AGENT TO HAVE A

02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:26.990

02:45:03.159 --> 02:45:04.227
AND PAYING TO THE FEDERAL

02:45:04.294 --> 02:45:06.796
GOVERNMENT. THOSE ARE THE

02:45:06.863 --> 02:45:07.964
INDIANS THAT HAVE POWER. THOSE

02:45:08.031 --> 02:45:10.066
ARE THE INDIANS THAT HAVE

02:45:10.133 --> 02:45:14.037
VOICES BECAUSE THEY PAY TAXES.

02:45:14.104 --> 02:45:16.973
THEY WANT TO VOTE AND HAVE A

02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:19.743
VOICE IN THIS GOVERNMENT. BUT

02:45:19.809 --> 02:45:21.911
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT FEDERALLY

02:45:21.978 --> 02:45:23.780

DIDN'T GET A WHOLE LOT OF

02:45:49.973 --> 02:45:52.976
SUPPORT BECAUSE IT'S WHEN YOU

02:45:53.043 --> 02:45:54.277
GO AGAINST THE COUNTY AND

02:45:54.344 --> 02:45:55.879
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ALL

NON-NATIVE PEOPLE, ENGINEERS,

RETIRED ASTROPHYSICS SCIENTISTS

02:46:12.762 --> 02:46:15.031
WHO KNEW OUR PLIGHT, WHO CAME

02:46:15.098 --> 02:46:18.335

AND THEY HELPED US WITH ALL

02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:26.943

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:28.945
NAILED THEM. AS TAXPAYERS IN

02:46:29.012 --> 02:46:31.448
OUR COMMUNITY. WE BEAT THAT

02:46:31.514 --> 02:46:32.949
PROJECT, AND THEY CAN'T MINE

02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:35.151

02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:40.824
BUT IT CAN HAPPEN. I HEARD

02:46:40.890 --> 02:46:42.425
TRIBAL CHAIRMAN TALK ABOUT THIS

02:46:42.492 --> 02:46:44.060
MINING PROJECT THAT FOR 100

02:46:44.127 --> 02:46:46.029
YEARS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

02:46:46.096 --> 02:46:47.297

02:46:51.301 --> 02:46:52.669
BECAUSE ONCE THEY MINE THAT IN

02:46:52.736 --> 02:46:53.903
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, YOU

02:46:53.970 --> 02:46:56.039
WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT A DIAMOND

02:46:56.106 --> 02:46:57.741
MINING PROJECT LOOKS LIKE. LOOK

02:46:57.807 --> 02:46:59.542
AT THOSE THAT ARE DONE IN

02:46:59.609 --> 02:47:02.779
AFRICA. THEY DIG FOR MILES.

02:47:02.846 --> 02:47:05.048
YOUR WATER RIGHTS. YOU WILL

02:47:05.115 --> 02:47:07.650
HAVE NO WATER. WE KNOW THIS

02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:08.952
BECAUSE WE EDUCATED OURSELVES.

02:47:09.018 --> 02:47:12.088
BUT MY SOLUTION THAT I OFFER

02:47:12.155 --> 02:47:16.059

NO, GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DONE

02:47:28.138 --> 02:47:32.242
RIGHT. WHAT I SAY HERE TODAY IN

02:47:32.308 --> 02:47:34.110
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:47:34.177 --> 02:47:36.112
RECOGNIZE ALL THE INDIAN PEOPLE

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:39.816
THAT ARE FROM THESE LANDS AS

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:42.752
STATE RECOGNIZED TRIBAL PEOPLE.

02:47:42.819 --> 02:47:44.988
WE MAY NOT HAVE THAT FEDERAL

02:47:45.054 --> 02:47:47.056
STATUS, BUT AT LEAST GIVE US

02:47:47.123 --> 02:47:48.792
THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:47:48.858 --> 02:47:51.027
RECOGNITION IN OUR STATE. AT

02:47:51.094 --> 02:47:52.996
LEAST THAT GIVES US A STARTING

02:47:53.062 --> 02:47:54.998
GROUND BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

02:47:55.064 --> 02:47:57.233
FEDERAL RECOGNITION PROCESS IS

02:47:57.300 --> 02:48:00.003
A 15 TO 20 YEAR PROJECT.

02:48:00.069 --> 02:48:02.972
DEPENDS ON WHO'S IN YOUR

02:48:03.039 --> 02:48:03.940
GOVERNMENT. WE KNOW WE WON'T

02:48:04.007 --> 02:48:04.908
GET THAT BECAUSE OF THE REGIME

02:48:04.974 --> 02:48:06.776
THAT'S NOW WE WATCH THE

02:48:06.843 --> 02:48:08.244
POLITICS. WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING

02:48:08.311 --> 02:48:11.815
ON TOO. BUT THOSE IN CALIFORNIA

02:48:11.881 --> 02:48:13.283
WOULD BE A SOLUTION BECAUSE

02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:14.884
THEN WE'D HAVE. YOU TALKED

02:48:14.951 --> 02:48:16.820
ABOUT VOTING POWER. THAT'S

02:48:16.886 --> 02:48:19.789
WHERE IT STARTS. WE AS INDIAN

02:48:19.856 --> 02:48:22.158
PEOPLE HAD TO EDUCATE OURSELVES

02:48:22.225 --> 02:48:22.926
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE VOTING

02:48:22.992 --> 02:48:25.061
POWER IN OUR COMMUNITIES MEAN A

02:48:25.128 --> 02:48:27.063
LOT. IT MEANS A LOT IN FUNDING.

02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:30.467
IT MEANS A LOT IN HAVING VOICE

02:48:30.533 --> 02:48:35.472
IN OUR STATE. AND AS FAR AS THE

02:48:35.538 --> 02:48:37.307
WATER RIGHTS AND GETTING THAT

02:48:37.373 --> 02:48:40.043

THAT'S ALL OLD GOOD OLD BOYS

02:48:48.384 --> 02:48:51.120

02:48:51.187 --> 02:48:52.989
CURRENT SUPERVISOR ON THERE

02:48:53.056 --> 02:48:54.891

02:48:59.963 --> 02:49:04.467
TO HELP OPENING HIS VOICE FOR

02:49:04.534 --> 02:49:06.169
OUR INDIAN PEOPLE HERE IN

02:49:06.236 --> 02:49:10.907
FRESNO COUNTY. BUT THERE'S A

02:49:10.974 --> 02:49:12.542
START THERE FOR US. WHEN YOU

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:14.878
LOOK AT THE TRUE FACTS OF WHAT

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:18.314
WE AS NONRECOGNIZED PEOPLE HAVE

02:49:18.381 --> 02:49:21.584
TO FIGHT FOR, WE HAVE TO FIGHT

02:49:21.651 --> 02:49:22.886
TRIPLE HARD. THIS SITUATION

02:49:22.952 --> 02:49:25.054
WITH THIS YOUNG LADY THAT

02:49:25.121 --> 02:49:26.756
HAPPENED TO US SO MANY TIMES,

02:49:26.823 --> 02:49:29.592
IT HAPPENED TO ME SO MANY TIMES.

02:49:29.659 --> 02:49:31.461
I'VE HAD TO LIVE WITH IT ALL MY

02:49:31.528 --> 02:49:33.997
LIFE, BUT IT NEVER STOPPED ME.

02:49:34.063 --> 02:49:35.231
AND IT WON'T STOP HER BECAUSE

02:49:35.298 --> 02:49:37.934
SHE GOT A HARSH EDUCATION. AND

02:49:38.001 --> 02:49:39.702
THAT'S AN EDUCATION THAT LIVES

02:49:39.769 --> 02:49:40.970
WITH YOU TILL THE DAY YOU'RE

02:49:41.037 --> 02:49:42.138
BORN. THAT'S WHAT MAKES DRIVES

02:49:42.205 --> 02:49:46.242
ME. BUT WHEN IN HEARING

02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:48.545
TESTIMONY AND THE CONCERNS,

02:49:48.611 --> 02:49:51.247
THERE IS A GREATER POWER FOR

02:49:51.314 --> 02:49:52.715
OUR INDIAN PEOPLE IN THE STATE

02:49:52.782 --> 02:49:54.851
OF CALIFORNIA, IF EVERYBODY WAS

02:49:54.918 --> 02:49:57.387
RECOGNIZED IN YOUR STATE AS

PARENTS TALKED ABOUT NATIVES.

02:55:19.075 --> 02:55:21.177
THIS IS HOW THEIR FAMILY TALKS

02:55:21.244 --> 02:55:22.945

SEGREGATIONS WE WE TALK ABOUT

02:55:39.195 --> 02:55:40.997

IT'S HAPPENING HERE NOW IN 2025.

02:55:57.780 --> 02:56:00.016
THEY JUST TOOK THE TITLE OF

AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT. WE

02:56:06.889 --> 02:56:08.858
HAVE TO STAND FOR OUR CHILDREN.

02:56:08.925 --> 02:56:11.160
THE TRIBAL LEADERS HERE, PAST

02:56:11.227 --> 02:56:12.929
TRIBAL LEADERS THAT SIT IN THIS

02:56:12.995 --> 02:56:15.164
ROOM, COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE

TALK WITH OUR PARENTS, BECAUSE

02:56:25.007 --> 02:56:27.209
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:56:27.276 --> 02:56:28.077
SUPPORT IN THE BACK. AND THEY

02:56:28.144 --> 02:56:30.046
DON'T WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP

02:56:30.112 --> 02:56:31.247
AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK

02:56:31.314 --> 02:56:33.416
TO THEIR CHILDREN. IT'S OKAY TO

02:56:33.482 --> 02:56:34.016
HAVE CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN,

02:56:34.083 --> 02:56:37.019
GREAT GRANDCHILDREN THAT EXCEED

02:56:37.086 --> 02:56:40.256
YOUR PERSONAL EDUCATION LEVEL.

02:56:40.323 --> 02:56:42.158
BECAUSE I SEE JANET, I REMEMBER

02:56:42.224 --> 02:56:43.893
JANET WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:45.528

SOFTBALL LIKE NO OTHER, AND I

02:56:47.763 --> 02:56:49.031
PLAYED WITH HER. AND THEN TO

02:56:49.098 --> 02:56:51.133
SEE HER FROM THAT LITTLE KID IN

02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:53.769
A STROLLER GROW UP TO BE THAT

02:56:53.836 --> 02:56:55.938
STRONG YOUNG WOMAN THAT SHE IS,

02:56:56.005 --> 02:56:58.441
AND STANDING UP AND HAVING A

02:56:58.507 --> 02:57:03.913
VOICE, IT'S. FOR THAT. SORRY,

02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:08.951
THAT MAKES ME FEEL CONFIDENT,

02:57:09.018 --> 02:57:11.821
STRONGER IN KNOWING THAT MY

02:57:11.887 --> 02:57:13.222

02:57:24.433 --> 02:57:27.169
CONTINUE. IT'S A SILENT MONSTER.

02:57:27.236 --> 02:57:28.904
I USED TO CALL IT WHEN MY KIDS

02:57:28.971 --> 02:57:30.973
WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. IT'S A

02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.675
CANCER. AND HOW DO YOU GET RID

02:57:32.742 --> 02:57:34.910

YOUR LIFE. YOU FIND A WAY TO

DO THEY WANT TO BE OUR FRIENDS?

02:58:45.915 --> 02:58:47.450

03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:26.341
TALK FOR US. THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

03:06:26.408 --> 03:06:28.410
THEY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR

03:06:28.477 --> 03:06:31.346
OWN BUSINESS. BUT LIKE MY

03:06:31.413 --> 03:06:34.216
COUSIN SAID, WE HAVE NO VOICE.

03:06:34.283 --> 03:06:35.884
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED IN THESE

03:06:35.951 --> 03:06:54.736
DOORS. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED.

03:06:59.341 --> 03:07:01.810
SITES.

03:07:01.877 --> 03:07:05.013
FOR SERVERS, CALTRANS. BUT

03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:08.250
THEY'RE ALL GONE NOW. MY

03:07:08.317 --> 03:07:09.685
GRANDMA WAS FROM HERE, ROSE

03:07:09.751 --> 03:07:12.788
WILLIAMS AND SOME OTHERS TOOK

03:07:12.854 --> 03:07:16.658
SOME ELDERS OUT OF THAT, OUT OF

03:07:16.725 --> 03:07:17.526
THAT MILLERTON LAKE BEFORE IT

03:07:17.593 --> 03:07:22.197
WAS FLOODED. YOU KNOW, MY

03:07:22.264 --> 03:07:23.732
FAMILY AND OUR PEOPLES BEEN IN

03:07:23.799 --> 03:07:26.935
THE SENSE OF START. AND NOW

03:07:27.002 --> 03:07:29.237
IT'S MY TURN TO STEP IN AND

03:07:29.304 --> 03:07:33.075
TALK FOR THESE LITTLE CHILDREN.

03:07:33.141 --> 03:07:34.977
THAT ARE NOT FULL BLOODED, THAT

03:07:35.043 --> 03:07:36.745
ARE NOT HALF BLOODED, THEY'RE

03:07:36.812 --> 03:07:39.448
NOT QUARTERS. SO BLOOD DOESN'T

03:07:39.514 --> 03:07:42.951
COUNT THE QUANTUM. ALL I ASK IS

03:07:43.018 --> 03:07:44.620
YOU KEEP THAT NATIVE AMERICAN

03:07:44.686 --> 03:07:46.154
AFFAIRS IS HIS NAME. BUT ONE

03:07:46.221 --> 03:07:49.458
DAY IT'S GOING TO BE INDIGENOUS

03:07:49.524 --> 03:07:54.730
NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS. THAT'S.

03:07:54.796 --> 03:07:58.000
AND THE FUNDING IS GOING TO BE

03:07:58.066 --> 03:07:59.868
TAKEN AWAY FROM ALL THE NATIVE

03:07:59.935 --> 03:08:02.371
PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW HERE. AND

03:08:02.437 --> 03:08:03.605
THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD IN THE

03:08:03.672 --> 03:08:05.907
SCHOOLS. ALSO, THEY'RE

03:08:05.974 --> 03:08:08.143
COMBINING OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS

03:08:08.210 --> 03:08:09.077
TO TAKE THAT MONEY AND THAT

03:08:09.144 --> 03:08:11.380
FUNDING TO USE IN DIFFERENT

03:08:11.446 --> 03:08:13.849
AREAS IN SCHOOLS. SO NOW THE

03:08:13.915 --> 03:08:15.017
LITTLE NATIVE KIDS DON'T GET TO

03:08:15.083 --> 03:08:16.818
GET THEIR FULL BENEFITS OF THAT

03:08:16.885 --> 03:08:18.787
MONEY COMING IN. SO WHERE IS

03:08:18.854 --> 03:08:20.355
THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THOSE

03:08:20.422 --> 03:08:21.757
LEADERS AND THOSE DISTRICTS OF

03:08:21.823 --> 03:08:24.192
BREAKING THE LAW OF USING THAT

03:08:24.259 --> 03:08:25.827
MONEY IN DIFFERENT AREAS? NOW

03:08:25.894 --> 03:08:26.561
THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR OWN

03:08:26.628 --> 03:08:30.699
TITLES ON THINGS, YOU KNOW, SO,

03:08:30.766 --> 03:08:32.868
YOU KNOW, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, IN

03:08:32.934 --> 03:08:34.670
YOUR OWN WORDS, WHAT ARE YOU

03:08:34.736 --> 03:08:36.772
GOING TO SAY TO THE PEOPLE THAT

03:08:36.838 --> 03:08:38.040
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE

03:08:38.106 --> 03:08:39.207
UNDERSTAND THAT THESE NATIVE

03:08:39.274 --> 03:08:44.046
PEOPLE DOWN HERE HAVE A ISSUE?

03:08:44.112 --> 03:08:47.115
HAVE A PROBLEM, BUT IT'S NOT

03:08:47.182 --> 03:08:49.584
OUR PROBLEM. IT'S NOT OUR ISSUE.

03:08:49.651 --> 03:08:51.920
IT'S THE SCHOOLS, THESE LEADERS

03:08:51.987 --> 03:08:53.288
AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE THAT

03:08:53.355 --> 03:08:55.857
ARE IN HIGHER SPOTS, THEIR

03:08:55.924 --> 03:08:58.860
RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT YET WE

03:08:58.927 --> 03:09:00.929
GOT THIS COMMUNITY. WE GO

03:09:00.996 --> 03:09:01.797
THROUGH CLOVIS WORLD, MAN, WE

03:09:01.863 --> 03:09:04.066
FEAR OUR LIVES. WE TELL OUR

03:09:04.132 --> 03:09:06.668
CHILDREN, DON'T GO TO CLOVIS.

03:09:06.735 --> 03:09:08.203
YOU MIGHT GET BEAT UP BY THE

03:09:08.270 --> 03:09:13.208
POLICE. WE KNOW THAT FROM

03:09:13.275 --> 03:09:15.077
EXPERIENCE. AND NOW WE'RE THE

03:09:15.143 --> 03:09:19.014
BAD INDIANS. OH, THERE GOES

03:09:19.081 --> 03:09:19.848
THOSE INDIANS AGAIN. THAT BIG

03:09:19.915 --> 03:09:23.351
UPROAR IN CLOVIS. HAVE YOU EVER

03:09:23.418 --> 03:09:26.488
BEEN TO A GRADUATION IN CLOVIS?

03:09:26.555 --> 03:09:28.156
YOU KNOW HOW MANY WHITE PEOPLE

03:09:28.223 --> 03:09:30.425
COME IN THERE WITH THEIR FLAGS

03:09:30.492 --> 03:09:32.527
AND THEIR AMERICAN COLORS AND

03:09:32.594 --> 03:09:34.496
ALL THESE THINGS, AND THEY SHOW

03:09:34.563 --> 03:09:38.200
THEIR POWER? SO A LOT OF NATIVE

03:09:38.266 --> 03:09:39.935
PEOPLE DIDN'T GO TO THOSE

03:09:40.001 --> 03:09:41.103
GRADUATIONS BECAUSE THEY DON'T

03:09:41.169 --> 03:09:42.704
WANT TO FEAR AND GET IN

03:09:42.771 --> 03:09:44.139
SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T WANT

03:09:44.206 --> 03:09:47.976
TO. SO, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A

03:09:48.043 --> 03:09:49.945
LOT TO THINK ABOUT FROM ALL

03:09:50.011 --> 03:09:51.179
THESE AREAS AND ALL THE TRIBAL

03:09:51.246 --> 03:09:52.948
LEADERS AND ALL THOSE PARENTS

03:09:53.014 --> 03:09:57.919
WE DO TOO. BUT THE VOICE IS NOT

03:09:57.986 --> 03:09:59.187
GETTING TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED

03:09:59.254 --> 03:10:01.790
TO BE, AND THE FUNDING IS NOT

03:10:01.857 --> 03:10:05.026
GETTING WHERE WE NEED IT. AND

03:10:05.093 --> 03:10:08.230
OUR RECOGNITION. I SAY BRING IT

03:10:08.296 --> 03:10:11.099
TO ALL NATIVE PEOPLE THROUGH

03:10:11.166 --> 03:10:13.101
CALIFORNIA LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED

03:10:13.168 --> 03:10:15.871
TO BE IN THE BEGINNING, SO WE

03:10:15.937 --> 03:10:17.973
CAN ALL STAND UP FOR OURSELVES

03:10:18.039 --> 03:10:19.808
AND NOT WORRY ABOUT OUR

03:10:19.875 --> 03:10:21.910
CAPABILITY OF HELPING OUR

03:10:21.977 --> 03:10:24.880
ELDERS OR OUR YOUTH. THANK YOU.

03:10:24.946 --> 03:10:27.849
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WE

03:10:27.916 --> 03:10:30.886
DO HAVE ANOTHER PANEL AFTER,

03:10:30.952 --> 03:10:34.289
BUT GO AHEAD. HUKE KELLY

03:10:34.356 --> 03:10:36.525
CARRILLO, TULE RIVER TRIBAL

03:10:36.591 --> 03:10:37.993
MEMBER. I KNOW WE HAVE LIMITED

03:10:38.059 --> 03:10:39.995
TIME, SO I'M JUST GOING TO SAY

03:10:40.061 --> 03:10:41.163
THREE QUICK POINTS THAT I

03:10:41.229 --> 03:10:42.798
WANTED TO MENTION REGARDING

03:10:42.864 --> 03:10:45.467
EDUCATION AND THE PANELISTS.

03:10:45.534 --> 03:10:47.435
THANK YOU, TRIBAL LEADERS, FOR

03:10:47.502 --> 03:10:49.971
SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE

03:10:50.038 --> 03:10:52.874
STUDENTS AND EDUCATION AND

03:10:52.941 --> 03:10:54.776
CONCERNS. THE FIRST ONE I JUST

03:10:54.843 --> 03:10:57.012
WANT TO MENTION IS THAT THERE'S

03:10:57.078 --> 03:10:58.847
A LOT OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:00.982
GOING ON, AND I THINK IF YOU

03:11:01.049 --> 03:11:04.052
SPEAK TO PROBABLY 99% OF

03:11:04.119 --> 03:11:04.920
AMERICAN INDIAN PEOPLE

03:11:04.986 --> 03:11:05.921
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

03:11:05.987 --> 03:11:07.489
CALIFORNIA, YOU'RE GOING TO

03:11:07.556 --> 03:11:09.224
HEAR THESE STORIES FROM

03:11:09.291 --> 03:11:11.226
OURSELVES, FROM OUR PARENTS AND

03:11:11.293 --> 03:11:12.027
FROM OUR GRANDPARENTS, OR

03:11:12.093 --> 03:11:14.830
EXAMPLES OF ALL, ALL OF OUR

03:11:14.896 --> 03:11:16.965
GENERATIONS THAT HAVE GONE ON.

03:11:17.032 --> 03:11:17.933
THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO SAY

03:11:17.999 --> 03:11:20.468
RELATES TO THAT AND NOT MUCH

03:11:20.535 --> 03:11:23.839
NEW OR DIFFERENT HAS CHANGED.

03:11:23.905 --> 03:11:26.074
THE ONLY THING WITH THESE

03:11:26.141 --> 03:11:27.843
ISSUES, THE ONLY THING IS THAT

03:11:27.909 --> 03:11:29.344
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS HAS A

03:11:29.411 --> 03:11:31.446
PLATFORM TO BRING THESE ISSUES

03:11:31.513 --> 03:11:34.115
FORWARD. BUT IN THE COMMUNITIES

03:11:34.182 --> 03:11:35.817
WE'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THESE

03:11:35.884 --> 03:11:37.152
AND EXPERIENCING THESE

03:11:37.219 --> 03:11:39.287
THROUGHOUT OUR GENERATIONS. THE

03:11:39.354 --> 03:11:41.890
THIRD POINT I JUST WANT TO SAY,

03:11:41.957 --> 03:11:43.325
REGARDING THE TRIBAL REGALIA

03:11:43.391 --> 03:11:46.294
AND BELLA GARCIA, FIRST OF ALL,

03:11:46.361 --> 03:11:48.129
I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN,

03:11:48.196 --> 03:11:50.565
BELLA, FOR HAVING THE COURAGE

03:11:50.632 --> 03:11:51.967
AND BEING AN EXAMPLE FOR OUR

03:11:52.033 --> 03:11:54.803
YOUTH. AND IT'S I JUST WANT TO

03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:55.971
MAKE A STATEMENT THAT IT'S

03:11:56.037 --> 03:11:57.105
UNFORTUNATE THAT SHE HAD TO

03:11:57.172 --> 03:11:58.707
SPEND HER SENIOR YEAR

03:11:58.773 --> 03:12:00.909
ADVOCATING FOR HERSELF, FOR A

03:12:00.976 --> 03:12:02.143
LAW THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE,

03:12:02.210 --> 03:12:04.079
FOR A RIGHT THAT IS ALREADY IN

03:12:04.145 --> 03:12:07.015
PLACE. WE'VE EXPERIENCED THIS

03:12:07.082 --> 03:12:08.817
NUMEROUS TIMES WITH FAMILY

03:12:08.884 --> 03:12:11.152
MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS

03:12:11.219 --> 03:12:13.855
THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY, AND I

03:12:13.922 --> 03:12:16.024
DID WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT ON

03:12:16.091 --> 03:12:16.925
THE EAGLE FEATHERS. WHEN EAGLE

03:12:16.992 --> 03:12:18.860
FEATHERS ARE ANY FEATHERS ARE

03:12:18.927 --> 03:12:19.828
GIVEN, THOSE ARE GIVEN AS A

03:12:19.895 --> 03:12:22.097
GIFT, AND THEY'RE GIVEN TO

03:12:22.163 --> 03:12:24.199
ACKNOWLEDGE A MILESTONE AND

03:12:24.266 --> 03:12:25.267
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

03:12:25.333 --> 03:12:26.401
ACCOMPLISHED. AND MAYBE AT

03:12:26.468 --> 03:12:27.936
GRADUATION, THAT COULD BE THE

03:12:28.003 --> 03:12:28.870
ONLY TIME THEY'VE EVER THE

03:12:28.937 --> 03:12:31.139
FIRST TIME THEY'VE RECEIVED AN

03:12:31.206 --> 03:12:32.974
EAGLE FEATHER. SO TO FILL OUT A

03:12:33.041 --> 03:12:36.945
FORM OR TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

03:12:37.012 --> 03:12:38.713
THEY'RE GOING TO USE FOR

03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:41.116
GRADUATION CAN BE IMPOSSIBLE

03:12:41.182 --> 03:12:43.785
AND EVEN DISRESPECTFUL TO

03:12:43.852 --> 03:12:45.520
FORESEE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

03:12:45.587 --> 03:12:47.188
BE GIVEN FROM THEIR FAMILY OR

03:12:47.255 --> 03:12:49.858
THEIR TRIBE OR THEIR COMMUNITY.

03:12:49.925 --> 03:12:52.027
AS A GIFT. I JUST WANT TO SAY

03:12:52.093 --> 03:12:54.062
THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR

03:12:54.129 --> 03:13:01.236
YOUR COMMENTS. ON. MY NAME IS

JEREMY BEALL. I'M ONO, I'M

03:13:03.204 --> 03:13:05.707
JOSHUA HOKAMA, AND I LIVE UP IN

03:13:05.774 --> 03:13:08.243
DUNLAP. I JUST WANT TO SAY

03:13:08.310 --> 03:13:09.177
THANK YOU FOR THE TIME HERE. I

03:13:09.244 --> 03:13:11.579
WENT TO SCHOOL UP IN DUNLAP,

03:13:11.646 --> 03:13:13.114
WHICH IS ABOUT 90% WHITE, AND I

03:13:13.181 --> 03:13:14.916
WAS ONE OF THE ONLY FEW NATIVE

03:13:14.983 --> 03:13:16.918
KIDS UP THERE IN THAT SCHOOL. I

03:13:16.985 --> 03:13:17.919
WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH WAS

03:13:17.986 --> 03:13:19.955
ABOUT 80% HISPANIC, AND THEN

03:13:20.021 --> 03:13:21.089
OTHER ETHNICITIES. ONLY FOUR OF

03:13:21.156 --> 03:13:23.058
US THERE WHO ARE NATIVE. AND I

03:13:23.124 --> 03:13:25.060
WENT AND GOT MY DEGREE FROM UC

03:13:25.126 --> 03:13:26.561
DAVIS, AND I GOT MY MASTERS

03:13:26.628 --> 03:13:28.730
FROM UC BERKELEY, AND I WORK AT

03:13:28.797 --> 03:13:29.831
FRESNO AMERICAN HEALTH PROJECT

03:13:29.898 --> 03:13:31.099
AS A HEALTH PROMOTION MANAGER.

03:13:31.166 --> 03:13:32.834
AND I SAY ALL THAT TO SAY THIS,

03:13:32.901 --> 03:13:34.970
THAT I AM NOT INDIVIDUALLY MADE,

03:13:35.036 --> 03:13:36.271
I AM COMMUNITY MADE. THERE'S NO

03:13:36.338 --> 03:13:37.939
WAY I WOULD HAVE GOT THROUGH

03:13:38.006 --> 03:13:40.008
ALL THAT AND DONE ANY OF THAT

03:13:40.075 --> 03:13:40.775
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT FROM MY

03:13:40.842 --> 03:13:42.110
COMMUNITY AND MY FAMILY AND

03:13:42.177 --> 03:13:43.945
PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE ME. MY

03:13:44.012 --> 03:13:45.680
DAD, HE CUT WOOD ALL THE WAY UP

03:13:45.747 --> 03:13:46.982
TILL HE WAS 55 YEARS OLD. MY

03:13:47.048 --> 03:13:49.351
MOM WAS A NURSE AND SO ALL I

03:13:49.417 --> 03:13:50.952
KNOW WAS HARD WORK ETHIC. BUT I

03:13:51.019 --> 03:13:51.987
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S VERY

03:13:52.053 --> 03:13:53.221
DIFFICULT TO MOVE THROUGH THESE

03:13:53.288 --> 03:13:54.689
SYSTEMS AND THESE SYSTEMS. I

03:13:54.756 --> 03:13:55.790
SPEAK ABOUT THE EDUCATIONAL

03:13:55.857 --> 03:13:57.125
SYSTEMS AS A NATIVE STUDENT, AS

03:13:57.192 --> 03:13:59.761
A NATIVE PERSON, AND TRYING TO

03:13:59.828 --> 03:14:01.496
BELONG THERE. I HEARD THESE

03:14:01.563 --> 03:14:02.097
WORDS EQUITY, INCLUSION,

03:14:02.163 --> 03:14:03.765
BELONGING AND SAFETY. AND

03:14:03.832 --> 03:14:05.000
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE IN

03:14:05.066 --> 03:14:07.002
THESE SYSTEMS, IN THESE SCHOOLS.

03:14:07.068 --> 03:14:08.203
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS THERE AND

03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:09.137
IT'S NOT ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT.

03:14:09.204 --> 03:14:11.072
AND I WANT TO COMMEND BELLA FOR

03:14:11.139 --> 03:14:12.207
SPEAKING UP AGAIN, BECAUSE I

03:14:12.273 --> 03:14:13.975
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SIT IN

03:14:14.042 --> 03:14:16.044
THOSE ROOMS AND BE TALKED DOWN

03:14:16.111 --> 03:14:17.145
TO BY NON-NATIVE PEOPLE WHO

03:14:17.212 --> 03:14:17.946
DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR WAYS OR

03:14:18.013 --> 03:14:19.080
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WERE

03:14:19.147 --> 03:14:21.082
LATE TO SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU HAD

03:14:21.149 --> 03:14:21.950
TO, YOU KNOW, DEAL WITH THE

03:14:22.017 --> 03:14:24.152
INEBRIATED PARENT OR DON'T KNOW

03:14:24.219 --> 03:14:25.153
WHY. YOU DON'T HAVE CERTAIN

03:14:25.220 --> 03:14:25.920
THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE.

03:14:25.987 --> 03:14:27.889
SO I APPRECIATE, YOU KNOW, THE

03:14:27.956 --> 03:14:29.124
COURAGE AND COMMEND THAT WITH

03:14:29.190 --> 03:14:30.025
BELLA AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO'VE

03:14:30.091 --> 03:14:31.993
DONE IT BEFORE HER. I JUST WANT

03:14:32.060 --> 03:14:33.895
TO SAY, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I

03:14:33.962 --> 03:14:34.796
KNOW TIME IS IMPORTANT. WHAT

03:14:34.863 --> 03:14:35.897
STOOD OUT TO ME HERE AND

03:14:35.964 --> 03:14:38.066
HOPEFULLY WHAT MAKES A MOVEMENT

03:14:38.133 --> 03:14:39.167
AND PROGRESS IS WITH POLICY.

03:14:39.234 --> 03:14:41.436
I'VE KNOWN POLICY IS IMPORTANT,

03:14:41.503 --> 03:14:42.237
BUT ALSO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

03:14:42.303 --> 03:14:44.272
THAT POLICY AND WHERE WE YOU

03:14:44.339 --> 03:14:47.042
KNOW HOW CHAIRMAN SCHEINER SAID,

03:14:47.108 --> 03:14:48.643
YOU KNOW THE WORD, HE USED THE

03:14:48.710 --> 03:14:49.778
BELT, BUT I'M GONNA USE

03:14:49.844 --> 03:14:51.312
ACCOUNTABILITY. SO WHERE WE CAN

03:14:51.379 --> 03:14:52.480
HOLD THESE PEOPLE, THESE

03:14:52.547 --> 03:14:53.548
EDUCATORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR

03:14:53.615 --> 03:14:56.051
ACTIONS BECAUSE IT'S VERY IT'S

03:14:56.117 --> 03:14:57.719
THERE'S THERE'S GOING TO BE A

03:14:57.786 --> 03:14:59.054
LOT TO PUT ON THESE YOUNG

03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:00.955
NATIVE PEOPLE, FOR THEM TO

03:15:01.022 --> 03:15:02.157
EDUCATE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED

03:15:02.223 --> 03:15:02.891
TO EDUCATE THEM AT THESE

03:15:02.957 --> 03:15:03.892
INSTITUTIONS. IT'S NOT THEIR

03:15:03.958 --> 03:15:06.594
JOB TO DO THAT. SO HOPEFULLY

03:15:06.661 --> 03:15:07.095
WITHIN THESE POLICIES,

03:15:07.162 --> 03:15:07.896
IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE, WE CAN

03:15:07.962 --> 03:15:10.465
HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THEIR

03:15:10.532 --> 03:15:11.900
EDUCATIONAL LEVEL TEACH THEM

03:15:11.966 --> 03:15:14.402
AND HELP THEM WITH, YOU KNOW,

03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:15.804
THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY THAT'S

03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:17.739
NEEDED IN THESE INSTITUTIONS.

03:15:17.806 --> 03:15:20.308
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

THANK YOU FOR THIS RARE

03:15:47.168 --> 03:15:49.304
OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS

03:15:49.370 --> 03:15:50.939
PEOPLE WITHIN THE STATE

03:15:51.005 --> 03:15:52.740
GOVERNMENT THAT CAN MAKE A

03:15:52.807 --> 03:15:54.943
DIFFERENCE. AND I ALSO WANT TO

03:15:55.009 --> 03:15:56.478
THANK THE PANELS HERE FOR

03:15:56.544 --> 03:15:57.946
SPEAKING, BECAUSE I THINK THAT

03:15:58.012 --> 03:15:59.948
THE STORIES HERE ARE SO

03:16:00.014 --> 03:16:02.917
IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR

03:16:02.984 --> 03:16:06.888
CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE. I AM

03:16:06.955 --> 03:16:12.527
CHANCEY, AND I AM HERE TO SAY

03:16:12.594 --> 03:16:14.729
THAT THERE IS A HUGE POPULATION

03:16:14.796 --> 03:16:16.831
OF CALIFORNIA INDIANS WITHIN

03:16:16.898 --> 03:16:18.666
CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDE NOT

03:16:18.733 --> 03:16:21.336
ONLY THE UNRECOGNIZED TRIBES,

03:16:21.402 --> 03:16:22.637
BUT THOSE DISENROLLED FROM

03:16:22.704 --> 03:16:26.608
THEIR TRIBES AS WELL, WHICH I

03:16:26.674 --> 03:16:30.278
AM DISENROLLED. I THINK THAT I

03:16:30.345 --> 03:16:31.813
AM HERE TO ASK YOU AND NOT

03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:34.282
REALLY ASK YOU, BUT IMPLORE YOU

03:16:34.349 --> 03:16:37.185
TO TAKE A BROADER SCOPE OF THE

03:16:37.252 --> 03:16:40.321
PICTURE OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN

03:16:40.388 --> 03:16:43.925
PEOPLE IN IN OUR STATE, BECAUSE

03:16:43.992 --> 03:16:46.327
THERE ARE MANY THAT HAVE NO

03:16:46.394 --> 03:16:48.129
REPRESENTATIONS FROM FEDERALLY

03:16:48.196 --> 03:16:50.632
RECOGNIZED TRIBES THAT HAVE

03:16:50.698 --> 03:16:56.171
BEEN. LEFT OUT OF THE

03:16:56.237 --> 03:16:59.340
CONVERSATION. AND THIS GOES FOR

03:16:59.407 --> 03:17:01.943
MANY, MANY PEOPLE HERE IN

03:17:02.010 --> 03:17:04.245
CALIFORNIA. I AM ALSO AN

03:17:04.312 --> 03:17:06.347
EDUCATOR. I WORK FOR THE STATE

03:17:06.414 --> 03:17:07.182
OF CALIFORNIA AS A TEACHER IN

03:17:07.248 --> 03:17:08.583
DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL

03:17:08.650 --> 03:17:10.018
SERVICES FOR 35 YEARS. I'M

03:17:10.084 --> 03:17:12.887
RETIRED, AND I'M ALSO ALTHOUGH

03:17:12.954 --> 03:17:16.090
I'M NOT HERE IN THAT CAPACITY.

03:17:16.157 --> 03:17:18.059
I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE

03:17:18.126 --> 03:17:18.793
CALIFORNIA TRUTH AND HEALING

03:17:18.860 --> 03:17:20.061
COUNCIL ON THE STATUS AND

03:17:20.128 --> 03:17:22.063
IDENTITY COMMITTEE, WHICH WE

03:17:22.130 --> 03:17:22.864
ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO SUBMIT

03:17:22.931 --> 03:17:25.767
A REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR'S

03:17:25.833 --> 03:17:28.836
OFFICE ON THE BROADER STATUS

03:17:28.903 --> 03:17:30.104
AND IDENTITY ISSUES THAT PEOPLE

03:17:30.171 --> 03:17:32.907
HAVE IN OUR STATE. AND I'D LIKE

03:17:32.974 --> 03:17:35.109
TO I THINK K THROUGH 12

03:17:35.176 --> 03:17:36.511
EDUCATION HAS BEEN COVERED

03:17:36.578 --> 03:17:39.681
REALLY WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO.

03:17:39.747 --> 03:17:43.618
SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

03:17:43.685 --> 03:17:45.920
COLLEGE AGE KIDS AND THE FUTURE

03:17:45.987 --> 03:17:48.189
OF OUR KIDS, BECAUSE THE STATE

03:17:48.256 --> 03:17:49.624
OF CALIFORNIA DOES PROVIDE

03:17:49.691 --> 03:17:53.628
SCHOLARSHIP MONIES TO FEDERALLY

03:17:53.695 --> 03:17:56.297
RECOGNIZED TRIBAL MEMBERS.

03:17:56.364 --> 03:17:58.099
HOWEVER, PEOPLE FROM

03:17:58.166 --> 03:17:59.033
UNRECOGNIZED TRIBES OR PEOPLE

03:17:59.100 --> 03:18:01.936
THAT ARE DISENROLLED ARE AT A

03:18:02.003 --> 03:18:03.771
UNIQUE DISADVANTAGE AND NOT

03:18:03.838 --> 03:18:06.407
BEING COVERED WITH THOSE TRIBAL

03:18:06.474 --> 03:18:09.210
SCHOLARSHIPS. I THINK IT'S A

03:18:09.277 --> 03:18:12.080
BIG CREDIT TO GRATON FOR HAVING

03:18:12.146 --> 03:18:13.948
PROVIDED A NEW PROGRAM WHERE

03:18:14.015 --> 03:18:17.819
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET

03:18:17.885 --> 03:18:19.120
SCHOLARSHIPS, EVEN THOUGH THEY

03:18:19.187 --> 03:18:21.222
ARE NOT FROM FEDERALLY

03:18:21.289 --> 03:18:23.324
RECOGNIZED TRIBES OR ARE

03:18:23.391 --> 03:18:25.326
DISENROLLED. HOWEVER, I THINK

03:18:25.393 --> 03:18:26.828
THAT'S REALLY AN OBLIGATION OF

03:18:26.894 --> 03:18:28.463
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

03:18:28.529 --> 03:18:29.564
PROVIDE THOSE SCHOLARSHIPS TO

03:18:29.631 --> 03:18:30.999
ALL CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE.

03:18:31.065 --> 03:18:33.101
AND I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND

03:18:33.167 --> 03:18:38.506
THE ELDER THAT SPOKE. IN REGARD

03:18:38.573 --> 03:18:40.008
TO, YOU KNOW, HER CONCERNS,

03:18:40.074 --> 03:18:42.377
BECAUSE THOSE ARE CONCERNS OF

03:18:42.443 --> 03:18:43.811
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA

03:18:43.878 --> 03:18:45.913
INDIANS THAT DO NOT COME FROM

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:46.848
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES OR

03:18:46.914 --> 03:18:49.017
ARE DISENROLLED. SO I'M ASKING

03:18:49.083 --> 03:18:51.019
YOU AND REALLY IMPLORING YOU

03:18:51.085 --> 03:18:54.222
TODAY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE

03:18:54.289 --> 03:18:56.457
ISSUES AND REALLY PROVIDE TRUTH

03:18:56.524 --> 03:18:58.826
AND HEALING FOR ALL CALIFORNIA

03:18:58.893 --> 03:19:01.429
INDIAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE WE ARE A

03:19:01.496 --> 03:19:04.265
VERY BROAD CATEGORY, AND WE

03:19:04.332 --> 03:19:07.101
HAVE SUFFERED THE SAME HORRIFIC

03:19:07.168 --> 03:19:10.038
TREATMENT AND SUFFER FROM

03:19:10.104 --> 03:19:13.341
GENERATIONAL TRAUMA, AND WE ALL

03:19:13.408 --> 03:19:16.878
DESERVE TO HAVE AN EQUAL

03:19:16.944 --> 03:19:18.846
EDUCATION. SO I REALLY I REALLY

03:19:18.913 --> 03:19:20.882
AM THANKFUL FOR YOU FOR BEING

03:19:20.948 --> 03:19:23.818
HERE TODAY AND HAVE A GOOD DAY.

03:19:23.885 --> 03:19:26.487
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.

03:19:26.554 --> 03:19:31.025
THANK YOU. HI. ASHLEY ROJAS,

03:19:31.092 --> 03:19:32.760
POLICY DIRECTOR WITH INDIGENOUS

03:19:32.827 --> 03:19:34.996
JUSTICE. AND I'LL BE AS BRIEF

03:19:35.063 --> 03:19:37.198
AS I CAN BE TO YOUR QUESTION

03:19:37.265 --> 03:19:37.765
EARLIER TODAY AROUND POLICY

03:19:37.832 --> 03:19:39.934
SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS SCHOOL

03:19:40.001 --> 03:19:42.203
CULTURE AND CLIMATE, THERE ARE

03:19:42.270 --> 03:19:43.871
A NUMBER OF EXISTING MECHANISMS

03:19:43.938 --> 03:19:45.073
AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE

03:19:45.139 --> 03:19:46.741
THOSE MECHANISMS. AND WE DON'T

03:19:46.808 --> 03:19:47.975
TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE LIKE

03:19:48.042 --> 03:19:50.011
EDUCATION IS IN ONE LINE. AND,

03:19:50.078 --> 03:19:51.846
YOU KNOW, OUR MIP CRISIS IS IN

03:19:51.913 --> 03:19:53.047
ANOTHER LINE AND MASS

03:19:53.114 --> 03:19:53.815
INCARCERATION IS IN ANOTHER

03:19:53.881 --> 03:19:55.783
LINE. BUT THIS IS A FULL CIRCLE.

03:19:55.850 --> 03:19:57.385
AND WHEN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

03:19:57.452 --> 03:19:58.686
NOT SAFE AND SUPPORTED AND SEEN

03:19:58.753 --> 03:19:59.821
AND CELEBRATED IN SCHOOL

03:19:59.887 --> 03:20:00.988
SYSTEMS, IT MAKES THEM MORE

03:20:01.055 --> 03:20:02.957
VULNERABLE TO SUBSTANCE USE AND

03:20:03.024 --> 03:20:03.958
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND

03:20:04.025 --> 03:20:05.760
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND TO BE

03:20:05.827 --> 03:20:07.762
PUT ON THAT PATHWAY TO BOTH

03:20:07.829 --> 03:20:09.297
BEING MIP AS WELL AS BEING

03:20:09.364 --> 03:20:11.232
INCARCERATED. SO GRAVES ARE

03:20:11.299 --> 03:20:13.368
CAGES WHEN WE DON'T KEEP OUR

03:20:13.434 --> 03:20:14.869
KIDS WELL AND OUR COMMUNITIES.

03:20:14.936 --> 03:20:17.071
AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:20:17.138 --> 03:20:17.872
THESE SOLUTIONS, THERE'S

03:20:17.939 --> 03:20:19.040
SOMETHING CALLED THE CALIFORNIA

03:20:19.107 --> 03:20:20.942
YOUTH MIRANDA LAW THAT MANDATES

03:20:21.008 --> 03:20:23.244
THAT MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 17

03:20:23.311 --> 03:20:24.312
HAVE AN INTERVENTION AT POINT

03:20:24.379 --> 03:20:26.013
OF CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:27.982
TO PROVIDE THEM THE RESOURCES

03:20:28.049 --> 03:20:30.318
AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO

03:20:30.385 --> 03:20:33.121
NOT FURTHER, YOU KNOW, SELF

03:20:33.187 --> 03:20:33.855
CRIMINALIZE OR FACE ANY

03:20:33.921 --> 03:20:35.056
UNNECESSARY CONSEQUENCES. AND

03:20:35.123 --> 03:20:36.791
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED

03:20:36.858 --> 03:20:38.526
FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

03:20:38.593 --> 03:20:39.727
CLIMATES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES,

03:20:39.794 --> 03:20:41.796
IT'S ABOUT CULTURES AND

03:20:41.863 --> 03:20:42.930
CLIMATES THAT ARE AFFIRMING OF

03:20:42.997 --> 03:20:44.232
WHO STUDENTS ARE, WHICH A LOT

03:20:44.298 --> 03:20:45.933
OF FOLKS HAVE SPOKE TO THE NEED

03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:47.969
FOR BELONGING. BUT WE ALSO HAVE

03:20:48.035 --> 03:20:49.237
TO HAVE PATHWAYS FOR RECOVERY

03:20:49.303 --> 03:20:51.973
AND SUPPORT THAT ARE CULTURALLY

03:20:52.039 --> 03:20:53.241
RESPONSIVE. AND SO THIS MEANS

03:20:53.307 --> 03:20:54.776
THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED

03:20:54.842 --> 03:20:57.178
TO HAVE BETTER TRIBAL

03:20:57.245 --> 03:20:57.712
CONSULTATION, MORE TRIBAL

03:20:57.779 --> 03:20:58.846
REPRESENTATION ON CAMPUS. SO

03:20:58.913 --> 03:21:00.782
OUR STUDENTS ARE OFFERED A

03:21:00.848 --> 03:21:03.017
CULTURAL INTERVENTIONS AND NOT

03:21:03.084 --> 03:21:03.951
JUST LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. THERE

03:21:04.018 --> 03:21:06.421
ARE LOTS OF RIGHTS THAT YOUNG

03:21:06.487 --> 03:21:06.988
PEOPLE HAVE IN THE STATE OF

03:21:07.054 --> 03:21:08.856
CALIFORNIA, BUT THERE ARE NOT A

03:21:08.923 --> 03:21:10.091
LOT OF MECHANISMS TO ENSURE

03:21:10.158 --> 03:21:11.359
THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

03:21:11.426 --> 03:21:13.194
TAUGHT THEIR RIGHTS. AND TRIBAL

03:21:13.261 --> 03:21:13.895
YOUTH IN PARTICULAR, FROM

03:21:13.961 --> 03:21:15.496
UNDRIP TO FEDERAL TO STATE TO

03:21:15.563 --> 03:21:16.931
ED CODE, HAVE A NUMBER OF

03:21:16.998 --> 03:21:18.132
ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS. AND

03:21:18.199 --> 03:21:20.134
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME PROCESS

03:21:20.201 --> 03:21:20.868
WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

03:21:20.935 --> 03:21:22.670
ACCOUNTABLE TO INFORMING YOUNG

03:21:22.737 --> 03:21:23.805
PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES ABOUT

03:21:23.871 --> 03:21:25.239
THE RIGHTS THAT THEIR STUDENTS

03:21:25.306 --> 03:21:27.475
HAVE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY

03:21:27.542 --> 03:21:28.676
WANDER THROUGH THESE SCHOOLS

03:21:28.743 --> 03:21:30.278
HAVING THEIR RIGHTS VIOLATED

HAVE THEM EDUCATE ME ON A

03:24:48.876 --> 03:24:51.712
SITUATION WHERE MY DAD'S GOING

03:24:51.779 --> 03:24:53.814
TO TEACH ME HOW TO BE ANGRY AND

03:24:53.881 --> 03:24:55.082

A LOT OF STUFF THAT HAPPENED TO

03:25:09.063 --> 03:25:09.930
OUR PEOPLE. MY MOM WAS ALWAYS

03:25:11.966 --> 03:25:13.134
AN EDUCATOR AS WELL WITH THE

03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:15.002
EARLY EDUCATION CENTER AS WELL

03:25:15.069 --> 03:25:16.337
AS BEING A TRIBAL LEADER. AS I

03:25:16.404 --> 03:25:17.938

SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS BIG

03:25:26.113 --> 03:25:27.982
WORLD THAT WAS GROWING AROUND

03:25:28.049 --> 03:25:29.750

03:25:29.817 --> 03:25:30.951
RESPECT THAT WE FELT LIKE WE

03:25:31.018 --> 03:25:34.388
DESERVED AS NATIVE PEOPLE.

03:25:34.455 --> 03:25:36.691
BECAUSE WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE

03:25:36.757 --> 03:25:37.958
TAKING CARE AND WE WERE BEING

03:25:38.025 --> 03:25:40.261
STEWARDS OF THIS LAND AND

03:25:40.327 --> 03:25:41.162
TAKING CARE OF OUR PEOPLE, YOU

DIDN'T HAVE DIRTY RIVERS, WE

03:25:44.098 --> 03:25:45.766
DIDN'T HAVE DIRTY AIR, WE

03:25:45.833 --> 03:25:48.636
DIDN'T HAVE PRISONS, WE DIDN'T

03:25:48.703 --> 03:25:51.005
HAVE HOMELESSNESS. ALL THAT

03:25:51.072 --> 03:25:54.308
STUFF THAT YOU SEE TODAY, YOU

03:25:54.375 --> 03:25:55.342
KNOW, AS WE SIT HERE STATING

03:25:55.409 --> 03:25:56.977
THAT WE'RE THE GREATEST COUNTRY

03:25:57.044 --> 03:25:59.447
IN THE WORLD, BUT YET WE STILL

03:25:59.513 --> 03:26:00.815
HAVE ALL THESE ISSUES HAPPENING.

03:26:00.881 --> 03:26:03.184
YOU KNOW, WHEN I, WHEN I TEACH

03:26:03.250 --> 03:26:06.020

03:26:06.087 --> 03:26:08.723
SCHOOL, GET A HIGHER EDUCATION.

03:26:08.789 --> 03:26:10.057
NOW I'M ASKING THEM TO POSSIBLY

03:26:10.124 --> 03:26:12.226
GO TO A SCHOOL THAT ARE HOUSING

03:26:12.293 --> 03:26:15.362
SOME OF OUR ANCESTORS, AND THEY

03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:17.298
DON'T EVEN WANT TO GIVE OUR

03:26:17.364 --> 03:26:19.200
ANCESTORS BACK OR SEND THEM

03:26:19.266 --> 03:26:20.935
BACK ON THEIR JOURNEY WHERE

03:26:21.001 --> 03:26:23.838
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW,

03:26:23.904 --> 03:26:28.109
WE'RE ASKING OUR KIDS TO GO

03:26:28.175 --> 03:26:29.977
LEARN FROM PEOPLE THAT DON'T

03:26:30.044 --> 03:26:33.180
BELIEVE PROTECTING THAT RIVER

03:26:33.247 --> 03:26:34.281
IS OF ANY IMPORTANCE, OR

03:26:34.348 --> 03:26:36.751
PROTECTING THAT AIR, OR

03:26:36.817 --> 03:26:39.320
PROTECTING LIFE IN GENERAL,

03:26:39.386 --> 03:26:40.688
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE

03:26:40.755 --> 03:26:42.022
ALWAYS AFTER THAT BIG ALMIGHTY

03:26:42.089 --> 03:26:43.924
DOLLAR, AND WE FORGET ABOUT

03:26:43.991 --> 03:26:45.226
LIFE AND US AS TRIBAL PEOPLE.

03:26:45.292 --> 03:26:47.294
WE KNOW THAT LIFE IS IS

03:26:47.361 --> 03:26:49.263
EVERYTHING. OUR FAMILY, OUR

03:26:49.330 --> 03:26:50.431
COMMUNITIES ARE EVERYTHING. ONE

03:26:50.498 --> 03:26:51.866
OF THE HARDEST THINGS FOR US TO

03:26:51.932 --> 03:26:54.502
DO AS NATIVE PEOPLE IS GET OFF

03:26:54.568 --> 03:26:55.836
THE RESERVATION, AWAY FROM OUR

03:26:55.903 --> 03:26:57.905
FAMILY, AWAY FROM OUR COMFORT,

03:26:57.972 --> 03:26:59.073
AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THAT WE

03:26:59.140 --> 03:27:00.741
KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE

03:27:00.808 --> 03:27:03.511
TO PROTECT US. AND WE GOT TO

03:27:03.577 --> 03:27:05.012
TRUST THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WE

03:27:05.079 --> 03:27:07.081
GO OUT AND TRY TO GET EDUCATED.

03:27:07.148 --> 03:27:09.049
EDUCATED FROM IS GOING TO TEACH

03:27:09.116 --> 03:27:10.818
US WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW SO WE

03:27:10.885 --> 03:27:12.686
CAN COME BACK AND HELP OUR

03:27:12.753 --> 03:27:13.687
PEOPLE. BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS

03:27:13.754 --> 03:27:15.055
THE CASE. SO FOR US AS NATIVE

03:27:15.122 --> 03:27:17.057
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT AT

03:27:17.124 --> 03:27:19.126
STATE LEADERS LIKE YOURSELVES,

03:27:19.193 --> 03:27:20.628
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MUCH

03:27:20.694 --> 03:27:22.062

03:27:22.129 --> 03:27:24.865
CONSISTENTLY THAT LIKE YOU GUYS

03:27:24.932 --> 03:27:26.167

03:27:28.869 --> 03:27:30.805
DOESN'T A LOT OF THINGS DON'T

03:27:30.871 --> 03:27:31.739
LIKE TO GET TALKED ABOUT UP AT

03:27:31.806 --> 03:27:33.908
THE CAPITOL, BECAUSE IT RAISES

03:27:33.974 --> 03:27:36.744
A LOT OF ISSUES, AND PEOPLE'S

03:27:36.811 --> 03:27:38.946
BODIES MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY

03:27:39.013 --> 03:27:40.347
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE

03:27:40.414 --> 03:27:42.983
BEING RAISED. AND I SAY THAT

03:27:43.050 --> 03:27:44.819
BECAUSE IT'S WATER IS THE BIG

03:27:44.885 --> 03:27:45.986
ISSUE. WATER IS ONE OF THOSE

03:27:46.053 --> 03:27:48.389
THINGS THAT YOU KNOW IT. YOU

03:27:48.455 --> 03:27:49.957
KNOW, OUR STATE LEADERS DON'T

03:27:50.024 --> 03:27:51.959
LIKE TO REALLY DISCUSS IT, OR

03:27:52.026 --> 03:27:53.160
THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET

03:27:53.227 --> 03:27:54.795
INTO THE WEEDS OF WHY WE'RE

03:27:54.862 --> 03:27:55.963
HAVING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:57.865
WE'RE HAVING. SUBSIDENCE,

OVERAPPROPRIATED RIVERS, YOU

03:28:06.340 --> 03:28:07.174
KNOW, EVERYBODY WANTED

03:28:07.241 --> 03:28:08.242
EVERYBODY WANTS THEIR

03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:09.910
ALLOCATIONS TILL IT'S TIME FOR

03:28:09.977 --> 03:28:11.812
A FLOOD YEAR. NOW EVERYBODY

03:28:11.879 --> 03:28:12.947
DON'T WANT IT. OH NO, DON'T

03:28:13.013 --> 03:28:14.915
FLOOD MY LAND. KNOW THAT THAT

ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

03:28:20.788 --> 03:28:21.989
AND. AND WE DON'T EVEN LIKE TO

03:28:22.056 --> 03:28:23.958
SAY FLOODING BECAUSE IT WAS A

03:28:24.024 --> 03:28:24.792
NATURAL OCCURRENCE THAT NEEDED

03:28:24.859 --> 03:28:26.327
TO HAPPEN TO CLEANSE, CLEANSE

03:28:26.393 --> 03:28:29.196

03:28:34.869 --> 03:28:36.103

03:28:55.356 --> 03:28:57.057
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WE'RE

03:28:57.124 --> 03:28:57.925
JUST TRYING TO BE GOOD

03:28:57.992 --> 03:28:59.126
AMERICANS TODAY AND NOT TRYING

03:28:59.193 --> 03:29:01.161

03:29:01.228 --> 03:29:02.863
ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IS

03:29:02.930 --> 03:29:05.065
BEING PUSHED UPON US. BE GOOD

MOVE AWAY FROM THE VALLEY

03:29:57.918 --> 03:29:59.420
BECAUSE THE VALLEY'S AIR WAS

03:29:59.486 --> 03:30:00.988
TOO BAD FOR HER. SHE COULDN'T

03:30:01.055 --> 03:30:03.891
