CA.GOV. TODAY'S HEARING IS GOING

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.000
TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:04.301
THE TYPICAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:05.903
COMMITTEE HEARINGS, SO I WANT TO

00:45:05.969 --> 00:45:08.038
SET THE STAGE FOR WHAT TO

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:10.107
EXPECT. THE COMMITTEE IS HEARING

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:12.409
TWO MEASURES TODAY ACA EIGHT

AB 604 RELATED TO PROPOSED

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:34.965
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. I

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.100
EXPECT THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.501
BEGIN BY DISCUSSING AND VOTING

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:40.003

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:50.180
ROOM, OR WHO ARE WATCHING THIS

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:51.181
HEARING ONLINE. THE ORDER IN

00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:52.983
WHICH THE COMMITTEE HEARS THE

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.485

00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:55.586
THE AVAILABILITY OF THE BILL.

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.254
AUTHORS TO COME PRESENT IN THE

00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:59.089
COMMITTEE. IF THE COMMITTEE

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:03.093
HEARS AB 604 BEFORE SB 280 FOR

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:03.760
PROCEDURAL REASONS, THE

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:05.329
COMMITTEE WILL BE RECESSING THE

THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON AB

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.635

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:18.775
OCCURS, I WILL MAKE AN

00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:20.644
APPROPRIATE ANNOUNCEMENT AT THAT

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:23.180
TIME. WHEN WE HEAR THE BILLS ON

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:24.548
THE AGENDA, INCLUDING THE

INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON AB 604,

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.185
WE WILL HEAR FROM A MAXIMUM OF

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:30.020

DESIGNATED BY THE AUTHOR TO

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:43.300
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:44.701
FOR PUBLIC INPUT. WE WILL ALLOW

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:46.904
OTHER WITNESSES TO SPEAK FOR NO

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.506

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:50.841
TO PREVENT AS MANY PEOPLE AS

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:52.676
POSSIBLE TO TESTIFY. I WILL

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.745
ENFORCE THAT TIME LIMIT

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:58.415
STRICTLY. MY 27 YEARS AS SANTA

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.651
CRUZ COUNTY'S CHIEF ELECTIONS

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:02.085
OFFICIAL IS WHAT I CARRIED INTO

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:03.921
THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:05.756
MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING. AND

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:07.824
LET ME BE CLEAR WHAT WE ARE

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:08.992
BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA IS THE

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:11.461
MOST TRANSPARENT PROCESS IN THE

00:47:11.528 --> 00:47:13.197
NATION. FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:14.631
LAUNCHED A PUBLIC REDISTRICTING

00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:16.500
COMMENT PORTAL RIGHT ON THE

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:17.901
COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE SO VOTERS

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.970
CAN SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THIS

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:21.805
PROCESS. SINCE WEDNESDAY, IT'S

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:24.007
RECEIVED MORE THAN 16,000

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:25.475
SUBMISSIONS. MADAM CHAIR, WE

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:28.111
AREN'T ASKING CALIFORNIANS TO

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:30.047
BASED ON THAT INFORMATION, I,

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:31.148
THE VICE CHAIR, WOULDN'T

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:32.082
INTERRUPT THE CHAIR WHILE SHE'S

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.750
SPEAKING. IT'S RELEVANT TO WHAT

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.018
SHE'S SAYING. IT WOULD BE NICE

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:36.720
IF THE VICE CHAIR WOULD LET THE

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:38.522
CHAIR FINISH HER COMMENTS. MAY I

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:39.957
FINISH MY COMMENTS AND BE ABLE

00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:41.592
TO MAKE MY MOTION? YES. MAY I

00:47:41.658 --> 00:47:42.993
FINISH MY COMMENTS? THANK YOU.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:43.827
WE AREN'T ASKING CALIFORNIANS TO

00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:45.596
RUBBERSTAMP MAPS DRAWN BEHIND

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:46.697
CLOSED DOORS. WE'RE PUTTING THE

00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:48.832
MAPS FRONT AND CENTER AND GIVING

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.401
VOTERS THE FINAL SAY. THIS IS

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:53.136
NOT ABOUT CHERRY PICKING. WHEN

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:54.972
WE FOLLOW OUR INDEPENDENT

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:57.074
REDISTRICTING PROCESS. AS A

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.609
FORMER ELECTIONS OFFICIAL, I

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:00.777
WOULD NEVER STAND FOR THAT. IT

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:02.813
WOULD GO COUNTER TO MY CORE

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:05.349
VALUES AND MY LIFE'S WORK. THIS

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:07.851
IS ABOUT DEFENDING DEMOCRACY

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:09.820
ITSELF, MAKING SURE THE CHECKS

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.922
AND BALANCES ARE KIDS LEARNING.

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.757
GOVERNMENT CLERKS ARE ALIVE AND

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:17.227
WELL. AFTER THE 2026 ELECTIONS.

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:19.463
LET'S BE HONEST, DONALD TRUMP

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:21.465
LIT THIS FIRE WHEN HE PRESSURED

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:22.933
TEXAS TO CHANGE THE RULES

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.202
MID-GAME. CALIFORNIA IS

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:27.704
ANSWERING THAT ATTACK NOT BY

00:48:27.771 --> 00:48:29.873
BREAKING DEMOCRACY, BUT BY

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.109
PROTECTING IT. THE BILLS WE ARE

00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:34.011
HEARING TODAY ONLY TAKE EFFECT

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:36.413
IF ANOTHER STATE RIGS THE

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.949
ELECTION MAPS. CALIFORNIA

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:40.617
BELIEVES AN INDEPENDENT

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:42.119
REDISTRICTING. WE WANT EVERY

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:44.221
STATE TO ADOPT IT, AND OUR

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:45.389
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:47.190
COMMISSION RETAINS ITS AUTHORITY

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:49.126
TO DRAW LINES TO DRAW THE MAPS

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:52.429
IN 2020 AND BEYOND. I UNDERSTAND

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:54.798
THIS IS A FAST PROCESS, BUT WE

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:57.301
ARE FOCUSING ON TRANSPARENCY AND

00:48:57.367 --> 00:48:59.102
ENSURING VOTERS HAVE THE FINAL

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:01.171
SAY ON WHETHER TO ENACT

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:03.006
TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:05.108
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. OUR

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:07.377
DEMOCRACY IS UNDER ATTACK, AND

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:08.845
WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:10.314
ABILITY TO DELAY ACTIONS THROUGH

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.682
OUR COUNTY ELECTIONS. OFFICIALS

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:14.217
CAN ADMINISTER A SECURE,

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.886
TRANSPARENT, ACCURATE AND

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:18.188
ACCESSIBLE ELECTION BECAUSE AT

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:20.924
THE END OF THE DAY, THIS ISN'T

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.459
ABOUT PARTIZANSHIP. IT'S ABOUT

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:25.262
PRINCIPLE, IT'S ABOUT TRUST, AND

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:26.797
IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE EVERY

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:29.333
VOTER KNOWS THEIR VOICE STILL

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:32.669
MATTERS. IN AMERICA, WE WILL

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:34.137
SEEK TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:35.772
ALL WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:37.174
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SO THAT WE

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.975
CAN HAVE EFFECTIVE DELIBERATION

00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:41.111
AND DECISIONS ON CRITICAL ISSUES

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:44.114
FACING CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:46.583
FACILITATE THE COMMITTEE'S

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.017
BUSINESS AND PUBLIC

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:49.453
PARTICIPATION IN TODAY'S

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:54.091
HEARING, WE. WE WILL NOT PERMIT

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:55.926
CONDUCT THAT DISRUPTS, DISTURBS,

OR OTHERWISE IMPEDES THE ORDERLY

00:49:58.528 --> 00:49:59.863
CONDUCT OF LEGISLATIVE

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.065
PROCEEDINGS. VIOLATIONS OF THESE

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.734
RULES MAY SUBJECT YOU TO REMOVAL

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.703

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.271
BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE AGENDA,

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:09.473
I HAVE AN ADDITIONAL

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.219
COMMITTEE'S AGENDA. AND, MADAM

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:23.420
VICE CHAIR, YOU HAD A COMMENT?

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:25.856
YES. I AM MOTIONING AS YOU SAID,

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.491
16,000 COMMENTS WERE SUBMITTED.

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:28.892
I HAVE NOT SEEN THOSE COMMENTS.

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:30.994
I'M NOT SURE IF OTHER MEMBERS OF

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:31.628
THE COMMITTEE HAVE SEEN THOSE

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:33.730
COMMENTS, BUT THOSE WOULD BE

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.065
PERTINENT TO THE DISCUSSION

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:35.732

00:50:42.272 --> 00:50:59.256
THOSE COMMENTS. SECOND.

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:14.037
SO THE COMMENTS ARE PART OF THE

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.974

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.488
MAKE NO MISTAKE, I'M NOT HAPPY

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:20.156
TO BE HERE. ONE OF THE REASONS

00:54:20.223 --> 00:54:21.591
WAS ALLUDED TO, WHICH I'M A NEW

BE HANGING OUT WITH HIM AND HIS

MOM. BUT ACA AND ITS COMPANION

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.003
BILLS ARE THE CULMINATION OF A

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.804
FIGHT THAT WE DON'T WANT, AND

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:36.239
IT'S A FIGHT THAT WE DIDN'T

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:38.041
CHOOSE. BUT WITH OUR DEMOCRACY

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:39.876
ON THE LINE, WE CANNOT RUN AWAY

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:42.379
FROM THIS FIGHT. ACA EIGHT IS

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.480
BEFORE YOU TODAY BECAUSE

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:44.681
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:46.149
IN TEXAS AND OTHER STATES ACROSS

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:47.817
THE COUNTRY ARE ATTEMPTING TO

00:54:47.884 --> 00:54:50.687
REDRAW CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:51.888
MID-DECADE IN AN EFFORT TO RIG

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.457
THE UPCOMING ELECTION. AMERICANS

00:54:54.524 --> 00:54:56.393
AND CALIFORNIANS DESERVE BETTER.

00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:58.862
AND ACA IS OUR RESPONSE TO THIS

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:00.296
UNDEMOCRATIC AND UN-AMERICAN

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:03.233
POWER GRAB KNOWN AS THE ELECTION

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:04.701
RIGGING RESPONSE ACT, ACA EIGHT

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:06.302
WOULD ALLOW FOR THE TEMPORARY

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:09.372

APPROVED CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

BOUNDARIES CONTAINED IN AB 604.

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:16.246
FIRST AND FOREMOST, CALIFORNIA

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.714
VOTERS WILL HAVE THE FINAL SAY

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:18.982
ON WHETHER OR NOT THESE NEW

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:21.484
DISTRICT BOUNDARIES GET USED OR

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:22.919
NOT. SHOULD ACA EIGHT AND ITS

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:25.188

ELECTION ON NOVEMBER 4TH, 2025.

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:31.661
BECAUSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA,

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:33.063
UNLIKE IN TEXAS AND OTHER

00:55:33.129 --> 00:55:35.665
REPUBLICAN LED STATES, WE

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:39.035
RESPECT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS.

00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:40.603
SECOND, THESE MAPS WOULD BE USED

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:41.705
THROUGH THE 2030 CONGRESSIONAL

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:44.974
TERM IF AND ONLY IF TEXAS OR

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:47.177
ANOTHER STATE ENACTS A PARTIZAN

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:47.911
GERRYMANDER OF ITS OWN

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:49.112
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS BEFORE

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.481
THE 2030 CENSUS. THIS TRIGGER

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:54.350
PROVISION IS CAREFULLY CRAFTED

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.553
TO ENSURE THAT A MIDDAY THAT A

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:57.487
MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:59.355
REQUIRED BY FEDERAL COURT ORDER

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:01.591
DOES NOT RESULT IN CALIFORNIA

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:03.393
CHANGING THE MAPS. IT IS ABOUT

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.228
THE PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERING THAT

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:06.696
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DEMANDED OF

00:56:06.763 --> 00:56:11.701
HIS PARTY AFTER THE 2030 CENSUS.

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:12.669
AC EIGHT RETURNS ALL

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:13.770
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT LINE

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:14.938
DRAWING POWERS BACK TO THE

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.306
CITIZEN REDISTRICTING

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.174
COMMISSION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:19.976
NOTE THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:21.344
PACKAGE IMPACTS THE ROLE OF THE

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:22.746
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:23.913

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:26.883
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.819
BOUNDARIES. THIRD AC EIGHT CALLS

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:32.155
ON CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.990
AND PROPOSE A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:36.059
AMENDMENT TO THE US CONSTITUTION

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:38.595
TO REQUIRE THE USE OF FAIR,

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:40.430
INDEPENDENT AND NONPARTIZAN

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:42.298
REDISTRICTING NATIONWIDE. I CALL

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:44.033

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.168
CLAUSE. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.803
FROM YOU. IF YOU SUPPORT

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.403
POLITICAL GERRYMANDERING IN

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.671
REPUBLICAN STATES, BUT NOT

00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:51.174
DEMOCRAT STATES, AND VICE VERSA.

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.976
WE BELIEVE IN NONPARTISAN

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.778
REDISTRICTING FOR CALIFORNIA AND

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.780
FOR EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY.

00:56:56.846 --> 00:56:59.182
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT ACR

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.350
EIGHT SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE TO

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:02.352
OTHER STATES THAT THEY CANNOT

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:04.487
PLAY BY DIFFERENT RULES WHEN IT

00:57:04.554 --> 00:57:05.588
COMES TO REDISTRICTING, AND IT

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:08.124
UPHOLDS CALIFORNIA'S VALUES BY

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:09.225
NEUTRALIZING PARTIZAN

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:10.794
GERRYMANDERING BY OTHER STATES,

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.596
ALL WHILE GIVING CALIFORNIA

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:15.498
VOTERS THE FINAL SAY ON THE

GOING TO SORT OF READ A LETTER

OUT OF 16,000. IT IS WITH GREAT

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.168
RELUCTANCE BUT FIRM RESOLVE THAT

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.937
I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE

EXTRAORDINARY MEASURE OF

REDRAWING OUR CONGRESSIONAL

00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:03.580
DISTRICT MAPS IN MID-DECADE

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:05.081
RATHER THAN HISTORICALLY

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.951
ESTABLISHED NATIONAL NORM OF

00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:08.785
REALIGNMENT FOLLOWING THE CENSUS

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.854

THE COUNTRY FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:16.826
DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:17.727
REPRESENTATION. PART OF THE

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.195
GREAT DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT THAT

REVOLUTIONARY AT THE TIME, I

00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:23.800
MIGHT ADD. UNFORTUNATELY, THESE

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.568
ARE NOT NORMAL TIMES, AND THIS

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:28.037
ISN'T POLITICS AS USUAL. NOT

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:38.114
DAMAGING OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.949

PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:55.765
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.166

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.354
ON EVERY PUBLIC INSTITUTION WE

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:32.855

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:34.390
MONTHS THAT HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE,

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.793
HE HAS WORKED TO FREEZE FUNDS

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:37.427
FOR CRITICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS,

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:38.895

FOR MILLIONS OF OUR STUDENTS AND

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:45.168

DESTROY PUBLIC EDUCATION

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.175
ENTIRELY. THERE'S ALSO BEEN

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:53.276
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS TO OUR

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.378
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND OUR

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.647
LGBTQIA+ STUDENTS AND FAMILIES.

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:59.048
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.550
REMOVAL OF SCHOOLS AS SAFE ZONES

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:01.984
FROM ICE HAS UNLEASHED A LEVEL

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.686
OF TRAUMA AND FEAR THAT NO ONE

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.188
SHOULD EVER ENDURE, LET ALONE

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.323

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:10.927
DETAINED BY FEDERAL AGENTS RIGHT

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.328

STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER. THEY

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:14.597
DESERVE TO FEEL SAFE AND

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:15.531
SUPPORTED AT SCHOOL. THEY

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:17.100
DESERVE EVERY TOOL THEY REPORTED

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.868
TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SET UP

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.303
FOR SUCCESS IN LIFE. AND A

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.304
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS ARE NOT

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.839
WITH HIM ON THESE VICIOUS

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.207

IN STATES WHERE THEY HOLD POWER,

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:34.083
SO THAT HE CAN STACK THE DECK TO

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.418
CONTINUE TO HARM OUR STUDENTS.

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.385

SCHOOLS AND OUR HEALTHCARE. WHEN

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.778
THE LAWMAKERS WENT BACK TO DC,

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:04.013
THEY PROVED THAT THEY'D RATHER

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.148
TAKE ORDERS FROM TRUMP, EVEN IF

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:06.816
IT WAS AT THE EXPENSE OF

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OR

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:43.239
RESOLUTION. JUST GIVE ME A

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:47.576
SECOND SO WE CAN ANSWER YOUR

01:05:47.643 --> 01:06:03.859
QUESTION HERE.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.995
SO THESE ARE NOT AUTHOR'S

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.096
AMENDMENTS. SO THE RULE YOU

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:09.265
CITED IS NOT RELEVANT. A MEMBER

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:15.705
DOES NOT SAY THE AUTHOR. BUT

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.640
THEY ARE NOT AUTHOR'S

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:35.524
AMENDMENTS. ONCE AGAIN IT'S.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:42.698
THE COMMITTEE. RULES ARE CLEAR

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:44.900
THAT THIS IS RELATED TO AUTHOR'S

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:47.770
AMENDMENTS ONLY THESE ARE NOT

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.405
BEING OFFERED BY THE AUTHOR OF

01:06:49.472 --> 01:07:00.049
THE ACA. MADAM. MADAM CHAIR. THE

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:02.551
AUTHOR IS RIVAS AND MCGUIRE. IN

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:05.388
SECTION TWO. IT'S THAT WE

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:08.290
AUTHORED THIS. WE PREPARED THIS

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:10.493

THOROUGHLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.788
MY RULING IS THE AMENDMENTS ARE

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.823
NOT IN ORDER. THERE IS A MOTION

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:48.664
ON THE TABLE. AND YOUR MOTION IS

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.499
NOT IN ORDER AS WELL. MADAM

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:54.270

WHAT GROUNDS, MADAM CHAIR? MY

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:05.147
DECISION. SO THERE'S

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:18.961
TRANSPARENCY AND BIPARTISANSHIP.

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.463
YES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S WOULD LIKE

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.565

MEMBER STEPHANIE. I MOVE TO LAY

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.415
THE AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE. SO

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:47.883
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW US TO

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.051
DEBATE OR PRESENT THESE

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:49.818
AMENDMENTS FOR ANYBODY TO READ.

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:51.720
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO VOTE ON

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.889
THEM. CORRECT. WE ARE GOING TO

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:54.924

NONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE GOING

TO READ THIS BEFORE THEY VOTE ON

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.829
IT. CORRECT. I JUST WANT TO

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:02.631
CLARIFY. IT IS SO. I'M GOOD,

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:03.766
MADAM CHAIR. WE JUST COULD MAKE

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:05.534
THEM BETTER. WE JUST HEARD. I

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:07.036
DON'T THINK THEY WILL. WE JUST

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:08.804
HEARD TESTIMONY FROM THE AUTHOR.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:09.805
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD ALL THE

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.206

ASKING IS FOR OUR INPUT TO BE

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.639
TAKEN. YOU DIDN'T TALK TO ME AS

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:44.773
YOUR VICE CHAIR ABOUT THIS. SO

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.442
HERE'S OUR OPPORTUNITY, MADAM

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:48.277
CHAIR. ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.079
PARTICIPATION IN THIS. AND MR.

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:51.513
TAGHIPOUR CAME PREPARED. THE

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.748
RULES STATE THIS, THAT I WOULD

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:54.583
BE HAPPY TO BRING THE CHIEF

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:56.518
CLERK IN TO REVIEW THIS. I DON'T

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.620
KNOW WHY YOU'RE SHUTTING THIS

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:59.388
DOWN, MADAM CHAIR. I WOULD HAVE

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:00.055
PRESENTED THIS TO YOU SOMETIME

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:02.091
SOONER. AT ANY OTHER TIME. I HAD

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:03.792
NO TIME. WE DIDN'T RECEIVE THIS.

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:04.727
AND YET THERE ARE AUTHORS ON

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:06.895
THIS BEFORE I EVEN GOT TO SEE

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:09.098
THIS. I DIDN'T GET THIS UNTIL

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:10.566
LAST NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE NOT

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:12.334
INFORMED. SO MY QUESTION IS,

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:13.836
SINCE EVERYBODY IS PREPARED,

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.237
SINCE YOU'RE SO FINE WITH THE

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.139
ACA, IS HOW MUCH TIME DID THEY

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:19.708
GET TO PREPARE BEFORE I DID? WHY

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:22.411
AM I NOT DESERVE THAT? SAME FOR

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.046
THE 500,000 REPRESENTATIVES THAT

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.614
I GET TO REPRESENT IN MY

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.982
DISTRICT. WHY AM I NOT GRANTED

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:29.051
THAT SAME RIGHT TO DEFEND THEM?

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.386
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A LONG

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.488
CALIFORNIA THAT THAT MEMBERS GET

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:33.756
72 HOURS BEFORE FINAL VOTE ON

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:37.559
ANY LEGISLATION TO REVIEW THE

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:38.827
LEGISLATION AND THE LANGUAGE OF

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:39.895
THE LEGISLATION BEFORE THEY

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.130
VOTE. BUT THAT LANGUAGE DID YOU

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.998
AS THE FINAL DID YOU HAVE FINAL

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:44.299
VERSION? I SAW THIS LANGUAGE

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:45.801
YESTERDAY. I SAW THIS LANGUAGE

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:48.504
YESTERDAY. YOU SAW THIS. IT WAS

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.204
IN PRINT YESTERDAY MORNING.

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.639
CORRECT. AND THAT'S WHAT I SAW.

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:53.108
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW IT. WHEN

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:54.877
WAS IT WAS IN PRINT. I SAW A

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:55.811
COAUTHOR ON IT IMMEDIATELY.

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:57.813
YEAH. SO YOU HAD SEEN THAT EVEN

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.481
BEFORE IT WAS PRINTED. YOU WERE

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:00.049
ALREADY A COAUTHOR? YEAH. I

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.750
ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE CONCEPT.

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:02.718
I HAD FAITH IN THE AUTHORS TO

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.553
DRAFT THE RIGHT LANGUAGE. THEY

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.888
DID, AND I SUPPORT IT. BUT I DID

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:07.756
NOT HAVE THAT SAME. BUT YOU

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:08.791
DIDN'T EVEN READ. I DID NOT HAVE

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.726
THAT SAME ABILITY. YOU WEREN'T

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:11.960
AWARE OF THE CONCEPT. YOU

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.929
WEREN'T AWARE OF THE NEWS THAT

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:14.730
WE WERE PLANNING ON DOING THAT.

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:17.332
MR. BERMAN EXCUSE ME. WE HAVE WE

SIMPLY JUST ASKING FOR THE SAME

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.937
AMOUNT OF TIME. SO THAT WAY I

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.572
CAN GO INTO THIS JUST AS MUCH AS

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:24.573
EVERYBODY ELSE. I SAW THE

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.208
LANGUAGE. THERE ARE AMENDMENTS

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:27.509
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT, AND I

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:28.844
HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ON

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:29.878
THAT. AND THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:31.480
I'M OKAY. ALL RIGHT. EXCUSE ME.

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:33.782

THIS OUT. IN THE SPIRIT OF

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:42.163
TRANSPARENCY, WE'RE GOING TO GO

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.398
AHEAD AND ALLOW THOSE AMENDMENTS

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.834
TO BE PRESENTED. AND WE'RE GOING

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.136
TO GIVE YOU THREE MINUTES TO DO

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:51.273
SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:52.807
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THAT'S ALL I'M

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:54.809
ASKING FOR IS A FAIR AND EQUAL

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:55.877
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK FOR MY

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.212
REPRESENTATIVES. SO I APPRECIATE

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:00.915
THAT. AND REALLY, AS THE

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:02.083
PRESENTER OF THE BILL, I'D

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:04.619
STATED THAT HE WAS ASSIGNED AS A

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:05.920
COAUTHOR AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:08.256
MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE. I'M

01:22:08.323 --> 01:22:08.790
SORRY. ONE SECOND. CAN WE

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:09.958
DISTRIBUTE THE AMENDMENTS?

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:12.694
SORRY. THANK YOU. WE'LL STOP THE

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:14.729
CLOCK AND START IT AGAIN. THE

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:20.568
SERGEANT. AND. SO, AS WAS STATED

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:21.903
AND NOT ONLY THAT, WE SEE THAT

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:23.638
THERE ARE MULTIPLE COAUTHORS ON

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:26.241
THIS BILL THAT I HOPE DON'T HAVE

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:29.177
THE SAME REGARDS AS THE

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.145
PRESENTER OF THIS STATED THAT

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.713
THEY WERE COAUTHOR BEFORE THEY

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.916
EVEN SAW THIS BILL. I BELIEVE

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:36.251
THAT THESE AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.153
HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:39.487
PROTECTING THE DEMOCRACY IN

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:41.056
WHICH WAS STATED EARLIER TODAY,

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:43.158
THAT WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT THIS

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:44.392
IS AS TRANSPARENT. AND IF YOU'RE

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:45.827
ACTUALLY FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:47.595
OF CALIFORNIA, THAT YOU BUY INTO

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.964
THIS. SO THERE WOULD BE NO

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.066
REASON FOR THEM TO DENY THIS

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.500
AMENDMENT UNLESS THEY HAVE A

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.736
VESTED INTEREST IN THE MAPS THAT

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.037
ARE BEING PRESENTED BEFORE US IN

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.405
THE CHANGES IN THESE

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:58.973
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. SO

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.342
SIMPLY TO READ THE AMENDMENT IS

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.644
A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:03.678
VOTED IN FAVOR OF ASSEMBLY.

ME TO CONSIDER ANY AMENDMENTS

01:25:08.002 --> 01:25:09.304
WHEN THE FIRST MOTION WITHIN

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:10.438
SECONDS OF STARTING THIS MEETING

01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:11.873
WAS TO ADJOURN THIS MEETING. SO

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.575
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR, FOR THE

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:14.809
FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. HOW

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.110
DID YOU PLAN TO SUBMIT THESE

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:18.012
AMENDMENTS IF YOU WERE PLANNING

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:18.847

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:20.782
COUPLE OF SECONDS OF STARTING

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.550
THIS MEETING? WELL, BECAUSE I

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:23.885
SPENT 12 HOURS LAST YEAR READY

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.253
WITH SOME AMENDMENTS. SO HOW

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.554
WERE YOU GOING TO HAVE THIS

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.156
DISCUSSION WHEN YOU WERE MAKING

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:29.958

YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE MAIN

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:35.463
REASON WHY THAT MOTION WAS MADE

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:36.097
IN THE BEGINNING WAS BECAUSE WE

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:38.900
JUST NEED MORE TIME. I DID NOT

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:39.901

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:44.806
THESE BILLS, THEY'VE HAD THE

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:46.274
LANGUAGE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER.

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.475
WE DIDN'T EVEN SET THE COMMITTEE

UNTIL YESTERDAY. SO WE'VE HAD

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:50.945
LESS THAN 24 HOURS TO EVEN KNOW

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:52.714

BE HERE. THAT'S WHY THE MOTION

01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:55.850
TO END THE MEETING WAS THERE

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:57.886
JUST TO GIVE US TIME. SHOULDN'T

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:58.720
WE HAVE MORE THAN 24 HOURS?

01:25:58.786 --> 01:25:59.954

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:19.881
COMMUNITIES. THIS NEW PROPOSED

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.749
MAP WAS DEVELOPED BY LEGISLATORS

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:23.551
AND THEIR CONSULTANTS IN A BACK

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.653
ROOM. THE CRC WAS PROHIBITED

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.522
FROM CONSIDERING PARTIZAN

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:28.990
INTERESTS. THE NEW MAP HAS ONLY

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:32.593
THAT GOAL ADDING SAFE SEATS. CRC

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.862
DRAFT MAPS WERE POSTED FOR 14

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.197
DAYS TO ALLOW FOR THOUGHTFUL

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.199
PUBLIC INPUT. THIS MAP WAS

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:39.133
RELEASED YESTERDAY, YET YOU'RE

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.903
VOTING TODAY. AND WHY ARE YOU

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.704
NOT HEARING FROM GOOD GOVERNMENT

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:44.906
ORGANIZATIONS? BECAUSE IT TAKES

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.541
TIME FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO INFORM

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.443
THEIR MEMBERS, DEBATE, FORMULATE

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.312
AND AGREE UPON A POSITION

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:52.780
STATEMENT. THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.982
LOOKS LIKE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:56.651
MANY BELIEVE WE FACE AN

01:30:56.717 --> 01:30:58.452
EXISTENTIAL THREAT, AND THIS

01:30:58.519 --> 01:30:59.654
LEGISLATION HAS BEEN TOUTED AS

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.656
THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT BACK AND

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:03.491
RESIST AUTHORITARIANISM. BUT

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.760
THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE. THANKS

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:07.562
TO THE CRC, CALIFORNIA HAS SOME

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:08.996
OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:10.398
DISTRICTS IN THE NATION. IN

01:31:10.464 --> 01:31:11.799
FACT, THERE ARE TWICE AS MANY

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.234
DISTRICTS UP FOR GRABS AS

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:14.669
PROPONENTS OF THIS LEGISLATION

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.237
HOPE TO EKE OUT THROUGH

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:17.905
GERRYMANDERING. IT JUST MEANS

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:20.474
THAT PARTIES HAVE TO DO THE WORK

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.243
OF APPEALING FIELDING, APPEALING

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:23.678
CANDIDATES, DEVELOPING A

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:25.213
PLATFORM THAT SPEAKS TO THE

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:26.848
ISSUES VOTERS CARE ABOUT AND

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:28.382
GETTING THEM TO THE POLLS.

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:29.817
THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:31.986
LIKE. DESPITE THE SERIOUS

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:33.421
ATTACKS AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY,

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:35.256
WE CANNOT PRESERVE IT BY

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.291
TORCHING ITS FUNDAMENTAL TENET

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:39.193
THAT VOTERS CHOOSE THEIR

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:39.794
REPRESENTATIVES, NOT THE OTHER

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:42.396
WAY AROUND. AT MINIMUM, RELEASE

01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:44.298
THE DATA AND PROVIDE THE

01:31:44.365 --> 01:31:46.367
RATIONALE FOR YOUR LINES. IF YOU

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:47.935
WANT TO DO A MID-CYCLE

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.971
REDISTRICTING RIGHT, DO IT THE

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:51.305
CALIFORNIA WAY. INSTEAD OF

01:31:51.372 --> 01:31:53.608
SPENDING OVER $200 MILLION ON A

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:56.177
SPECIAL ELECTION FUND, THE CRC

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:57.511
TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC, CREATE

01:31:57.578 --> 01:31:59.347
UPDATED DISTRICTS AND PASS THEM

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:01.983
BY ACROSS PARTIZAN SUPERMAJORITY

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:04.785
VOTE. WE URGE YOU TO SERVE YOUR

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:05.920
CONSTITUENTS BY DEFENDING

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:07.088
CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT PROCESS

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:09.023
AND REJECTING THIS EXPENSIVE AND

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:10.524
MISGUIDED ATTEMPT TO BRING BACK

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.326
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERING. WE

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:14.662
WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. THANK

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:16.597
YOU. NEXT WITNESS THREE MINUTES.

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:18.466
YES. THANK YOU, CHAIR POWELL AND

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:19.800
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:21.535
APOLOGIZE FOR MY BACK BEING TO

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:23.871
SOME OF YOU. MY NAME IS JEAN

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:25.172
RAIA. I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SERVE

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:27.308
ON THE FIRST INDEPENDENT

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.376
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:31.445
STARTING IN 2010. IT WAS

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:33.180
INDEPENDENT, COMPOSED OF A

01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:35.783
DIVERSE POOL, REPRESENTATIVE OF

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:37.418
CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSITY. AND IT

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.686
WAS AN INITIATIVE BROUGHT BY

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:40.388
GOOD GOVERNMENT GROUPS TO PUT

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:42.890
VOTERS FIRST, APPROVING THAT

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.258
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:45.393
EFFECTIVELY ENDED THE BACKROOM

01:32:45.459 --> 01:32:47.228
POLITICAL GERRYMANDERING THAT

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:50.031
HAD CHARACTERIZED REDISTRICTING

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.198
FOR DECADES. WE DREW NEW MAPS

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:53.701
WITH FULL TRANSPARENCY, GIVING

01:32:53.768 --> 01:32:55.569
CITIZENS ACCESS TO THE PROCESS

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:57.605
IN REAL TIME THROUGH PUBLIC

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:59.173
MEETINGS AND THE MEANS TO SUBMIT

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.242
WRITTEN COMMENTS. VOTERS HAD THE

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:02.643
OPPORTUNITY TO DESCRIBE THEIR

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:03.711
COMMUNITIES, THEIR ENVIRONMENT,

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:06.047
THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEIR

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:07.715
ECONOMY SO THEY COULD BE PLACED

01:33:07.782 --> 01:33:09.216
IN A DISTRICT WITH A FAIR CHANCE

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:11.285
OF ELECTING ACCOUNTABLE

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:13.087
REPRESENTATIVES. AND IN FACT,

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:15.256
THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:18.659
TO THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE LAST

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.261
TWO COMMISSIONS, INCLUDING THE

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.862
PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN IN THE

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:24.632
LEGISLATURE, DOUBLED AAPI

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:27.635
REPRESENTATION, TRIPLED, BLACK

01:33:27.702 --> 01:33:29.036
REPRESENTATION NEARLY DOUBLED,

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:32.173
AND LATINOS INCREASED BY 8%. IF

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:34.542
ONLY TEXAS COULD LEARN FROM

01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:35.843
CALIFORNIA THEIR CURRENT

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.712
ATTEMPTS TO RIG THE 2020

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:39.747
ELECTION IN FAVOR OF REPUBLICANS

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:41.315
REPRESENTS THE BASEST

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.717
SELF-INTEREST OF OFFICIALS WHO

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:44.752
ARE SO FEARFUL OF LOSING THEIR

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:46.754
POWER THAT ALL THEY CAN THINK TO

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.856
DO IS CHEAT. THEIR DETERMINATION

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:51.525
TO STACK THE DECK IN THEIR FAVOR

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:53.160
HAS PROMPTED OUR GOVERNOR TO

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:54.895
THREATEN THIS RETALIATORY

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:57.164
MID-CYCLE REDISTRICTING IN AN

01:33:57.231 --> 01:33:59.667
EFFORT TO ELECT MORE DEMOCRATS

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:02.136
BY SIDELINING THE INDEPENDENT

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:03.571
COMMISSION AND HOLDING A SPECIAL

01:34:03.637 --> 01:34:06.107
ELECTION. JUST THIS ONCE. I'M A

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:07.508
REGISTERED DEMOCRAT, ALWAYS HAVE

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:09.677
BEEN, AND I WOULD CELEBRATE

01:34:09.744 --> 01:34:10.745
REPLACING ANY CONGRESSIONAL

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.380
MEMBER WHO HAS FORGOTTEN HIS OR

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:15.016
HER OATH TO REPRESENT THEIR

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.784
CONSTITUENTS AND PROTECT THE

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:18.152
CONSTITUTION. BUT THIS CAN'T BE

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:21.188
AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.356
CONSTITUTION, NOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:25.159
VOTERS WHO MANDATED FAIR,

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:26.660
NONPARTISAN PARTIZAN

01:34:26.727 --> 01:34:28.396
REDISTRICTING. DOES THE THREAT

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:31.265
REALLY CALL FOR RETALIATION? WE

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.401
HAVE WITNESSED ON A DAILY BASIS

01:34:33.467 --> 01:34:35.703
THE CHAOS AND MISTRUST THAT HAS

01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:38.139
COME FROM REVENGE POLITICS IN

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:39.940
WASHINGTON. THAT IS NOT A MODEL

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:42.076
FOR THE RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT

01:34:42.143 --> 01:34:43.844
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE. IT'S NOT A

01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:45.312
MODEL FOR WHICH WE SHOULD SPEND

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:47.448
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A GAMBLE

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.283
THAT DIFFERENT DISTRICTS WOULD

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.385
PRODUCE DIFFERENT RESULTS, OR

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:54.355
THAT WE MIGHT NOT LOSE

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:56.457
INCUMBENTS IN MORE COMPETITIVE

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:57.792
DISTRICTS AND FAIL TO ELECT

01:34:57.858 --> 01:35:00.061
WHATEVER MAGIC NUMBER IS NEEDED

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:02.163
TO WIN THIS ELECTORAL ELECTORAL

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:04.398
WAR AGAINST TEXAS AND WHATEVER

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:06.667
OTHER STATES THE GOVERNOR SAYS

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:08.369
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:10.171
AMERICAN PEOPLE, NEED A FAIR

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:11.539
CHANCE. WE HAVE A FAIR CHANCE

01:35:11.605 --> 01:35:13.674
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:15.176
CHOICE. WE HAVE A VOICE. IT'S

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:17.778
CALLED THE INDEPENDENT

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:19.613
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. THE

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.749
MAPS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED ARE

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:24.185
LIKE A MENU THAT OFFERS YOU

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.986
STEAK. BUT YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN.

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:30.291
SORRY. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE.

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:32.393
CALIFORNIA SET THE GOLD STANDARD

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.828
FOR YOU. WRAP UP PLEASE. YES,

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:36.063
CALIFORNIA SET THE GOLD STANDARD

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.264
FOR REDISTRICTING. THIS IS NOT

01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:40.434
THE TIME TO TAKE A STEP BACK

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.870

ON NOW UNDER SUPERMAJORITY.

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:12.386
CALIFORNIA IS DROWNING IN CRIME.

01:38:12.453 --> 01:38:13.120
WE'RE NOT FUNDING THINGS LIKE

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:16.523
PROPOSITION 36 UNFUNDED. THAT IS

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:18.926
30S. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT WAS

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:23.497

YOU ALL. MY NAME IS NATHANIEL

01:38:30.971 --> 01:38:31.939
NORIEGA. SO THE NINE MOST

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:34.174
TERRIFYING WORDS IN THE ENGLISH

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:35.576
LANGUAGE ARE I'M FROM THE

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:36.777
GOVERNMENT, AND I'M HERE TO HELP

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:38.312
THE CALIFORNIANS. THE CALIFORNIA

01:38:38.379 --> 01:38:39.046
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:40.581
COMMISSION WAS A BIPARTISAN

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:42.049
SUPPORT, SOMETHING THAT IS

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:43.617
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TODAY. AS A

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:45.919
CHECK ON ALL OF YOU POLITICIANS.

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:46.954
THERE'S A REASON WHY THOSE WORDS

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:48.155
WERE SPOKEN BY REAGAN. JUST

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:50.758
BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING IT, WE CAN

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:51.825
DO IT, TOO, IS AN ARGUMENT THAT

01:38:51.892 --> 01:38:53.694
ONLY A CHILD WOULD MAKE. WE'RE

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:54.328
NOT TEXAS. WE'RE CALIFORNIA. WE

01:38:54.395 --> 01:38:55.763
ARE HELD TO A DIFFERENT

01:38:55.829 --> 01:38:57.564
STANDARD. OR AT LEAST WE SHOULD

01:38:57.631 --> 01:38:59.300
BE. IT IS MY FIRST TIME IN OUR

01:38:59.366 --> 01:38:59.933
STATE'S CAPITAL IS BEAUTIFUL,

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.669
BUT WHEN I SEE WHEN I LOOK

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:03.570
OUTSIDE AND SEE SOMEONE SMOKING

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:04.938
30S ON OUR CAPITOL STEPS, THAT

01:39:05.005 --> 01:39:08.442
MAKES ME WONDER. THANK YOU. MY

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:10.210
NAME IS DENISE AGUILAR. I'M

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:11.512

THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ACROSS THE

01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:15.949
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND I'M

01:39:16.016 --> 01:39:17.718
JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHY

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:18.852
THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:20.654
ASSOCIATION IS ONE OF THE MAIN

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:21.588
WITNESSES. AS OUR CHILDREN ARE

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:23.490
GRADUATING ILLITERATE, I THINK

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:24.758
THAT THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

01:39:24.825 --> 01:39:26.960
SHOULD FOCUS ON OUR CHILDREN'S

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:29.129
EDUCATION. THANK YOU AND I

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:32.366
OPPOSE. HI. TARA THORNTON,

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:33.567
CO-FOUNDER, FREEDOM ANGELS. I

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:34.601
ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.003
PREPARED TO SAY. I'M JUST REALLY

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:38.072
SHOCKED WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:39.406
THIS WRONG IS WRONG AND THE

01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:41.241
PEOPLE DON'T WANT THIS. WE WANT

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:42.676
INDEPENDENT. I HAPPEN TO BE FROM

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:44.011
ONE OF THE DISTRICTS THAT WILL

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:46.213
GET DECIMATED WITH ZERO

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.281
REPRESENTATION. BUT EVEN IF I

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:49.350
WASN'T, THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY

01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:50.517
TO GO. AND YOU ACTUALLY DON'T

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:51.952
HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:54.455
ON IT. YOU HAVE A MANDATE TO BE

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:56.323
INDEPENDENT AND TO NOT DO

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:57.658
POLITICAL GERRYMANDERING. I

01:39:57.725 --> 01:40:02.096
OPPOSE. SOFIA KARSTENS

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:04.264

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:05.265
ACTUALLY REDISTRICT WITHOUT

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:06.800
CHANGING THE TEN YEAR RULE

01:40:06.867 --> 01:40:08.302
AROUND THE CENSUS. AND YOU CAN'T

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:09.203
DO THAT WITHOUT AMENDING THE

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:10.304
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION, WHICH

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:12.005
IS VERY ROBUST ON THIS ISSUE.

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:13.841
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT

01:40:13.907 --> 01:40:15.309
REPEALING THE EQUAL PROTECTION

01:40:15.376 --> 01:40:17.044
CLAUSE, WHICH YOU CANNOT DO. ALL

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.612
DUE RESPECT, THE ARGUMENT IS

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:20.280
THAT WE WANT TO PRESERVE

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:22.883
DEMOCRACY. YOU CANNOT PRESERVE

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:24.385

SOLUTION TO THIS SPIRITUAL

02:05:03.729 --> 02:05:05.397
PROBLEM. AND I'VE BEEN PRAYING

02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:06.665
FOR GAVIN NEWSOM SINCE HE WAS

02:05:06.732 --> 02:05:08.734
THE MAYOR. AND I'D ENCOURAGE ALL

02:05:08.801 --> 02:05:11.036

02:05:11.103 --> 02:05:11.937

CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY GREATLY

02:05:30.923 --> 02:05:32.091
UNDERREPRESENTED. WE ONLY HAVE

NINE CONGRESSIONAL SEATS OUT OF

02:05:33.058 --> 02:05:34.727

THIS BILL. MY NAME IS TIMOTHY

JOHNSON FROM FONTANA. THERE IS

02:06:28.113 --> 02:06:30.082
NO WISDOM AND NO UNDERSTANDING

02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:32.584

BACK AND LET THE COMMISSION

02:06:45.230 --> 02:06:46.932
HANDLE ALL THESE THINGS. I

APPRECIATE YOU GUYS TO VOTE NO.

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:53.238

OPPOSE THIS BILL. I DON'T

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:58.243
UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE SO

02:06:58.310 --> 02:07:00.379
INVOLVED THAT WE HAVE TO

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:01.447
REDISTRICT OUR DISTRICTS,

02:07:01.513 --> 02:07:03.315
BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:05.117
HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I

02:07:05.184 --> 02:07:06.018
OPPOSE THIS BILL. I THINK WE

02:07:06.085 --> 02:07:07.653
SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:10.255
REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE

02:07:10.322 --> 02:07:14.059
OF CALIFORNIA. OKAY. SEEING NO

02:07:14.126 --> 02:07:15.894
WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION WILL

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:17.997
BRING IT BACK TO THE DAIS.

02:07:18.063 --> 02:07:19.598
MEMBERS. ANY QUESTIONS?

02:07:19.665 --> 02:07:23.035
COMMENTS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:27.272
BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

02:07:27.339 --> 02:07:31.677
MADAM CHAIR. I APPRECIATE THE

02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:33.379
INDULGENCE. I HAVE NINE POINTS.

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:35.147
I'M GOING TO READ THEM. I'D LIKE

02:07:35.214 --> 02:07:37.282
TO SPEAK THEM ALL, BUT I WANT TO

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:38.584
MAKE SURE I ACTUALLY GET THIS

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:40.519
SAID PROPERLY. AND THE FIRST

02:07:40.586 --> 02:07:42.454
POINT IS, THE FUNDAMENTAL

02:07:42.521 --> 02:07:43.956
QUESTION I THINK IN FRONT OF US

02:07:44.023 --> 02:07:47.192
IS WHO SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OF

02:07:47.259 --> 02:07:50.095
THE POWER? THE VAST POWER OF THE

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:52.464
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR

02:07:52.531 --> 02:07:55.734
FOUNDING FATHERS AGREED ALL

02:07:55.801 --> 02:07:57.503
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO, ON A

02:07:57.569 --> 02:07:59.171
SPECIAL FORM OF DEMOCRACY

02:07:59.238 --> 02:08:02.441
DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR

02:08:02.508 --> 02:08:05.844
DEMOCRACY FROM POWER GRABS. THEY

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:08.914
CREATED THE RULES AND NORMS FOR

02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:11.450
HOW WE COMPETE FOR POWER. THAT'S

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.852
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:15.754
DEMOCRACIES ARE CREATED TO

02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:17.689
SOLVE. WE COULD HAVE IT JUST BE

02:08:17.756 --> 02:08:19.992
MILITARY MIGHT WHOEVER

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:21.360
STRONGEST. THEY GET THE POWER.

02:08:21.427 --> 02:08:24.263
NOT IN THE UNITED STATES. WE

02:08:24.329 --> 02:08:28.267
CREATED THESE RULES AND WE'RE A

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:30.469
RULE OF LAW, NOT MEN. WE HAVE

02:08:30.536 --> 02:08:32.671
CHECKS AND BALANCES. WE HAVE A

02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:35.107
FREE PRESS. AND WE CREATED ALL

02:08:35.174 --> 02:08:37.276
KINDS OF HISTORICAL NORMS THAT

02:08:37.342 --> 02:08:40.179
KEPT US ALL AGREEING. WE WOULD

02:08:40.245 --> 02:08:41.580
FOLLOW THOSE RULES RATHER THAN

02:08:41.647 --> 02:08:44.149
GO TO WAR WITH EACH OTHER OVER

02:08:44.216 --> 02:08:49.121
POWER. DEMOCRACY REQUIRES MANY

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:51.290
OF THESE CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO

02:08:51.356 --> 02:08:53.092
WORK, NOT JUST ONE OF THEM, BUT

02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:54.593
ALL OF THESE CRITICAL COMPONENTS

02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:56.762
NEED TO WORK FOR DEMOCRACY TO

02:08:56.829 --> 02:08:59.665
THRIVE. AUTOCRATS AROUND THE

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:02.501
WORLD TODAY HAVE LEARNED TO GRAB

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:06.205
POWER BY WEAKENING THESE

02:09:06.271 --> 02:09:07.506
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, RULES

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:10.542
AND NORMS, WEAKENING DEMOCRACY

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:12.945
BY ATTACKING AND IGNORING THOSE

02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:15.514
RULES AND NORMS, BY

02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:18.750
INTIMIDATION, BY DECEIT, BY

02:09:18.817 --> 02:09:20.185
MILITARIZATION OF OUR CIVILIAN

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:22.688
LIFE. THOSE ARE ALL WAYS YOU

02:09:22.754 --> 02:09:25.124
WEAKEN THOSE NORMS THAT WE HAVE

02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:28.894
TO HAVE IF WE WANT TO TRANSFER

02:09:28.961 --> 02:09:32.698
POWER PEACEFULLY. AND HERE IN

02:09:32.764 --> 02:09:37.035
THE UNITED STATES, AUTOCRATS

02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:40.806
COUNT ON DEMOCRATIC ADVOCATES TO

02:09:40.873 --> 02:09:43.475
PLAY BY THE OLD RULES WHILE THEY

02:09:43.542 --> 02:09:46.478
GRAB POWER USING THEIR NEW

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:49.548
RULES. AND I WANT TO REPEAT THAT

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:52.618
AUTOCRATS COUNT ON DEMOCRACY

02:09:52.684 --> 02:09:54.286
ADVOCATES TO PLAY BY THE OLD

02:09:54.353 --> 02:09:56.555
RULES WHILE THEY GRAB POWER

02:09:56.622 --> 02:09:59.791
USING THEIR NEW RULES. IT'S A

02:09:59.858 --> 02:10:02.895
FALSE SCENARIO TO SAY WE CAN WIN

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:06.231
SIMPLY BY WORKING HARDER, RIGHT?

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:08.667
WHILE AUTOCRATS GRAB POWER USING

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:11.603
THEIR OLD RULES. A FEW DECADES

02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:15.941
AGO, RUSSIA WAS A DEMOCRACY.

02:10:16.008 --> 02:10:18.510
TODAY, DEMOCRATIC ADVOCATES, NO

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:20.979
MATTER HOW HARD THEY WORK, HAVE

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:24.516
NO CHANCE OF VOTING PUTIN OUT OF

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:28.153
POWER. HE WILL KILL OFF ANY OF

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:31.056
THE STRONGER OPPONENTS THAT HE

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:36.461
HAS. MANY OF US PREFER THE OLD

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:38.597
RULES. WE PREFER THE AGREEMENT

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:41.233
WE ALL HAD TO PLAY BY THOSE

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:44.636
RULES, RIGHT? BUT WHEN AUTOCRATS

02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:47.172
CHANGE THE RULES AND THE NORMS

02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:50.142
THAT WE ARE USING TO DECIDE WHO

02:10:50.209 --> 02:10:54.079
HAS POWER, WE CAN EITHER FIGHT

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:58.050
BACK OR WE CAN POTENTIALLY

02:10:58.116 --> 02:10:59.518
PERMANENTLY LOSE THE ABILITY

02:10:59.585 --> 02:11:03.388
EVER TO FIGHT BACK AGAIN IN THE

02:11:03.455 --> 02:11:04.556
FUTURE. THAT IS THE QUESTION IN

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:06.658
FRONT OF US. IN SPITE OF ALL

02:11:06.725 --> 02:11:08.227
KINDS OF OTHER DISTRACTIONS WE

02:11:08.293 --> 02:11:11.163
WILL HAVE. WHAT ARE THE RULES

02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:13.165
AND NORMS FOR HOW WE TRANSFER

02:11:13.232 --> 02:11:16.134
POWER? THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO

02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:19.004
GRAB CONTROL OF THE POWER OF THE

02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:21.707
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WITH

02:11:21.773 --> 02:11:24.710
REDISTRICTING, AND PERMANENTLY

02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:26.778
POTENTIALLY GRAB THAT CONTROL.

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:29.781
THAT IS TOO BIG OF A RISK FOR US

02:11:29.848 --> 02:11:31.283
TO SAY, WELL, WE LIKE DOING IT

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:35.020
THE OTHER WAY. WE LIKE THE MORE

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:37.522
GET ALONG, EVERYBODY FOLLOW THE

02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:39.424
DEMOCRATIC WAY. WE SIMPLY DON'T

02:11:39.491 --> 02:11:41.693
HAVE THAT CHOICE TODAY. I

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.495
STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. I

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:44.830
APPRECIATE THE SPEAKER'S

02:11:44.896 --> 02:11:46.031
LEADERSHIP. I APPRECIATE THE

02:11:46.098 --> 02:11:48.367
CHAIR'S LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING

02:11:48.433 --> 02:11:50.969
THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY

02:11:51.036 --> 02:12:00.045
MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OKAY. I

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:02.114
HOPE YOU BEAR WITH ME, BECAUSE I

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:03.682
SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:04.950
CATCH UP, TRYING TO READ, TRYING

02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:07.085
TO INFORM MYSELF AS MUCH AS

02:12:07.152 --> 02:12:09.421
POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SO

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:11.189
LITTLE TIME, SO LITTLE TIME,

02:12:11.256 --> 02:12:12.791
THAT EVEN THE PRESENTERS STATED

02:12:12.858 --> 02:12:13.959
THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN READ THE

02:12:14.026 --> 02:12:17.229
BILL. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE

02:12:17.296 --> 02:12:20.399
AUTHORS OR OTHER DON'T HOLD OR

02:12:20.465 --> 02:12:21.967
THE OTHER COAUTHORS ON THIS

02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:24.770
BILL. I HOPE THEY DON'T HOLD THE

02:12:24.836 --> 02:12:27.272
SAME SENTIMENT THAT THE PEOPLE

02:12:27.339 --> 02:12:27.939
OF CALIFORNIA DON'T EVEN DESERVE

02:12:28.006 --> 02:12:32.010
A READ ON A BILL. I HAVE A FEW

02:12:32.077 --> 02:12:34.813
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, ACTUALLY.

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.682
AND FIRST AND FOREMOST, I DO

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.650
WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:40.052
OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. I CAN SAY

02:12:40.118 --> 02:12:42.187
THIS. WHAT WE'VE SEEN TODAY IS I

02:12:42.254 --> 02:12:43.622
KNOW I'M A CONSERVATIVE, I KNOW

02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:45.691
I'M A REPUBLICAN, AND I KNOW

02:12:45.757 --> 02:12:48.093
THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENCES. BUT

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:50.529
THE MAPS THAT BOTH OF YOU WORKED

02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:52.130
ON, ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING

02:12:52.197 --> 02:12:53.298
TO DID GIVE REPRESENTATION. NOW,

02:12:53.365 --> 02:12:55.467
I CAN SAY THAT I DID NOT VOTE ON

02:12:55.534 --> 02:12:59.171
THE FAIR COMMISSION, MAINLY

02:12:59.237 --> 02:13:01.406
BECAUSE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD AT

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:03.675
THE TIME, BUT I RESPECTED IT, I

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:06.278
TRULY RESPECTED IT, AND A LOT OF

02:13:06.345 --> 02:13:06.878
THE WORK AND THE DELIBERATION,

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.847
BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS

02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:11.183
THAT WAS OVERLY OVERLY INTO, YOU

02:13:11.249 --> 02:13:12.651
KNOW, OUR ELECTED LEADERS. AND A

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:14.386
BIG PORTION OF THAT IS BECAUSE I

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:16.221
GREW UP RIGHT DOWN THE STREET

02:13:16.288 --> 02:13:17.789
FROM THE CAPITOL, YOU KNOW, IN

02:13:17.856 --> 02:13:19.424
ONE OF THE POOREST COMMUNITIES

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:20.892
IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF

02:13:20.959 --> 02:13:21.860
CALIFORNIA, AND ACTUALLY ONE OF

02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:24.563
THE ROUGHEST GANG AFFILIATED

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:25.764
COMMUNITIES. AND IT WAS THOSE

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:26.932
GANG MEMBERS THAT ACTUALLY

02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:29.301
PROTECTED ME, PAID FOR ME TO GET

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:29.901
INTO THIS POSITION. AND NOW I

02:13:29.968 --> 02:13:32.571
CAN PROUDLY SAY, AS THE FIRST

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:33.638
POLYNESIAN INDIVIDUAL EVER

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:35.040
ELECTED TO THE STATE OF

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:35.874
CALIFORNIA, YOU KNOW, IT WAS

02:13:35.941 --> 02:13:37.409
DONE BY AN INDEPENDENT

02:13:37.476 --> 02:13:38.276
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION THAT

02:13:38.343 --> 02:13:39.745
ACTUALLY BELIEVED IN THE

02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:41.446
EFFICACY OF WHAT THIS STATE CAN

02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:43.048
BE. AND THERE'S A LOT THAT WE'VE

02:13:43.115 --> 02:13:45.584
HEARD TODAY OF TESTIMONY, YOU

02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:48.587
KNOW, AND WE'VE SEEN A TRUE

02:13:48.653 --> 02:13:49.788
BIPARTISAN COALITION HERE JUST

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:51.523
TRYING TO PROTECT, BECAUSE

02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:53.125
CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEAD THE WAY

02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:54.526
WHEN OTHER STATES DECIDE TO DO

02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:55.927
SOMETHING ELSE, WE SHOULDN'T

02:13:55.994 --> 02:13:57.829
REACT TO THEM. WE SHOULD PROVE

02:13:57.896 --> 02:13:59.831
BY EXAMPLE THAT WE CAN DO THIS

02:13:59.898 --> 02:14:01.199
BETTER, THAT WE CREATE THE

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:02.801
FOUNDATIONS FOR THE REST OF THE

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:04.236
NATION, BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO

02:14:04.302 --> 02:14:06.238
GO. AS CALIFORNIA GOES, THE

02:14:06.304 --> 02:14:08.840
NATION THAT'S WE'VE LOST THAT,

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:10.642
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND

02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:13.111
HEARD TODAY. WE CAN'T EVEN READ

02:14:13.178 --> 02:14:14.646
OUR OWN BILL, BUT WE'LL DECIDE

02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:16.815
TO PRESENT IT AND VOTE ON IT,

02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:17.949
TOO. THAT'S INSANITY. AND THAT'S

02:14:18.016 --> 02:14:19.317
HEARTBREAKING TO THE REST OF

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:20.685
CALIFORNIANS, BECAUSE, AGAIN, I

02:14:20.752 --> 02:14:22.320
WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS WHO JUST

02:14:22.387 --> 02:14:24.322
OBSESSED AT THE POLICY MAKERS IN

02:14:24.389 --> 02:14:25.724
THIS BUILDING, ACTUALLY CARED

02:14:25.791 --> 02:14:27.259
ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:14:27.325 --> 02:14:29.895
BUT HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU ACTUALLY

02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:30.595
CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF

02:14:30.662 --> 02:14:32.597
CALIFORNIA IF YOU DIDN'T EVEN

02:14:32.664 --> 02:14:33.665
READ IT? YOU KNOW, AND THAT

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.200
BREAKS MY HEART BECAUSE I SPEND

02:14:35.267 --> 02:14:37.536
SO MUCH TIME ON THIS, BECAUSE

02:14:37.602 --> 02:14:39.871
I'LL WORK MYSELF TO DEATH

02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:42.774
TRYING, TRYING, TRYING TO MAKE

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:45.377
SURE I DIDN'T ASK A QUESTION,

02:14:45.444 --> 02:14:45.877
BUT I JUST WANTED TO

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:47.512
MISREPRESENTING WHAT I SAID. AND

02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:48.980
YOU'RE DOING IT OVER AND OVER

02:14:49.047 --> 02:14:51.650
AND OVER AGAIN, AND I WILL

02:14:51.716 --> 02:14:52.684
CORRECT THE RECORD WHEN IT'S MY

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:55.020
TIME. I'M JUST LET'S LET THE

02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:58.190
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SPEAK. LET'S GO

02:14:58.256 --> 02:15:00.992
AHEAD. JUST KNOW THAT IS

02:15:01.059 --> 02:15:01.927
ABSOLUTELY MISREPRESENTING WHAT

02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:03.628
I SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WHAT

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:05.764
SHE NEEDS TO DO TO TRY TO

02:15:05.831 --> 02:15:07.399
JUSTIFY HIS POSITION ON THIS

02:15:07.466 --> 02:15:08.300
BILL. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:09.868
YOU STATED THAT YOU SUPPORTED IT

02:15:09.935 --> 02:15:11.536
PRIOR TO SEEING IT. IS THAT NOT

02:15:11.603 --> 02:15:12.938
WHAT YOU SAID VERBATIM? WHAT I

02:15:13.004 --> 02:15:14.673
SAID IS THAT THERE WERE

02:15:14.739 --> 02:15:16.141
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:16.842
THE BILL, AND I ABSOLUTELY

02:15:16.908 --> 02:15:18.109
SUPPORT THOSE CONCEPTS. PRIOR TO

02:15:18.176 --> 02:15:19.778
THE BILL IS FIVE PAGES LONG. I'M

02:15:19.845 --> 02:15:21.646
SORRY IT TOOK YOU SO LONG TO

02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:23.482
READ IT. I'M SORRY THAT AND I

02:15:23.548 --> 02:15:24.816
UNDERSTAND YESTERDAY MORNING WAS

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:26.885
TOO LONG FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO

02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:27.886
READ A FIVE PAGE BILL. THAT'S

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:30.121
ALL RIGHT. BUT WE DISCUSSED AS

02:15:30.188 --> 02:15:31.056
LEGISLATORS, RIGHT? WE DISCUSS

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:31.690
CONCEPTS, WE DISCUSS IDEAS, WE

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:32.924
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE

02:15:32.991 --> 02:15:34.993
GOING TO SUPPORT THINGS. BECAUSE

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:35.760
THIS BILL IS ATTACHED TO SO

02:15:35.827 --> 02:15:36.862
MANY. UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S A

02:15:36.928 --> 02:15:38.663
NEW CONCEPT FOR YOU. THAT'S

02:15:38.730 --> 02:15:39.631
OKAY. BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU TOOK

02:15:39.698 --> 02:15:41.867
36 HOURS TO READ A FIVE PAGE

02:15:41.933 --> 02:15:43.301
BILL. IT DOES, AND IT DOES TAKE

02:15:43.368 --> 02:15:45.003
ME TIME IN THE DEBATE. IT DOES

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:46.872
TAKE ME TIME, BECAUSE I WILL

02:15:46.938 --> 02:15:48.707
TAKE 36 HOURS TO READ A FIVE

02:15:48.773 --> 02:15:49.708
PAGE BILL FOR 40 MILLION PEOPLE

02:15:49.774 --> 02:15:51.476
IN THIS STATE, BECAUSE THEY

02:15:51.543 --> 02:15:52.544
DESERVE IT, BECAUSE THEY DESERVE

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:54.579
IT. IT'S FIVE PAGES, MR. TONGA.

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:55.180
THAT'S OKAY. OKAY, OKAY. WE'RE

02:15:55.247 --> 02:15:56.781
NOT DEBATING THE LENGTH OF THE

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:59.184
TIME IT TAKES TO READ FIVE

02:15:59.251 --> 02:15:59.718
PAGES. LET'S STICK TO THE

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:00.685
SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL, PLEASE.

02:16:00.752 --> 02:16:02.020

SOME OF MY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

02:16:04.756 --> 02:16:06.958
TO THE LAWYER THAT IS HERE. SO

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:07.692
YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH THE BILL,

02:16:07.759 --> 02:16:09.094
RIGHT? YOU HAVE READ THE

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:10.128
LANGUAGE IT PROBABLY TOOK. YOU

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:11.863

02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:14.699
I DID, I ASSUME. CAN I ASK YOU

02:16:14.766 --> 02:16:15.600

WITNESS, WHICH I DON'T

02:16:24.009 --> 02:16:24.910

02:16:31.116 --> 02:16:31.883

QUESTIONS, OR IS THIS GOING TO

02:16:42.794 --> 02:16:44.863
BE DROWN OUT? I JUST WOULD LIKE

02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:46.097
TO, LIKE YOU DID, TO START THE

02:16:46.164 --> 02:16:47.699
HEARING. IT'S KIND OF GOING BACK

02:16:47.766 --> 02:16:48.867
AND FORTH HERE. LET'S HAVE ONE

02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:51.536
PERSON SPEAK AT A TIME. ASSEMBLY

02:16:51.603 --> 02:16:52.771
MEMBER, PLEASE ASK YOUR QUESTION

02:16:52.837 --> 02:16:53.805
TO THE WITNESS. AS LONG AS YOU

02:16:53.872 --> 02:16:55.640
DON'T MAKE VEILED THREATS TO MY

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:56.708

02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:58.410
ALL. OKAY, LET LET'S JUST LET

02:16:58.476 --> 02:17:00.178
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASK HIS

02:17:00.245 --> 02:17:03.748
QUESTION, PLEASE. WELL, WHO IS

02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:06.117
FUNDING THE RETAINER FOR YOU TO

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:08.587
BE HERE? AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU

02:17:08.653 --> 02:17:10.221
SEEN THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL?

02:17:10.288 --> 02:17:12.023
WHEN DID YOU FIRST GET IT AND

02:17:12.090 --> 02:17:13.625
WHEN DID YOU START SEEING IT?

02:17:13.692 --> 02:17:16.094
BECAUSE I DID NOT GET IT UNTIL

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:16.928
YESTERDAY. SO HOW MUCH TIME DID

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:21.433
YOU HAVE TO REVIEW THIS? MR. I

02:17:21.499 --> 02:17:23.602
I'M HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL

02:17:23.668 --> 02:17:25.036
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE BILL

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:26.871
WORKS. I'M NOT I'M NOT HERE TO

02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:29.341
TALK REVEAL ATTORNEY CLIENT

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:31.943
PRIVILEGE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.378
REPRESENTATION I PROVIDE OR

02:17:33.445 --> 02:17:35.280
ANYTHING THAT WENT INTO THE WORK

02:17:35.347 --> 02:17:37.182
PRODUCT. I CAN ASK I CAN ANSWER

02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:38.817
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FACE OF THE

02:17:38.883 --> 02:17:40.385
MEASURE. I JUST FOR ME, SINCE IT

02:17:40.452 --> 02:17:41.953
TAKES ME SO LONG TO READ. I JUST

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:44.589
WANTED TO KNOW HOW LONG YOU HAD

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:45.857
TO READ IT. AND IF YOU, AS A

02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:47.659
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE MERITS OF

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:49.127
THE BILL, LET'S ASK QUESTIONS

02:17:49.194 --> 02:17:49.928
ABOUT MERIT. THIS IS BACK. THIS

02:17:49.995 --> 02:17:51.696
IS NOT HOW LONG IT TAKES

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:53.999
SOMEBODY TO READ A BILL IS NOT.

02:17:54.065 --> 02:17:55.266
WE CONSULT WITH PEOPLE BEFORE WE

02:17:55.333 --> 02:17:56.101
INTRODUCE THOSE BILLS. THIS

02:17:56.167 --> 02:17:57.369
ISN'T A FOREIGN CONCEPT. THIS

02:17:57.435 --> 02:17:58.837
ISN'T A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.

02:17:58.903 --> 02:18:01.006
THIS IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. IF YOU

02:18:01.072 --> 02:18:03.241
HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE MERITS

02:18:03.308 --> 02:18:05.644
OF THE BILL, PLEASE ASK IT.

02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:11.149
OKAY. THEN WE'LL GO INTO EVEN

02:18:11.216 --> 02:18:12.917
MORE OF THE MERITS. SO UNDER THE

02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:15.086
NEW REDISTRICTING PROPOSAL AND A

02:18:15.153 --> 02:18:16.755
LOT OF THESE, IN THE MAIN REASON

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:18.857
WHY I'M ASKING FOR SO MUCH TIME

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:20.258
IS BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS THAT I

02:18:20.325 --> 02:18:21.693
PREPPED YESTERDAY WHEN I SAW

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:22.494
THIS ALL CHANGED BECAUSE THE

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.396
MAPS CHANGED AT 8 P.M. LAST

02:18:24.462 --> 02:18:26.231
NIGHT, AND I THINK THAT IT'S

02:18:26.297 --> 02:18:28.066
WELL WITHIN THE PROCESS TO SAY,

02:18:28.133 --> 02:18:29.901
LIKE, I SHOULD KNOW, THE MAPS

02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:32.170
CHANGED AT 8:00 AT 8 P.M. THE

02:18:32.237 --> 02:18:34.239
MAPS WERE RELEASED ON FRIDAY, I

02:18:34.305 --> 02:18:35.573
BELIEVE, AND THEY HAVE NOT

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:36.841
CHANGED. THEY CHANGED PER THE

02:18:36.908 --> 02:18:38.176
CENSUS TRACK. MADAM CHAIR, THE

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:39.844
FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:41.780
SHOULD CAUSE WORRY TO EVERYBODY.

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:43.448
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. 8 A.M.

02:18:43.515 --> 02:18:44.582
YESTERDAY. SORRY, SORRY. NOT 8

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:46.785
P.M, 8 A.M. 8 P.M. LAST NIGHT

02:18:46.851 --> 02:18:48.386
THERE WAS A CHANGE AT MY

02:18:48.453 --> 02:18:51.423
UNDERSTANDING WAS 8 A.M. BUT I

02:18:51.489 --> 02:18:52.991
AM EAGER TO HEAR REGARDLESS.

02:18:53.058 --> 02:18:54.726
WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION? TO THE

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:56.828
MERIT OF THE BILL. OKAY, WELL,

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.530
THEN CLOVIS WOULD BE SPLIT INTO

02:18:58.596 --> 02:18:59.764
THREE DIFFERENT CONGRESSIONAL

02:18:59.831 --> 02:19:01.666
DISTRICTS. NOT ANYMORE. BECAUSE

02:19:01.733 --> 02:19:03.668
THE LAST CHANGE THAT I GOT AS OF

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:05.904
TWO HOURS AGO ON THE NEW MAPS,

02:19:05.970 --> 02:19:07.539
NOW THEY ARE KEPT INTO ONE

02:19:07.605 --> 02:19:09.307
DISTRICT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE

02:19:09.374 --> 02:19:10.208
RATIONALE FOR SPLITTING UP

02:19:10.275 --> 02:19:12.043
CLOVIS RESIDENTS, THUS WEAKENING

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:13.678
THEIR VOICE? I THINK THAT WOULD

02:19:13.745 --> 02:19:14.746
BE A BETTER QUESTION FOR THE

02:19:14.813 --> 02:19:16.781
AUTHORS OF THE BILL. THAT

02:19:16.848 --> 02:19:17.949
ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:19:18.016 --> 02:19:19.484
MAPS. MY BILL HAS TO DO WITH

02:19:19.551 --> 02:19:21.119
PUTTING THE SPEAKER'S

02:19:21.186 --> 02:19:21.786
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, HAS TO

02:19:21.853 --> 02:19:23.588
DO WITH GIVING VOTERS THE

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:25.490
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR VOICES

02:19:25.557 --> 02:19:26.858
HEARD, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE

02:19:26.925 --> 02:19:28.660
WILL HAVE A SPECIAL ELECTION ON

02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:29.961
NOVEMBER 4TH. SO I AM NOT

02:19:30.028 --> 02:19:31.596
PREPARED TO SPEAK TO THE

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:33.264
SPECIFIC ITERATIONS OF THE MAPS,

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:34.766
BUT I BELIEVE SOMEBODY WILL BE

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:36.868
PRESENTING THAT BILL AFTER THIS

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:38.236
ACA, WHO HOPEFULLY WILL BE

02:19:38.303 --> 02:19:40.438
BETTER PREPARED TO DISCUSS

02:19:40.505 --> 02:19:42.507
INDIVIDUAL LINE DRAWING OF

02:19:42.574 --> 02:19:43.975
COMMUNITIES. WELL, THE MAPS ARE

02:19:44.042 --> 02:19:45.243
PERTINENT TO THIS ACA BECAUSE

02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:47.078
THE ACA IS TO GIVE VOTERS THE

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:49.214
VOICE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:50.682
THEIR VOICES HEARD ON WHETHER OR

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:51.816
NOT THEY WANT TO HAVE A

02:19:51.883 --> 02:19:53.084
MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING. CAN

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:55.153
YOU SPEAK TO THE COST OF THE ACA

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:56.955
AND HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST

02:19:57.021 --> 02:19:58.123
THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA,

02:19:58.189 --> 02:19:59.491
THEN ABOUT THE SAME AS THE

02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:00.825
RECALL, HOW MUCH IS PUT FORWARD?

02:20:00.892 --> 02:20:03.294
HOW MUCH IS THAT? I BELIEVE THAT

02:20:03.361 --> 02:20:05.029
RECALL WAS DONE BY THE CITIZENS

02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:05.964
INITIATIVE. IT WASN'T DONE BY

02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:08.833
THIS BODY. IT FUNDAMENTALLY WAS

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.368
THE ANSWER. THE ANSWER REMAINS

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:11.770
THE SAME, THAT IT'S THE SAME

02:20:11.836 --> 02:20:12.771
COST. YOUR QUESTION WAS WHAT'S

02:20:12.837 --> 02:20:14.606
THE COST? AND I SAID, IT'S THE

02:20:14.672 --> 02:20:17.342
SAME AS THE RECALL. IT DOESN'T

02:20:17.408 --> 02:20:18.343
MATTER. YOU PUT IT ON THE

02:20:18.409 --> 02:20:19.144
BALLOT. THE RECALL SINCE 2021 OR

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:20.912
2021 TO WHERE WE'RE AT NOW,

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:22.147
WE'VE SEEN 40% INFLATION RATES.

02:20:22.213 --> 02:20:24.315
SO IS IT 40% MORE THE TARIFFS

02:20:24.382 --> 02:20:24.949
THAT TRUMP JUST PUT IN EFFECT,

02:20:25.016 --> 02:20:25.984
IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN 40%

02:20:26.050 --> 02:20:28.486
INFLATION RATES. BUT I BELIEVE

02:20:28.553 --> 02:20:31.890
THE COST OF THE OF THE SPECIAL

02:20:31.956 --> 02:20:32.924
APPROXIMATELY 200. THE QUESTION

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:35.026
THAT I ASKED, JUST HOW MUCH DOES

02:20:35.093 --> 02:20:36.528
IT COST? MR. EXCUSE ME. CAN YOU

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:37.629
JUST LET HIM ANSWER THE

02:20:37.695 --> 02:20:42.400
QUESTION? HE'S DOING? SO JUST

02:20:42.467 --> 02:20:43.501
CLOSE YOUR MOUTH, OPEN YOUR

02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:44.035
EARS, LISTEN TO HIM FOR A

02:20:44.102 --> 02:20:45.870
SECOND, PLEASE. HUNDRED MILLION

02:20:45.937 --> 02:20:47.005
DOLLARS. JUST WE GOTTA WE ALL

02:20:47.071 --> 02:20:49.140
NEED TO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER. SO

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:50.375
WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS SPEAKING,

02:20:50.441 --> 02:20:51.342
LET'S HAVE ONE SPEAKER AT A

02:20:51.409 --> 02:20:53.044
TIME. WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE. I'M

02:20:53.111 --> 02:20:54.879
JUST SAYING NO. I'M SAYING IT TO

02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:56.047
BOTH OF YOU. I'M GOING TO SAY

02:20:56.114 --> 02:20:58.216
THAT TO BOTH OF YOU. PLEASE,

02:20:58.283 --> 02:20:58.817
PLEASE REFRAIN FROM SPEAKING

02:20:58.883 --> 02:20:59.751
WHEN THE OTHER PERSON IS

02:20:59.818 --> 02:21:00.785
SPEAKING. THANK YOU, MADAM

02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:03.454
CHAIR. I ASK A QUESTION. CAN YOU

02:21:03.521 --> 02:21:05.523
REPEAT THIS? IS THERE IS THERE A

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:08.126
ACTUAL ACTUAL FISCAL ANALYSIS ON

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:09.961
HOW MUCH THIS WILL COST THE

02:21:10.028 --> 02:21:11.729
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ITS

02:21:11.796 --> 02:21:16.000
CURRENT 2025, 2026 COST, NOT TO

02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:18.303
THE 2021. YOU CAN'T, I THINK THE

02:21:18.369 --> 02:21:19.704
APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. SO

02:21:19.771 --> 02:21:21.406
THIS WILL BE OVER $200 MILLION,

02:21:21.472 --> 02:21:24.976
I THINK SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 200

02:21:25.043 --> 02:21:26.544
AND $250 MILLION. OKAY. AND SO

02:21:26.611 --> 02:21:27.712
WITH A ROLLING AND LOOMING $20

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:29.414
BILLION DEFICIT PREDICTED BY THE

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.516
LAL ALL THE WAY UNTIL 2028, YOU

02:21:31.583 --> 02:21:33.551
BELIEVE THAT IT'S WITHIN THE

02:21:33.618 --> 02:21:34.185
RIGHT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:21:34.252 --> 02:21:36.888
THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY, NOT THE

02:21:36.955 --> 02:21:38.089
PEOPLE WHO PUT IT ON THE

02:21:38.156 --> 02:21:39.824
INITIATIVE. WHEN IT CAME TO THE

02:21:39.891 --> 02:21:40.725
RECALL ELECTION THAT WAS DONE

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:41.960
THROUGH A CITIZENS INITIATIVE.

02:21:42.026 --> 02:21:44.195
NOBODY HERE DID THAT. THIS IS

02:21:44.262 --> 02:21:46.397
BEING DONE BY US, THE

02:21:46.464 --> 02:21:48.233
LEGISLATORS HERE. HANG ON. BY

02:21:48.299 --> 02:21:50.001
ALL MEANS. SO I'LL LET YOU

02:21:50.068 --> 02:21:51.035
PONTIFICATE AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

02:21:51.102 --> 02:21:52.470
YEAH. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:57.108
THAT. IS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT

02:21:57.175 --> 02:22:00.144
THAT 200 AND WE CAN ADJUST COST

02:22:00.211 --> 02:22:02.146
FOR INFLATION? $300 MILLION IS

02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:04.682
WHAT A STATE AND A MASSIVE

02:22:04.749 --> 02:22:05.950
DEFICIT AND A ROLLING DEFICIT

02:22:06.017 --> 02:22:07.819
YEAR OVER YEAR PREDICTED BY THE

02:22:07.886 --> 02:22:10.121
LAO IS WHAT THIS STATE SHOULD BE

02:22:10.188 --> 02:22:12.657
SPENDING MONEY ON. CAN I ANSWER?

02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:14.158
YES, SIR. THANK YOU MISTER.

02:22:14.225 --> 02:22:16.661
THANK YOU SO. ABSOLUTELY. AND

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:18.596
THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE

02:22:18.663 --> 02:22:20.565
THE DAMAGE THAT THIS REPUBLICAN

02:22:20.632 --> 02:22:22.400
CONGRESS HAS DONE TO THE STATE

02:22:22.467 --> 02:22:24.335
OF CALIFORNIA MAKES $250

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:25.570
MILLION. LOOKS LIKE COUCH

02:22:25.637 --> 02:22:27.839
CUSHION CHANGE. MY ONE OF MY

02:22:27.906 --> 02:22:28.773
COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:31.042
SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS GOING TO

02:22:31.109 --> 02:22:33.077
VOTERS TO THE TO THE BALLOT TO

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:35.680
TRY TO RECOUP SOME OF THE OVER

02:22:35.747 --> 02:22:38.082
$1 BILLION, OVER $1 BILLION JUST

02:22:38.149 --> 02:22:40.451
TO THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA, TO

02:22:40.518 --> 02:22:42.453
THEIR HEALTH SYSTEM BECAUSE OF

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:44.355
TRUMP'S BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL AND

02:22:44.422 --> 02:22:46.124
THE DECIMATION THAT THAT IS

02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:48.159
HAVING THAT ALL NINE REPUBLICAN

02:22:48.226 --> 02:22:49.327
MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:22:49.394 --> 02:22:51.095
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION VOTED

02:22:51.162 --> 02:22:53.431
ON LIKE A BUNCH OF FECKLESS

02:22:53.498 --> 02:22:55.066
FOLLOWERS, NO MATTER THE DAMAGE

02:22:55.133 --> 02:22:56.467
THAT IS DOING TO THEIR

02:22:56.534 --> 02:22:57.969
COMMUNITIES, THE BILLIONS OF

02:22:58.036 --> 02:23:00.872
DOLLARS THAT THAT THE REPUBLICAN

02:23:00.939 --> 02:23:03.041
CONGRESS IS TAKING AWAY AND THE

02:23:03.107 --> 02:23:04.876
COST THAT THAT'S HAVING FOR

02:23:04.943 --> 02:23:06.577
CALIFORNIANS AND CALIFORNIA

02:23:06.644 --> 02:23:08.046
TAXPAYERS. AND SO IF THAT'S JUST

02:23:08.112 --> 02:23:09.714
SANTA CLARA COUNTY, 2 MILLION

02:23:09.781 --> 02:23:11.983
PEOPLE AND IT'S OVER $1 BILLION

02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:13.084
HIT THAT THEIR HEALTH CARE

02:23:13.151 --> 02:23:13.985
SYSTEM IS TAKING, THAT THE

02:23:14.052 --> 02:23:15.920
POOREST RESIDENTS OF SANTA CLARA

02:23:15.987 --> 02:23:18.356
COUNTY RELY ON JUST TO GET THEIR

02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:21.059
BASIC HEALTH CARE OVER $1

02:23:21.125 --> 02:23:23.161
BILLION. IMAGINE THE COST THAT

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:24.128
THIS REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IS

02:23:24.195 --> 02:23:25.997
COSTING THE ENTIRE STATE OF

02:23:26.064 --> 02:23:27.131
CALIFORNIA. SO DO I THINK THAT

02:23:27.198 --> 02:23:29.667
WE SHOULD SPEND $200 MILLION FOR

02:23:29.734 --> 02:23:31.436
THE OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID

02:23:31.502 --> 02:23:33.504
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:36.140
REPUBLICAN HITS TO OUR BUDGET? I

02:23:36.207 --> 02:23:37.575
ABSOLUTELY DO, AND I'M CURIOUS

02:23:37.642 --> 02:23:39.477
TO SEE IF VOTERS WILL AGREE WITH

02:23:39.544 --> 02:23:42.180
ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:43.348
BIGGEST THING THAT I'M LOOKING

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:45.416
AT. AND AGAIN, WE'VE HAD VERY,

02:23:45.483 --> 02:23:47.518
VERY LITTLE TIME, VERY LITTLE

02:23:47.585 --> 02:23:49.320
TIME TO THE QUESTION FOR THE

02:23:49.387 --> 02:23:51.689
MEMBERS THAT WERE ON THE

02:23:51.756 --> 02:23:52.991
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

02:23:53.057 --> 02:23:54.459
COMMISSION, HOW MUCH TIME ON

02:23:54.525 --> 02:23:55.059
AVERAGE DID YOU SPEND WHEN IT

02:23:55.126 --> 02:23:57.829
COMES TO DEVELOPING MAPS? WELL,

02:23:57.895 --> 02:24:00.565
WE WERE THE FIRST COMMISSION.

02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:02.367
AND BECAUSE THE VOTERS ACT FOR

02:24:02.433 --> 02:24:04.936
CONGRESS, VOTERS FIRST ACT FOR

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:08.139
CONGRESS PASSED PRETTY LATE. WE

02:24:08.206 --> 02:24:10.041
GOT THE CONGRESSIONAL MAP ALONG

02:24:10.108 --> 02:24:12.844
WITH THE STATE LEGISLATIVE MAPS,

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:14.612
AND THEN WE HAD TO DO IT ONE

02:24:14.679 --> 02:24:16.748
MONTH EARLIER. SO I THINK IN

02:24:16.814 --> 02:24:18.049
TOTAL, WE HAD SEVEN AND A HALF

02:24:18.116 --> 02:24:19.484
MONTHS, SEVEN AND A HALF MONTHS.

02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:20.718
YEAH. WHICH WE WORK PRETTY,

02:24:20.785 --> 02:24:22.553
PRETTY LONG HOURS TO MEET THE

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:23.955
DEADLINES. HOW MANY MEETINGS DO

02:24:24.022 --> 02:24:25.156
YOU THINK YOU CAN ESTIMATE

02:24:25.223 --> 02:24:27.625
AROUND? WE HAD ABOUT 100

02:24:27.692 --> 02:24:29.727
MEETINGS. SOME OF THEM WERE

02:24:29.794 --> 02:24:31.262
DEDICATED PUBLIC INPUT HEARINGS

02:24:31.329 --> 02:24:33.131
AND SOME OF THEM WERE BUSINESS

02:24:33.197 --> 02:24:34.132
MEETINGS. WE ALWAYS HAD PUBLIC

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:35.366
INPUT AVAILABLE AT THOSE

02:24:35.433 --> 02:24:36.934
MEETINGS. THANK YOU. AND HOW

02:24:37.001 --> 02:24:39.170
MANY HOURS DO YOU THINK IT WOULD

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:41.606
BE THE SAME? YEAH, YEAH. THE

02:24:41.672 --> 02:24:43.408
COMMISSION WAS VERY DILIGENT IN

02:24:43.474 --> 02:24:46.377
ALL MEMBERS PARTICIPATING TO THE

02:24:46.444 --> 02:24:48.112
FULLEST. WHAT DO YOU THINK WERE

02:24:48.179 --> 02:24:49.013
SOME OF THE BEST PROTECTIONS

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:50.415
THAT THE INDEPENDENT

02:24:50.481 --> 02:24:52.083
REDISTRICTING, YOU KNOW, REALLY

02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.884
IMPLEMENTED? YOU KNOW, SOME OF

02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:54.252
THE RULES AND STIPULATIONS? CAN

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:55.686
YOU GO OVER THAT? BECAUSE WHEN,

02:24:55.753 --> 02:24:58.122
YOU KNOW, I JUST HAVE VERY, VERY

02:24:58.189 --> 02:25:00.358
LARGE, VERY LARGE WORRIES,

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:02.493
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS ACA, THAT

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:05.430
NOT ONLY DOES IT OPEN US UP FOR

02:25:05.496 --> 02:25:06.798
LITIGATION, JUST SIMPLY IN THE

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.699
WAY THAT IT'S WRITTEN, BUT THAT

02:25:08.766 --> 02:25:10.201
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS. AND

02:25:10.268 --> 02:25:11.636
THEN, YOU KNOW, SOME OF US

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:13.571
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD SPEND

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:14.472
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:16.140
FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL WILL BE

02:25:16.207 --> 02:25:18.242
SUED AND WILL BE CHALLENGED OR

02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:20.745
COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. AND THEN,

02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:23.147
I MEAN, WE DON'T EVEN IT WON'T

02:25:23.214 --> 02:25:25.216
EVEN WORK BY GETTING THIS ONTO

02:25:25.283 --> 02:25:26.951
THE BALLOT. AND THE BIG REASON

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:29.053
WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:31.689
IT STATES HERE THAT

02:25:31.756 --> 02:25:33.124
REDISTRICTING IN ALL THE OTHER

02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:34.058
STATES. SO THERE'S A PORTION OF

02:25:34.125 --> 02:25:35.960
THE BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT THAT,

02:25:36.027 --> 02:25:37.728
THIS WON'T KICK INTO EFFECT

02:25:37.795 --> 02:25:39.030
UNLESS TEXAS, FLORIDA AND ALL

02:25:39.097 --> 02:25:40.398
THE OTHER STATES, YOU KNOW,

02:25:40.465 --> 02:25:43.434
DON'T REDISTRICT UNLESS COURT

02:25:43.501 --> 02:25:44.569
ORDERED, UNLESS COURT ORDERED.

02:25:44.635 --> 02:25:51.242
THAT'S IN THE BILL. THE TEXAS IN

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:54.645
ON THE 7TH OF JULY GOT A DOJ

02:25:54.712 --> 02:25:56.047
NOTICE, STATED THAT THEY HAD A

02:25:56.114 --> 02:25:58.382
THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING

02:25:58.449 --> 02:25:59.917
DIFFERENT. SO IF THEY EVENTUALLY

02:25:59.984 --> 02:26:01.552
GET A COURT ORDER AND WE COME

02:26:01.619 --> 02:26:04.155
BACK TO THIS, WE'RE GOING TO DO

02:26:04.222 --> 02:26:06.057
THIS ACA AND IT'S NOT EVEN GOING

02:26:06.124 --> 02:26:07.759
TO BE ABLE TO BE IMPLEMENTED

02:26:07.825 --> 02:26:08.759
BECAUSE THE RULES AND

02:26:08.826 --> 02:26:10.228
STIPULATIONS UNDER THIS ACA

02:26:10.294 --> 02:26:12.230
CHANGE THAT. SO THE PROTECTIONS

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:13.598
UNDER THE INDEPENDENT

02:26:13.664 --> 02:26:14.198
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION, CAN

02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:16.300
YOU SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THAT?

02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:18.102
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CRC,

02:26:18.169 --> 02:26:20.605
WE TALK ABOUT ITS INDEPENDENCE,

02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:23.808
ITS TRANSPARENCY, AND THE FACT

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:26.077
THAT IT'S COMMUNITY CENTERED. SO

02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:28.579
THE INDEPENDENCE IS THAT IT'S A

02:26:28.646 --> 02:26:31.782
MULTI-PARTISAN COMMISSION

02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:34.752
CONSISTING OF FIVE DEMOCRATS,

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:36.554
FIVE REPUBLICANS AND FOUR

02:26:36.621 --> 02:26:38.723
INDEPENDENTS. AND AS YOU MAY

02:26:38.789 --> 02:26:40.424
HAVE HEARD ME MENTION, WE

02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:42.927
ROTATED THE CHAIR AND THE VICE

02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:45.730
CHAIR SO THAT EVERY MEETING WE

02:26:45.796 --> 02:26:48.266
SWITCHED IT UP SO THAT NO PARTY

02:26:48.332 --> 02:26:52.470
WAS IN CONTROL AT ANY TIME FOR

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:54.038
TRANSPARENCY. EVERYTHING WE DID

02:26:54.105 --> 02:26:57.808
WAS IN THE LIGHT OF DAY. WE DREW

02:26:57.875 --> 02:26:59.944
LINES IN REAL TIME WHEN WE

02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:01.646
COULD, ESPECIALLY DURING THE

02:27:01.712 --> 02:27:04.582
REFINEMENT PERIOD. EVERY MAP

02:27:04.649 --> 02:27:06.684
THAT WE ASKED, WE DIRECTED OUR

02:27:06.751 --> 02:27:08.252
LINE DRAWING CONSULTANTS TO

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:10.388
CREATE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHARED

02:27:10.454 --> 02:27:13.491
WITH THE PUBLIC. PEOPLE WERE

02:27:13.558 --> 02:27:15.893
ALLOWED TO COMMENT AS THESE MAPS

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.828
WERE BEING PRESENTED, AND WE

02:27:17.895 --> 02:27:20.298
WOULD RECEIVE THAT INPUT AND PUT

02:27:20.364 --> 02:27:22.733
IT IN THE PUBLIC INPUT FILE. THE

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:25.203
CURRENT COMMISSION, BY THE WAY,

02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:25.870
HAS A VERY NICE DASHBOARD

02:27:25.937 --> 02:27:26.837
SHOWING ALL OF THE PUBLIC

02:27:26.904 --> 02:27:29.774
COMMENT THEY GOT AND

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:32.243
INTERACTIVE. WISH WE HAD THAT

02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:35.880
TECHNOLOGY BACK IN 2011. AND

02:27:35.947 --> 02:27:39.083
THEN FINALLY THAT IT'S A VERY

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:41.085
COMMUNITY CENTER PROCESS. SO THE

02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:43.454
FACT THAT WE HAD 100 MEETINGS

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:45.623
THAT ANYONE COULD COME AND

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:48.893
TESTIFY OR THEY COULD EMAIL, WE

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:51.429
WERE GETTING, YOU KNOW, TWEETS

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:56.067
AT THE TIME AND, AND, YOU KNOW,

02:27:56.133 --> 02:27:58.569
LETTERS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS, ALL

02:27:58.636 --> 02:28:01.172
KINDS OF DIFFERENT PUBLIC

02:28:01.239 --> 02:28:03.908
TESTIMONY THAT WE ALL WORKED

02:28:03.975 --> 02:28:08.246
REALLY HARD TO READ. WE HAD

02:28:08.312 --> 02:28:11.182
OVER, I THINK, WE 22,000 PUBLIC

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:12.149
COMMENTS IN OUR CYCLE. I THINK

02:28:12.216 --> 02:28:15.519
THE CURRENT COMMISSION HAD ABOUT

02:28:15.586 --> 02:28:16.621
35,000 PUBLIC COMMENTS THANKS TO

02:28:16.687 --> 02:28:20.858
NEW TECHNOLOGY. SO THAT WAS A

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:23.361
VERY CRITICAL PART. WAS THIS

02:28:23.427 --> 02:28:24.228
COLLABORATION AND INTERACTION

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:26.097
WITH THE PUBLIC? YEAH, I SPENT A

02:28:26.163 --> 02:28:28.165
LOT OF TIME JUST LISTENING INTO

02:28:28.232 --> 02:28:29.834
THESE COMMISSIONS, AND I COULD

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:32.837
TELL YOU WHAT I TRULY, TRULY

02:28:32.903 --> 02:28:34.038
THANK YOU FOR THE SACRIFICE THAT

02:28:34.105 --> 02:28:35.973
YOU MADE TO SIT ON THERE

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:37.875
BECAUSE, I MEAN, I DID IT FROM A

02:28:37.942 --> 02:28:39.477
PHONE AND I GOT TO LISTEN

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:41.012
BECAUSE I CARED ABOUT MY

02:28:41.078 --> 02:28:42.280
COMMUNITY. THIS WAS BEFORE ANY

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:43.247
POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS, ANY ANY

02:28:43.314 --> 02:28:44.849
GOALS, JUST JUST TO LISTEN INTO

02:28:44.915 --> 02:28:45.783
THE COMMISSION. AND IT'S

02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:47.852
SOMETHING THAT I CAN SAY AS I

02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:49.287
DREW THE MAPS IN REAL TIME.

02:28:49.353 --> 02:28:50.821
THAT'S A PROCESS, RIGHT? THAT

02:28:50.888 --> 02:28:52.189
THE MAPS HAVE TO BE DRAWN IN

02:28:52.256 --> 02:28:54.158
PUBLIC VIEW, AND YOU CAN SEE THE

02:28:54.225 --> 02:28:55.826
LINES. THAT'S PART OF THE

02:28:55.893 --> 02:28:56.794
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION, RIGHT?

02:28:56.861 --> 02:28:58.663
YEAH. JUST TO BE CLEAR, THE

02:28:58.729 --> 02:29:00.631
INITIAL MAPS, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD

02:29:00.698 --> 02:29:02.833
GIVE DIRECTION IN PUBLIC TO OUR

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:04.902
LINE DRAWING CONSULTANTS BECAUSE

02:29:04.969 --> 02:29:06.637
IT TOOK A LOT OF COMPUTER

02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:07.738
CRUNCHING AND THEY WOULD COME

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:09.407
BACK AND PRESENT THEM TO MAKE

02:29:09.473 --> 02:29:11.242
SURE IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH OUR

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:13.110
DIRECTION. AND THOSE WERE

02:29:13.177 --> 02:29:13.744
AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO VIEW

02:29:13.811 --> 02:29:16.747
AND COMMENT ON. AND WHEN THEY

02:29:16.814 --> 02:29:18.616
WERE OFFICIAL DRAFT MAPS, THEY

02:29:18.683 --> 02:29:20.084
HAD TO BE POSTED FOR 14 DAYS

02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:21.719
WITH NO CHANGES. ONE OF THE

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:23.587
COOLEST THINGS THAT I GOT TO SEE

02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:24.655
IS WHICH COMMUNITIES WOULD COME

02:29:24.722 --> 02:29:27.058
OUT AND THEY'D ALL SAY, KEEP US

02:29:27.124 --> 02:29:28.693
TOGETHER. AND IT JUST TO SEE,

02:29:28.759 --> 02:29:30.061
LIKE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

02:29:30.127 --> 02:29:31.829
REALLY TO JUST SAY LIKE HAVE A

02:29:31.896 --> 02:29:33.664
VESTED INTEREST. I THINK THERE'S

02:29:33.731 --> 02:29:35.466
NO DOUBT THAT WE SUPPORT THE

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:36.400
WORK OF THE INDEPENDENT

02:29:36.467 --> 02:29:37.635
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. BUT IF

02:29:37.702 --> 02:29:38.235
WE CAN BRING THE CONVERSATION

02:29:38.302 --> 02:29:39.870
BACK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL,

02:29:39.937 --> 02:29:42.239
COULD YOU CONTINUE SOME OF THE

02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:42.973
TRANSPARENCY PORTIONS OF THAT

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:45.142
AND HOW THE TRANSPARENT THE

02:29:45.209 --> 02:29:46.210
TRANSPARENCY IS DIFFERENT

02:29:46.277 --> 02:29:48.045
COMPARED TO THE BILL THAT WE'RE

02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:52.717
SEEING TODAY? WELL, SO LIVE MAP

02:29:52.783 --> 02:29:54.118
DRAWING, INTERACTIVE MAP

02:29:54.185 --> 02:29:56.687
DRAWING, WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO

02:29:56.754 --> 02:29:58.389
DISCUSS REDISTRICTING MATTERS

02:29:58.456 --> 02:30:01.659
OUTSIDE OF A PUBLIC MEETING. SO

02:30:01.726 --> 02:30:03.461
COMMISSIONERS WERE BARRED FROM

02:30:03.527 --> 02:30:05.329
DISCUSSING ANYTHING NOT IN

02:30:05.396 --> 02:30:08.099
PUBLIC. AND I'D LIKE TO BRING IN

02:30:08.165 --> 02:30:09.033
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BENNETT. YOU HAVE

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:11.001
A QUESTION? I JUST HAVE A

02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:12.403
QUESTION IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN

02:30:12.470 --> 02:30:14.905
YOU WATCH COMMITTEES AT THE

02:30:14.972 --> 02:30:16.841
NATIONAL LEVEL AND OFTENTIMES

02:30:16.907 --> 02:30:18.075
COMMITTEES HAVE SOME KIND OF

02:30:18.142 --> 02:30:21.178
TIME LIMIT ON EACH MEMBER IN

02:30:21.245 --> 02:30:22.646
TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY

02:30:22.713 --> 02:30:23.981
GET TO TALK OR ELSE, LITERALLY,

02:30:24.048 --> 02:30:25.750
WE COULD KEEP GOING AND ASKING

02:30:25.816 --> 02:30:26.884
MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:27.818
TRANSPARENCY AND MORE QUESTIONS

02:30:27.885 --> 02:30:30.421
ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. I'M JUST

02:30:30.488 --> 02:30:33.023
RAISING THE QUESTION. I WOULD

02:30:33.090 --> 02:30:34.825
PROPOSE THAT THIS THIS ISSUE MAY

02:30:34.892 --> 02:30:36.494
BE ONE OF THOSE ONES WHERE WE

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:37.795
NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF TIME

02:30:37.862 --> 02:30:40.030
LIMIT. I WANT IT TO BE FAIR. I

02:30:40.097 --> 02:30:41.899
WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE. BUT IT

02:30:41.966 --> 02:30:43.367
IS APPROPRIATE FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:45.202
BODIES TO, AT SOME POINT IN

02:30:45.269 --> 02:30:47.371
TIME, IDENTIFY SO A MEMBER CAN

02:30:47.438 --> 02:30:49.340
FOCUS ON THEIR MOST IMPORTANT

02:30:49.407 --> 02:30:50.074
QUESTIONS BEFORE THEIR TIME

02:30:50.141 --> 02:30:52.042
LIMIT IS UP. ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE

02:30:52.109 --> 02:30:53.444
TRYING TO BRING THE CONVERSATION

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:55.479
BACK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL.

02:30:55.546 --> 02:30:56.981
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE HONOR

02:30:57.047 --> 02:30:57.782
AND APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT

02:30:57.848 --> 02:30:59.483
YOU'VE DONE FOR OUR STATE. BUT

02:30:59.550 --> 02:31:00.785
THESE ARE THESE ARE VERY

02:31:00.851 --> 02:31:01.819
UNCERTAIN AND DIFFERENT TIMES

02:31:01.886 --> 02:31:03.521
NOW, AND WE'RE NO LONGER

02:31:03.587 --> 02:31:05.389
GOVERNING IN A DEMOCRACY. SO WE

02:31:05.456 --> 02:31:07.057
ARE HAVING TO MOVE QUICKLY IN

02:31:07.124 --> 02:31:08.526
ORDER TO MEET THE TIMELINES OF

02:31:08.592 --> 02:31:11.095
DOING THIS WORK AND GIVING THE

02:31:11.162 --> 02:31:14.098
VOTERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON

02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:15.232
WHETHER THEY SUPPORT THESE MAPS

02:31:15.299 --> 02:31:17.134
OR NOT. DOES ANY OTHER MEMBER

02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:18.636
HAVE A QUESTION ON THE CONTENT

02:31:18.702 --> 02:31:19.837
OF THE BILL? MADAM CHAIR, I'M

02:31:19.904 --> 02:31:21.939
NOT I'M NOT DONE YET. OKAY, SO I

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:23.841
KNOW WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

02:31:23.908 --> 02:31:25.609
THE MERITS OF THE BILL? YEAH,

02:31:25.676 --> 02:31:26.744
YEAH, IT'S MAINLY I'M JUST

02:31:26.811 --> 02:31:27.745
TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT THE

02:31:27.812 --> 02:31:28.379
TRANSPARENCY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:30.514
THE ACA AND THAT. SO AND I THINK

02:31:30.581 --> 02:31:32.283
LET'S FOCUS ON THE MERITS OF

02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:33.551
THIS BILL ON WHAT'S BEING

02:31:33.617 --> 02:31:35.986
PROPOSED TODAY. IS IT IS IT

02:31:36.053 --> 02:31:37.154
COMPARISON TO THE CURRENT

02:31:37.221 --> 02:31:38.589
ITERATION OF WHAT WE DO NOW TO

02:31:38.656 --> 02:31:40.758
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO, NOT TO

02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:42.126
THE MERITS OF THIS BILL? IS THAT

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:43.627
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? I THINK

02:31:43.694 --> 02:31:44.895
YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT ON THAT.

02:31:44.962 --> 02:31:47.097
AND IF WE CAN ASK ANY OTHER

02:31:47.164 --> 02:31:48.632
QUESTIONS ABOUT ACA, PLEASE DO

02:31:48.699 --> 02:31:49.967
SO. AND I COMPLETELY AGREE AND I

02:31:50.034 --> 02:31:52.570
UNDERSTAND AND YOU KNOW IT. I

02:31:52.636 --> 02:31:53.804
MEAN, I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A

02:31:53.871 --> 02:31:55.940
TIME LIMIT ON ME FOR SOMETHING

02:31:56.006 --> 02:31:57.541
THAT WE JUST HEARD HAD THOUSANDS

02:31:57.608 --> 02:31:58.943
OF HOURS OF NEGOTIATION,

02:31:59.009 --> 02:32:00.511
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND

02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:02.613
THOUSANDS OF HOURS AND COMMUNITY

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:04.415
MEETINGS, HUNDREDS OF MEETINGS.

02:32:04.482 --> 02:32:06.317
AND NOW I'M BEING ATTEMPTED TO

02:32:06.383 --> 02:32:08.919
STOP WITH 20 MINUTES OF

02:32:08.986 --> 02:32:10.254
QUESTIONING. I'M JUST WORRY US,

02:32:10.321 --> 02:32:11.522
MADAM CHAIR, WHEN IT COMES TO

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:12.690
THE EXCUSE ME, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:32:12.756 --> 02:32:14.959
BENNETT, IT IT IS ALWAYS

02:32:15.025 --> 02:32:16.727
APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHAIR TO

02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:18.429
IDENTIFY WHEN AN APPROPRIATE

02:32:18.496 --> 02:32:20.698
TIME LIMIT HAS COME. THAT'S

02:32:20.764 --> 02:32:23.334
THAT'S NORMAL PROCEDURE. SO YES,

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:25.102
AT SOME POINT IN TIME I'M NOT

02:32:25.169 --> 02:32:26.504
SAYING IT'S 20 MINUTES. IT'S UP

02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:28.239
TO THE CHAIR. BUT THE ISSUE

02:32:28.305 --> 02:32:31.108
SHOULD BE HOW MUCH TIME IS TOO

02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:33.377
MUCH TIME FOR ANYBODY TO TAKE TO

02:32:33.444 --> 02:32:35.145
DOMINATE SO THAT WE CAN GO ON

02:32:35.212 --> 02:32:37.014
AND DO THE LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS

02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:39.350
SO THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T ABUSE

02:32:39.416 --> 02:32:42.253
THIS PRIVILEGE THAT WE ALL HAVE

02:32:42.319 --> 02:32:42.853
TO SPEAK HERE. SO WE HAVE WE

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:46.056
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO, AND WE

02:32:46.123 --> 02:32:46.891
WANT TO KEEP THE QUESTIONS TO

02:32:46.957 --> 02:32:48.959
THE CONTENT AND MERITS OF THE

02:32:49.026 --> 02:32:50.394
BILL. OKAY. WELL THEN I WILL

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:52.363
CONTINUE. HOPEFULLY. MR. BERMAN,

02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:54.865
UP TO THE CHAIR. YOU DO YOU HAVE

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:56.233
ANOTHER QUESTION? I HAVE I DO

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:57.368
OKAY. UNDER THE NEW

02:32:57.434 --> 02:32:58.769
REDISTRICTING PROPOSAL, FRESNO

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:00.104
WOULD BE SPLIT INTO FOUR

02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.604
DIFFERENT CONGRESSIONAL

02:33:00.671 --> 02:33:01.839
DISTRICTS. HOW DOES THAT BENEFIT

02:33:01.906 --> 02:33:03.274
THE CITY OF FRESNO? OKAY, AGAIN,

02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:04.942
WE'RE NOT DOING THE CONTENT OF

02:33:05.009 --> 02:33:07.011
THE DISTRICTS. THIS IS ABOUT THE

02:33:07.077 --> 02:33:08.913
ACA EIGHT. THAT IS THAT IS

02:33:08.979 --> 02:33:11.081
PUTTING THE MEASURE BEFORE THE

02:33:11.148 --> 02:33:13.684
VOTERS TO DO A CONSTITUTIONAL

02:33:13.751 --> 02:33:15.786
AMENDMENT. THAT IS WHAT WE'RE

02:33:15.853 --> 02:33:17.221
TALKING ABOUT HERE. THE OTHER

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:19.623
BILL IS GOING TO BE THE CONTENTS

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:20.658
OF THE BILL IN ACA EIGHT. IT

02:33:20.724 --> 02:33:23.961
STATES AB 604 AND THE MAPS. HOW

02:33:24.028 --> 02:33:25.896
IS THAT NOT PERTINENT TO THIS?

02:33:25.963 --> 02:33:27.731
BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:33:27.798 --> 02:33:29.633
SPEAKING TO THE AUTHOR OF THAT

02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:30.901
BILL, AS FAR AS THE MAP AND THE

02:33:30.968 --> 02:33:33.070
LINES AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING,

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:34.138
THERE IS A DIRECT LINE BETWEEN

02:33:34.204 --> 02:33:39.109
WHAT CAN BE DONE. SO SORRY, AB

02:33:39.176 --> 02:33:42.146
604 DOESN'T PASS. THEN AC EIGHT

02:33:42.212 --> 02:33:43.213
NO LONGER MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:44.548
IT CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S WRITTEN

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:46.517
INTO THE LEGISLATION I'M TRYING

02:33:46.584 --> 02:33:47.818
TO UNDERSTAND. LET'S SEE IF

02:33:47.885 --> 02:33:48.986
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN HAS A

02:33:49.053 --> 02:33:49.920
RESPONSE. I'LL DEFER TO THE

02:33:49.987 --> 02:33:51.889
AUTHORS OF THAT BILL WHEN THEY

02:33:51.956 --> 02:33:53.857
PRESENT THAT BILL IN FRONT OF

02:33:53.924 --> 02:33:55.092
THIS COMMITTEE, I'M GUESSING

02:33:55.159 --> 02:33:55.659
AROUND MIDNIGHT, TO GIVE AN

02:33:55.726 --> 02:33:57.127
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE

02:33:57.194 --> 02:33:59.663
SPECIFIC LINE DRAWING OF

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:00.798
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES, LIKE I

02:34:00.864 --> 02:34:02.166
MENTIONED ABOUT HALF AN HOUR

02:34:02.232 --> 02:34:04.068
AGO. OKAY. THANK YOU. SO WHEN

02:34:04.134 --> 02:34:05.769
WILL THE PUBLIC COMMENTS BE

02:34:05.836 --> 02:34:07.037
RELEASED TO THE MEMBERS OF THE

02:34:07.104 --> 02:34:10.107
COMMITTEE? AND OKAY, I'M SORRY,

02:34:10.174 --> 02:34:11.442
WHEN WILL THE PUBLIC COMMENTS BE

02:34:11.508 --> 02:34:13.611
RELEASED TO THE MEMBERS OF THE

02:34:13.677 --> 02:34:14.745
COMMITTEE? IT'S NOT A QUESTION

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:16.013
FOR ME. THAT'S A THAT'S UP TO

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.214
THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. SO

02:34:17.281 --> 02:34:18.382
WE'RE FOLLOWING THE TYPICAL

02:34:18.449 --> 02:34:19.383
PROCEDURES FOR COMMENTS. AND

02:34:19.450 --> 02:34:21.619
THOSE WILL BE THEY'RE NOT

02:34:21.685 --> 02:34:23.187
THEY'RE PUBLIC TO OUR MEMBERS.

02:34:23.253 --> 02:34:25.155
AND THEN THEY WILL BE MADE

02:34:25.222 --> 02:34:27.558
PUBLIC AFTER THE BILL IS

02:34:27.625 --> 02:34:32.730
PROCESSED. AND OKAY, HOW ARE WE

02:34:32.796 --> 02:34:35.599
SUPPOSED TO VOTE ON THIS WHEN WE

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:37.635
HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THOSE PUBLIC

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.703
COMMENTS? YOU HAVE THE FIVE PAGE

02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:42.106
BILL IN FRONT OF YOU. AND SO I

02:34:42.172 --> 02:34:43.907
THINK THAT WHAT YOU ARE VOTING

02:34:43.974 --> 02:34:45.809
ON IS, IS THE BILL. IT IS NOT

02:34:45.876 --> 02:34:47.911
THE PUBLIC COMMENTS. SO ON THAT

02:34:47.978 --> 02:34:50.748
FIVE PAGE BILL, IT STATES AB 604

02:34:50.814 --> 02:34:53.083
AND SB 280, THOSE THOSE BILLS

02:34:53.150 --> 02:34:55.119
ARE HUNDREDS OF PAGES LONG SINCE

02:34:55.185 --> 02:34:56.987
THEY'RE ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER.

02:34:57.054 --> 02:34:57.921
HAVE YOU READ THOSE? I HAVE NOT

02:34:57.988 --> 02:34:59.757
READ EVERY PAGE OF THOSE BILLS.

02:34:59.823 --> 02:35:01.659
OKAY. YEAH, IT TOOK ME A LITTLE

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:02.893
WHILE BECAUSE I BET THOSE ARE

02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.828
LONGER THAN THIS ONE. IT IS.

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:06.563
YEAH. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:08.032
SINCE THEY'RE ATTACHED TO EACH

02:35:08.098 --> 02:35:09.767
OTHER. YEAH. THEY CANNOT PASS

02:35:09.833 --> 02:35:11.301
WITHOUT THE OTHER ONE NOT

02:35:11.368 --> 02:35:13.437
PASSING. I REALLY DO THINK THE

02:35:13.504 --> 02:35:14.638
MERITS OF ONE OR THE OTHER ARE

02:35:14.705 --> 02:35:17.307
VERY IMPORTANT TO THAT. AND SO

02:35:17.374 --> 02:35:19.576
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE MAPS

02:35:19.643 --> 02:35:22.413
ARE STRUCK DOWN IN COURT, AND

02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:24.148
WE'RE ABOUT TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF

02:35:24.214 --> 02:35:25.416
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE OF

02:35:25.482 --> 02:35:26.817
THE WAY THAT WE'VE DONE THIS

02:35:26.884 --> 02:35:29.286
WITH SUCH URGENCY? I'M NOT

02:35:29.353 --> 02:35:30.954
PREPARED TO PREDICT WHAT THE

02:35:31.021 --> 02:35:32.322
COURTS MIGHT DO. OKAY. YES.

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:34.692
COULD I MAKE A MOTION THAT EVERY

02:35:34.758 --> 02:35:37.695
MEMBER'S TIME SPEAKING HERE IS

02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:55.479
LIMITED TO 25 MINUTES?

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.061
AND I'M TRYING TO PROVIDE

02:36:11.128 --> 02:36:12.563
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK

02:36:12.629 --> 02:36:13.997
TO THE MEASURES AND ASK THE

02:36:14.064 --> 02:36:15.733
QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE. I KNOW

02:36:15.799 --> 02:36:17.468
THIS IS A VERY FAST MOVING

02:36:17.534 --> 02:36:18.102
PROCESS. I'VE ALREADY EXPLAINED

02:36:18.168 --> 02:36:19.603
THE REASON WHY WE ARE MOVING

02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:21.905
QUICKLY ON THIS ISSUE, AND I

02:36:21.972 --> 02:36:23.373
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABUSING

02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.409
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ASK

02:36:25.476 --> 02:36:26.510
PERTINENT QUESTIONS RELATED TO

02:36:26.577 --> 02:36:31.482
THE BILLS. SO GIVE ME ONE SECOND

02:36:31.548 --> 02:36:35.953
HERE. USING IT. I THINK 40

02:36:36.019 --> 02:36:37.254
MILLION PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:40.457
ARE ABUSING THE BILL. THEY'RE

02:36:40.524 --> 02:36:43.494
GOING TO DO THIS. SO IF YOU

02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:45.562
DON'T HAVE A TIME LIMIT. SO I

02:36:45.629 --> 02:36:46.663
BELIEVE THE QUESTIONS YOU'VE

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:48.365
ASKED SO FAR HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.

02:36:48.432 --> 02:36:49.900
DO YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL

02:36:49.967 --> 02:36:51.201
QUESTIONS? YES, MA'AM. YOU MAY

02:36:51.268 --> 02:36:53.070
GO AHEAD AND ASK ANOTHER ONE.

02:36:53.137 --> 02:36:57.374
THANK YOU. IS THERE A WORK INTO

02:36:57.441 --> 02:36:58.909
THE BILL WITH THE FISCAL COST OF

02:36:58.976 --> 02:37:00.778
LEGAL CHALLENGES? I'M SORRY. SAY

02:37:00.844 --> 02:37:02.513
THAT ONE MORE TIME. IS THERE A

02:37:02.579 --> 02:37:04.348
IS THERE A WORK INTO THE BILL

02:37:04.414 --> 02:37:05.716
FOR LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE

02:37:05.783 --> 02:37:07.684
THAT I PRESUME ARE GOING TO SHOW

02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:10.053
UP LEFT AND RIGHT? IS THERE WORK

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:12.656
IN THE BILL? DO WE IS THERE A

02:37:12.723 --> 02:37:14.858
WHEN LAWSUITS HAPPEN HAPPEN.

02:37:14.925 --> 02:37:17.628
YEAH. DO WE HAVE ARE WE PREPARED

02:37:17.694 --> 02:37:19.129
FOR THAT WITH THIS ACA? WE HAVE

02:37:19.196 --> 02:37:21.465
A VERY ROBUST DEPARTMENT OF

02:37:21.532 --> 02:37:23.133
JUSTICE THAT IS PREPARED TO

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.602
DEFEND NEW LAWS THAT ARE PASSED

02:37:25.669 --> 02:37:27.070
BY THE LEGISLATURE? YES. THE WAY

02:37:27.137 --> 02:37:28.505
THAT THE DISTRICTS ARE DRAWN,

02:37:28.572 --> 02:37:32.176
YOU KNOW, IS IT'S REALLY WORRIES

02:37:32.242 --> 02:37:33.944
ME THAT IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR

02:37:34.011 --> 02:37:35.979
US TO NOT JUST SPEND THE $300

02:37:36.046 --> 02:37:37.648
MILLION TO GET THIS ONTO THE

02:37:37.714 --> 02:37:39.983
BALLOT, BUT THEN TO OPEN UP OUR

02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:41.118
COMMUNITIES AND THE STATE OF

02:37:41.185 --> 02:37:43.921
CALIFORNIA INTO MORE LITIGATION.

02:37:43.987 --> 02:37:46.757
SO WHEN THE LAWSUITS HAPPEN AT

02:37:46.824 --> 02:37:48.559
THE LOCAL COUNTY LEVEL AS WELL,

02:37:48.625 --> 02:37:50.060
BECAUSE THEY'RE SPLIT UP, WHO'S

02:37:50.127 --> 02:37:52.596
GOING TO PAY FOR THAT? WELL,

02:37:52.663 --> 02:37:54.264
ACTUALLY, A BIG DISTINCTION

02:37:54.331 --> 02:37:55.799
BETWEEN THESE MAPS THAT WERE

02:37:55.866 --> 02:37:57.634
DRAWN IN CALIFORNIA AND THE MAPS

02:37:57.701 --> 02:37:58.702
THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PASSED

02:37:58.769 --> 02:38:00.971
BY THE STATE OF TEXAS, FOR

02:38:01.038 --> 02:38:01.839
EXAMPLE, ARE CALIFORNIA'S MAPS.

02:38:01.905 --> 02:38:04.107
MAPS STRICTLY ABIDE BY THE

02:38:04.174 --> 02:38:05.542
FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT, WHICH

02:38:05.609 --> 02:38:08.645
THE TEXAS MAPS DON'T. AND SO

02:38:08.712 --> 02:38:11.281
WE'VE ACTUALLY PUT OURSELVES IN

02:38:11.348 --> 02:38:13.617
A VERY GOOD POSITION TO DEFEND

02:38:13.684 --> 02:38:15.586
THE MAPS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAWN,

02:38:15.652 --> 02:38:17.888
BECAUSE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT

02:38:17.955 --> 02:38:19.389
AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE VOTING

02:38:19.456 --> 02:38:22.125
RIGHTS ACT WERE TAKEN INTO VERY

02:38:22.192 --> 02:38:23.527
HIGH CONSIDERATION WHEN THOSE

02:38:23.594 --> 02:38:25.128
MAPS WERE DRAWN. WELL, THAT'S

02:38:25.195 --> 02:38:25.762
INTERESTING. THE STATEMENT THAT

02:38:25.829 --> 02:38:27.865
YOU MADE IS THAT TEXAS DID NOT

02:38:27.931 --> 02:38:29.299
FOLLOW THAT. CORRECT? OKAY. IT'S

02:38:29.366 --> 02:38:31.368
BAD. SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:34.004
TEXAS HAS TO REDRAW? IT DEPENDS

02:38:34.071 --> 02:38:36.773
ON WHAT THE COURTS DO. I'M NOT A

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:39.543
JUDGE OKAY. AGAIN, CAN WE BRING

02:38:39.610 --> 02:38:41.845
THE CONVERSATION BACK TO THE

02:38:41.912 --> 02:38:43.714
MERITS OF ACA. THIS THIS BILL IS

02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:45.582
WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY TRIGGERING

02:38:45.649 --> 02:38:47.251
IF TEXAS REDISTRICTING. SO IT'S

02:38:47.317 --> 02:38:50.187
IN THE BILL. THE NAME TEXAS IS

02:38:50.254 --> 02:38:52.689
THE QUESTION IF TEXAS IF TEXAS

02:38:52.756 --> 02:38:56.360
MAPS ARE THROWN OUT, WHICH WOULD

02:38:56.426 --> 02:38:58.128
THIS MOVE FORWARD. IS THAT THE

02:38:58.195 --> 02:38:59.863
QUESTION I CAN ASK YOUR I'LL GO

02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:01.665
AHEAD AND ASK LEGAL COUNSEL. BUT

02:39:01.732 --> 02:39:03.767
SO THE QUESTION IS JUST SO I

02:39:03.834 --> 02:39:04.801
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION, IF

02:39:04.868 --> 02:39:06.003
TEXAS'S MAPS ARE DETERMINED TO

02:39:06.069 --> 02:39:07.804
BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE

02:39:07.871 --> 02:39:09.907
COURTS, THEN WOULD CALIFORNIA

02:39:09.973 --> 02:39:11.742
WOULD THAT TRIGGER ACTUALLY

02:39:11.808 --> 02:39:13.343
TRIGGER FOR THE ACA? I THINK

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:14.611
THAT'S THE QUESTION. WELL, IT

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:15.913
ACTUALLY STATES IF THEY GET A

02:39:15.979 --> 02:39:17.447
COURT ORDER, IT DOESN'T TRIGGER

02:39:17.514 --> 02:39:19.316
IT. WELL THAT SO THAT WAS PUT IN

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:21.051
THERE, I BELIEVE IN REGARDS TO

02:39:21.118 --> 02:39:22.686
SOME OTHER STATES, MAYBE OHIO.

02:39:22.753 --> 02:39:25.188
IS IT THAT FLORIDA HAS FLORIDA

02:39:25.255 --> 02:39:27.491
HAS SOME DIFFERENT SITUATIONS

02:39:27.557 --> 02:39:29.393
FOR TEXAS. THAT'S THE

02:39:29.459 --> 02:39:30.394
LEGISLATURE. THERE'S NO COURT.

02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:31.795
AND I KNOW YOU ALLUDED EARLIER

02:39:31.862 --> 02:39:33.230
TO THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF

02:39:33.297 --> 02:39:34.264
JUSTICE. THEY'RE NOT A COURT,

02:39:34.331 --> 02:39:36.667
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW TRUMP WANTS

02:39:36.733 --> 02:39:37.668
THEM TO BE. AND SO THAT IS NOT

02:39:37.734 --> 02:39:39.469
ACTUALLY WHEN THE DOJ SENDS A

02:39:39.536 --> 02:39:40.771
LETTER TO TEXAS. THAT'S NOT A

02:39:40.837 --> 02:39:43.473
COURT ORDER. BUT BUT IF I

02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:44.875
BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS, IF THE

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:47.411
TEXAS MAPS ARE THROWN OUT BY THE

02:39:47.477 --> 02:39:49.212
COURTS, WOULD CALIFORNIA AND NO

02:39:49.279 --> 02:39:51.949
OTHER STATE HAS HAS PASSED A

02:39:52.015 --> 02:39:53.784
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDER? WOULD

02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:55.619
TEXAS WOULD CALIFORNIANS MOVE

02:39:55.686 --> 02:39:57.154
FORWARD? AM I UNDERSTANDING JUST

02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:59.022
THE CRUX OF THE QUESTION? YES.

02:39:59.089 --> 02:39:59.790
GREAT. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS

02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:02.025
ON THAT? THE WAY THE AS YOU

02:40:02.092 --> 02:40:03.593
POINT OUT, THE WAY THAT THE

02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:04.962
TRIGGER WORKS IN THE MEASURE IS

02:40:05.028 --> 02:40:06.830
THAT IT'S ONLY TRIGGERED IF OR

02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:08.632
IT WOULD NOT BE TRIGGERED IF

02:40:08.699 --> 02:40:10.767
ANOTHER STATE, INCLUDING TEXAS,

02:40:10.834 --> 02:40:12.202
IS FORCED TO REDISTRICT, IS

02:40:12.269 --> 02:40:12.903
REQUIRED TO REDISTRICT BY

02:40:12.970 --> 02:40:14.738
FEDERAL COURT ORDER. SO THAT'S

02:40:14.805 --> 02:40:17.274
CORRECT. SO TEXAS DECIDED TO

02:40:17.341 --> 02:40:20.277
STOP, AND THEN THEY GOT A COURT

02:40:20.344 --> 02:40:21.979
ORDER. WE WOULD PUT THIS ON THE

02:40:22.045 --> 02:40:24.081
BALLOT, SPEND 300 MILLIONS OF

02:40:24.147 --> 02:40:25.382
DOLLARS, AND THEN WE COULDN'T

02:40:25.449 --> 02:40:26.950
EVEN REDISTRICT BECAUSE OF THAT

02:40:27.017 --> 02:40:29.820
WORK IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER, I AGREE

02:40:29.886 --> 02:40:31.421
WITH YOU THAT I WISH TEXAS

02:40:31.488 --> 02:40:33.457
WASN'T DOING THIS. AND, YOU

02:40:33.523 --> 02:40:34.658
KNOW, THIS WAS NOT ON MY BINGO

02:40:34.725 --> 02:40:37.127
CARD A MONTH AGO WHEN WE BROKE

02:40:37.194 --> 02:40:39.596
FOR SUMMER RECESS. BUT

02:40:39.663 --> 02:40:41.565
UNFORTUNATELY, UNDER THE EDICT

02:40:41.631 --> 02:40:44.968
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, TEXAS

02:40:45.035 --> 02:40:48.572
REPUBLICANS ARE RUSHING THROUGH.

02:40:48.638 --> 02:40:50.007
THAT'S NOT A PARTIZAN

02:40:50.073 --> 02:40:50.674
REDISTRICTING. THERE WAS A

02:40:50.741 --> 02:40:53.610
LAWSUIT ON THE WAY IN GALVESTON,

02:40:53.677 --> 02:40:56.213
TEXAS. I MEAN, I JUST ASK FOR

02:40:56.279 --> 02:40:57.647
THE SAME COMMON COURTESY THAT

02:40:57.714 --> 02:40:59.082
YOU DEMANDED. THANK YOU, SIR,

02:40:59.149 --> 02:41:00.884
BUT THERE IS A AND SO I'M SORRY

02:41:00.951 --> 02:41:02.619
AGAIN, ONE PERSON, ONE PERSON AT

02:41:02.686 --> 02:41:04.755
A TIME, PLEASE. THANK YOU. AND

02:41:04.821 --> 02:41:06.189
SO WHEN TEXAS WHEN TRUMP

02:41:06.256 --> 02:41:07.591
DEMANDED, I'M SORRY, LET ME GET

02:41:07.657 --> 02:41:09.860
THIS STRAIGHT. WHEN TRUMP SAID

02:41:09.926 --> 02:41:14.231
OUT LOUD THAT HE WAS ENTITLED

02:41:14.297 --> 02:41:16.366
ENTITLED TO FIVE ADDITIONAL

02:41:16.433 --> 02:41:17.367
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL

02:41:17.434 --> 02:41:18.935
DISTRICTS IN TEXAS, WHICH FOR

02:41:19.002 --> 02:41:20.704
THE RECORD IS AN INSANE THING

02:41:20.771 --> 02:41:22.105
FOR ANY PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

02:41:22.172 --> 02:41:24.274
STATES TO THINK, LET ALONE SAY

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:26.243
OUT LOUD. BUT WHEN HE SAID THAT

02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:27.744
HE WAS ENTITLED TO FIVE MORE

02:41:27.811 --> 02:41:29.079
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL

02:41:29.146 --> 02:41:31.281
DISTRICTS IN TEXAS AND ALL THE

02:41:31.348 --> 02:41:33.216
TEXAS LEGISLATORS IMMEDIATELY

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:35.052
LINED UP TO DO WHATEVER TRUMP

02:41:35.118 --> 02:41:38.955
WANTED, THAT FORCED US TO, TO

02:41:39.022 --> 02:41:39.723
PUT THIS TOGETHER, NOT BECAUSE

02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:43.193
WE WANT TO, BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:45.028
TO. AND THAT'S WHY THE TRIGGER

02:41:45.095 --> 02:41:46.897
LANGUAGE IS IN. AND THAT'S WHY

02:41:46.963 --> 02:41:48.698
THE TRIGGER LANGUAGE IS IN THE

02:41:48.765 --> 02:41:49.733
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:52.135
SAYS IF TEXAS BACKS DOWN, WHICH

02:41:52.202 --> 02:41:55.806
I REALLY HOPE THEY DO, IF TEXAS

02:41:55.872 --> 02:41:59.709
BACKS DOWN FROM THEIR PARTIZAN

02:41:59.776 --> 02:42:02.679
GERRYMANDER, PER THE EDICT OF

02:42:02.746 --> 02:42:05.515
TRUMP AND HIS ENTITLEMENTS, THEN

02:42:05.582 --> 02:42:07.317
THIS WILL NOT GO INTO EFFECT.

02:42:07.384 --> 02:42:08.385
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY THAT'S

02:42:08.452 --> 02:42:10.153
THERE. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:13.023
SAYING IS BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS

02:42:13.090 --> 02:42:15.258
LAWSUITS LIKE PETTY VÆ GALVESTON

02:42:15.325 --> 02:42:17.327
COUNTY, WHICH WENT THROUGH IN

02:42:17.394 --> 02:42:18.962
TEXAS AT THE FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT

02:42:19.029 --> 02:42:20.764
OF APPEALS AND IS NOW SITTING ON

02:42:20.831 --> 02:42:22.799
THE DOCKET FOR THE SUPREME COURT

02:42:22.866 --> 02:42:24.201
TO WEIGH IN ON THAT HAPPENED IN

02:42:24.267 --> 02:42:25.469
TEXAS, CLAIMING THAT SOME OF

02:42:25.535 --> 02:42:29.372
THEIR THEIR DISTRICTS WERE SEEN

02:42:29.439 --> 02:42:31.541
AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THAT IF

02:42:31.608 --> 02:42:33.110
THEY RECEIVE A COURT ORDER. AND

02:42:33.176 --> 02:42:34.711
THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:42:34.778 --> 02:42:35.745
ME, IF THEY RECEIVE A COURT

02:42:35.812 --> 02:42:37.781
ORDER BECAUSE THEY BACK DOWN AND

02:42:37.848 --> 02:42:39.349
STOP, THEN WE IN THE STATE OF

02:42:39.416 --> 02:42:41.885
CALIFORNIA ARE ABOUT TO SPEND

02:42:41.952 --> 02:42:44.187
$300 MILLION TO DO NOTHING. SO

02:42:44.254 --> 02:42:45.789
THAT'S THE PART THAT IS THE

02:42:45.856 --> 02:42:47.657
ISSUE. OKAY. I THINK WE HAVE A

02:42:47.724 --> 02:42:49.860
POINT OF ORDER. THIS IS A CLEAR

02:42:49.926 --> 02:42:51.628
ABUSE. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY

02:42:51.695 --> 02:42:53.296
TO STRETCH THIS OUT. VERY

02:42:53.363 --> 02:42:55.132
PERSONAL, CLEAR ABUSE OF THE

02:42:55.198 --> 02:42:56.800
DISCRETION THAT WE ALL HAVE.

02:42:56.867 --> 02:42:58.034
THANK YOU. I'M TRYING TO BE

02:42:58.101 --> 02:43:00.637
PATIENT WITH YOU AND YOU HAVE

02:43:00.704 --> 02:43:01.872
BEEN ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS

02:43:01.938 --> 02:43:03.974
OVER AGAIN, AND YOUR QUESTIONS

02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:06.042
HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. THIS AUTHOR

02:43:06.109 --> 02:43:07.711
IS NOT PREPARED TO OTHER

02:43:07.777 --> 02:43:09.746
SPEAKERS. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON

02:43:09.813 --> 02:43:10.914
TO SOME OTHER QUESTIONS IN

02:43:10.981 --> 02:43:12.516
REGARDS TO THE BILL. TO ME,

02:43:12.582 --> 02:43:14.618
BECAUSE OF THE COST AND THE MAIN

02:43:14.684 --> 02:43:15.685
REASON AND THE COST HAS BEEN

02:43:15.752 --> 02:43:17.888
STATED VERY CLEARLY. DOES ANY

02:43:17.954 --> 02:43:18.822
OTHER MEMBER HAVE A QUESTION IN

02:43:18.889 --> 02:43:20.857
REGARDS TO ACA EIGHT IT BUT

02:43:20.924 --> 02:43:22.893
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, MADAM

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:24.761
CHAIR. PLEASE GIVE ME ONE

02:43:24.828 --> 02:43:26.596
MINUTE, PLEASE. I'M ASKING THIS

02:43:26.663 --> 02:43:29.199
ENTIRE BREAK. MR. I HAVE ONE

02:43:29.266 --> 02:43:30.867
THING TO SAY RIGHT HERE. I'M

02:43:30.934 --> 02:43:32.068
ASKING TO SEE IF ANY OTHER

02:43:32.135 --> 02:43:33.403
MEMBER HAS QUESTIONS IN REGARDS

02:43:33.470 --> 02:43:35.405
TO THIS BILL. MY SISTER WAS PUT

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:36.573
ON HOSPICE BECAUSE THE STATE OF

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:38.475
CALIFORNIA COULDN'T AFFORD TO

02:43:38.542 --> 02:43:39.676
PAY IT ANY MORE BECAUSE SHE WAS

02:43:39.743 --> 02:43:42.379
ON MEDI-CAL. OKAY, I DO NOT. I

02:43:42.445 --> 02:43:44.214
AM SORRY FOR THAT. DESTROYS THE

02:43:44.281 --> 02:43:45.549
FUNDING. WE NEED TO BRING

02:43:45.615 --> 02:43:47.350
CONTROL BACK TO THIS. AND SO I'M

02:43:47.417 --> 02:43:48.852
ASKING I'M TRYING TO GET SOME

02:43:48.919 --> 02:43:50.520
CONTROL HERE. AND YOU ARE

02:43:50.587 --> 02:43:52.455
SPEAKING WHEN I'M ASKING YOU TO

02:43:52.522 --> 02:43:53.857
PLEASE STOP. JUST GIVE ME ONE

02:43:53.924 --> 02:43:55.625
MINUTE HERE. I'M ASKING IF ANY

02:43:55.692 --> 02:43:58.562
OTHER MEMBER HAS A QUESTION IN

02:43:58.628 --> 02:44:00.697
RELATIONSHIP TO ACA EIGHT. WE'VE

02:44:00.764 --> 02:44:02.165
BEEN GIVING YOU PLENTY OF TIME

02:44:02.232 --> 02:44:04.668
TO ASK QUESTIONS, AND YOU'RE

02:44:04.734 --> 02:44:06.102
ASKING THE SAME QUESTION OVER

02:44:06.169 --> 02:44:08.238
AGAIN. THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:10.073
ANSWERED. GIVE ME ONE SECOND TO

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:11.908
SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS SOMETHING

02:44:11.975 --> 02:44:13.910
TO SAY. CAN YOU PLEASE YIELD THE

02:44:13.977 --> 02:44:15.145
FLOOR TO SOMEBODY ELSE FOR A

02:44:15.212 --> 02:44:16.980
MINUTE TO THEN RETURN AND ASK

02:44:17.047 --> 02:44:18.715
MORE QUESTIONS? BECAUSE THE

02:44:18.782 --> 02:44:19.282
FUNDING IS IMPORTANT AND THE

02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:20.550
FUNDING HAS BEEN CLEARLY STATED.

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:21.918
SO ANY OTHER MEMBER HAVE A

02:44:21.985 --> 02:44:23.253
QUESTION? I HAVE ANOTHER

02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:24.888
QUESTION FOR THE FUNDING FOR

02:44:24.955 --> 02:44:25.822
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNET. YES, I

02:44:25.889 --> 02:44:29.059
HAVE TWO QUICK POINTS. YES,

02:44:29.125 --> 02:44:30.627
EVERY ONE OF THESE ISSUES IS

02:44:30.694 --> 02:44:31.661
IMPORTANT FUNDING, ETC. BUT THE

02:44:31.728 --> 02:44:33.163
OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS

02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:35.432
THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:44:35.498 --> 02:44:37.534
MEET CERTAIN TIME FRAMES TO BE

02:44:37.601 --> 02:44:38.969
ABLE TO ACTUALLY ADOPT

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:40.270
LEGISLATION. AND SO IT IS

02:44:40.337 --> 02:44:42.105
APPROPRIATE FOR US TO WEIGH ALL

02:44:42.172 --> 02:44:44.174
OF THESE ISSUES, THE IMPORTANT

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:45.976
ISSUES OF THE BILL, BUT ALSO THE

02:44:46.042 --> 02:44:47.644
TIMING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO

02:44:47.711 --> 02:44:48.945
OPERATE UNDER. THIS IS NOT THE

02:44:49.012 --> 02:44:51.081
ONLY BILL THAT THAT THIS

02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:52.716
ASSEMBLY IS GOING TO DEAL WITH.

02:44:52.782 --> 02:44:54.751
BUT I MENTIONED A NUMBER OF

02:44:54.818 --> 02:44:56.052
TECHNIQUES THAT AUTOCRATS USE

02:44:56.119 --> 02:44:58.421
WHEN THEY TRY TO GRAB POWER. AND

02:44:58.488 --> 02:45:01.558
IT IS DECEIT AND IT IS

02:45:01.625 --> 02:45:02.926
INTIMIDATION. AND INTIMIDATION

02:45:02.993 --> 02:45:04.427
COMES IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT

02:45:04.494 --> 02:45:05.795
FORMS. IT'S THE MILITARIZATION

02:45:05.862 --> 02:45:07.097
OF CIVILIAN LIFE, BUT PROBABLY

02:45:07.163 --> 02:45:08.498
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THINGS

02:45:08.565 --> 02:45:11.001
BEING USED IS LITERALLY

02:45:11.067 --> 02:45:12.836
DESTRUCTION OF THE PUBLIC WITH

02:45:12.902 --> 02:45:14.471
ALL KINDS OF OTHER ISSUES.

02:45:14.537 --> 02:45:17.040
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE BASIC

02:45:17.107 --> 02:45:18.842
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. AND SO WE'LL

02:45:18.908 --> 02:45:21.411
TALK ABOUT HOW COOL WAS THE

02:45:21.478 --> 02:45:22.445
REDISTRICTING THAT WE DID

02:45:22.512 --> 02:45:25.348
BEFORE. WE ALL AGREE IT WAS

02:45:25.415 --> 02:45:27.851
COOL. THE QUESTION IS, IS THAT

02:45:27.917 --> 02:45:30.020
GOING BACK TO THAT, IS THAT

02:45:30.086 --> 02:45:31.421
GOING TO PROTECT US FROM THIS

02:45:31.488 --> 02:45:33.923
POWER GRAB BY AUTOCRATS? AND

02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:35.759
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

02:45:35.825 --> 02:45:37.560
WE DON'T GET DISTRACTED BY THE

02:45:37.627 --> 02:45:39.496
KABUKI THEATER THAT'S GOING ON

02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:41.464
THAT SAYS, COME UP WITH ANYTHING

02:45:41.531 --> 02:45:43.199
YOU CAN TO DISTRACT PEOPLE FROM

02:45:43.266 --> 02:45:45.535
THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE, A

02:45:45.602 --> 02:45:47.671
POWER GRAB BY AUTOCRATS THAT

02:45:47.737 --> 02:45:49.472
CAN'T BE FOUGHT BY THE OLD

02:45:49.539 --> 02:45:52.008
RULES. SO WE NEED TWO THINGS.

02:45:52.075 --> 02:45:53.376
ONE, TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT

02:45:53.443 --> 02:45:54.944
AND TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT

02:45:55.011 --> 02:45:56.646
THAT WE HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

02:45:56.713 --> 02:45:58.448
TIME TO GET THE LEGISLATIVE

02:45:58.515 --> 02:45:59.549
BUSINESS DONE, AND IT'S

02:45:59.616 --> 02:46:00.950
APPROPRIATE FOR US ALL TO BE

02:46:01.017 --> 02:46:03.186
LIMITED INTO HOW MUCH TIME WE

02:46:03.253 --> 02:46:04.654
GET TO TALK, BECAUSE NONE OF US

02:46:04.721 --> 02:46:06.022
EVEN ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR, WE

02:46:06.089 --> 02:46:07.857
HAVE A FIVE MINUTE RULE,

02:46:07.924 --> 02:46:09.225
CERTAINLY IN A COMMITTEE, WE

02:46:09.292 --> 02:46:10.827
COULD HAVE SOME KIND OF RULE

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:12.429
THAT SAYS YOU DON'T GET AN

02:46:12.495 --> 02:46:14.631
UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. THE

02:46:14.698 --> 02:46:17.200
CHAIR I STRONGLY REQUEST WILL

02:46:17.267 --> 02:46:18.568
ASSERT THAT. THANK YOU.

02:46:18.635 --> 02:46:20.070
ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK WE'VE

02:46:20.136 --> 02:46:21.171
DELIBERATED ON THIS MEASURE

02:46:21.237 --> 02:46:24.007
QUITE A BIT, AS ARE ANY OTHER

02:46:24.074 --> 02:46:24.941
MEMBER WHO HAS A QUESTION.

02:46:25.008 --> 02:46:27.277
ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEPHANIE, NOT

02:46:27.344 --> 02:46:29.079
SO MUCH A QUESTION. I JUST WANT

02:46:29.145 --> 02:46:30.280
TO WEIGH IN. THANK YOU, MADAM

02:46:30.347 --> 02:46:32.582
CHAIR, FOR THIS HEARING, AND I

02:46:32.649 --> 02:46:34.351
WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:46:34.417 --> 02:46:38.054
BERMAN FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL.

02:46:38.121 --> 02:46:41.825
AND I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND

02:46:41.891 --> 02:46:42.692
ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE

02:46:42.759 --> 02:46:44.227
COMMENTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:46.129
BENNETT IN TERMS OF THE THEATER

02:46:46.196 --> 02:46:47.630
THAT WE ARE WITNESSING HERE, IT

02:46:47.697 --> 02:46:49.899
IS ABSOLUTE THEATER. WE ALL

02:46:49.966 --> 02:46:53.169
KNOW. WE ALL KNOW HOW WE FEEL

02:46:53.236 --> 02:46:55.705
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TEXAS.

02:46:55.772 --> 02:46:57.774
YOU FEEL ONE WAY, WE FEEL

02:46:57.841 --> 02:47:00.343
ANOTHER. WE ARE RESPONDING TO

02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:02.579
WHAT TEXAS IS DOING. THAT IS

02:47:02.645 --> 02:47:04.681
ALL. THAT IS ALL THAT IS

02:47:04.748 --> 02:47:06.149
HAPPENING HERE. WE HAVE A

02:47:06.216 --> 02:47:09.018
DIFFERENT IDEA ON HOW TO RESPOND

02:47:09.085 --> 02:47:12.722
TO AUTOCRATS WHO WANT TO

02:47:12.789 --> 02:47:15.392
BASICALLY CONTROL THIS COUNTRY

02:47:15.458 --> 02:47:19.062
IN AN UNFAIR WAY BY

02:47:19.129 --> 02:47:21.564
REDISTRICTING, IN A WAY THAT

02:47:21.631 --> 02:47:23.199
COMPLETELY AVOIDS VOTER INPUT.

02:47:23.266 --> 02:47:24.801
AND THAT'S WHAT TEXAS IS DOING,

02:47:24.868 --> 02:47:28.004
AND THAT'S WHY CALIFORNIA IS

02:47:28.071 --> 02:47:30.907
RESPONDING. SO DON'T SIT HERE.

02:47:30.974 --> 02:47:34.711
AND PLAY GAMES WHEN ON APRIL

02:47:34.778 --> 02:47:38.181
9TH, 2025, WHEN AB 1441 WAS

02:47:38.248 --> 02:47:41.751
BEFORE YOU BY SORIA, WHICH

02:47:41.818 --> 02:47:43.319
DIRECTED THE COUNTY OF MERCED TO

02:47:43.386 --> 02:47:44.687
ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT

02:47:44.754 --> 02:47:45.622
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

02:47:45.688 --> 02:47:47.190
COMMISSION TO ENSURE FAIRLY

02:47:47.257 --> 02:47:48.258
DRAWN DISTRICTS THAT TAKE INTO

02:47:48.324 --> 02:47:49.659
ACCOUNT DEMOGRAPHICS AND

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:50.760
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST. WHEN

02:47:50.827 --> 02:47:52.929
THE REPUBLICANS ON THIS

02:47:52.996 --> 02:47:55.799
COMMITTEE VOTED NO. SO DON'T SIT

02:47:55.865 --> 02:47:57.634
HERE AND PLAY GAMES. WE KNOW

02:47:57.700 --> 02:48:00.103
WHAT'S AT STAKE. DON'T INTERRUPT

02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:01.871
ME, MADAM CHAIR. DO NOT

02:48:01.938 --> 02:48:04.174
INTERRUPT. NO, SHE IS SPEAKING.

02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:06.910
WE ARE LETTING HER SPEAK. WE ARE

02:48:06.976 --> 02:48:09.612
LETTING HER SPEAK. I AM SPEAKING

02:48:09.679 --> 02:48:11.714
NOW. I HAVE NOT SPOKEN YET. TWO.

02:48:11.781 --> 02:48:13.049
POINT OF ORDER. INTERRUPT ME.

02:48:13.116 --> 02:48:14.884
POINT OF ORDER! DO NOT INTERRUPT

02:48:14.951 --> 02:48:18.822
ME. I POINT OF POINT OF ORDER.

02:48:18.888 --> 02:48:22.192
THIS IS THE DEMOCRATS RESPONSE

02:48:22.258 --> 02:48:23.827
TO WHAT IS HAPPENING. YOU STATED

02:48:23.893 --> 02:48:25.695
TO ME THAT I HAD TO REMAIN ON

02:48:25.762 --> 02:48:28.164
THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AT WHAT

02:48:28.231 --> 02:48:30.400
MIGHT HAPPEN IN MISSOURI. IT'S A

02:48:30.467 --> 02:48:32.068
BLATANT ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE

02:48:32.135 --> 02:48:33.503
ELECTIONS. THIS IS CALIFORNIA'S

02:48:33.570 --> 02:48:36.072
RESPONSE. WE HAVE COME UP WITH A

02:48:36.139 --> 02:48:37.574
WAY TO RESPOND, AND THIS IS THE

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:38.775
BILL THAT WE ARE PRESENTING

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:41.044
TODAY. YOU PLAY STUPID GAMES,

02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:42.612
YOU GET STUPID PRIZES. POINT OF

02:48:42.679 --> 02:48:43.847
ORDER. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE

02:48:43.913 --> 02:48:46.249
DOING. WHAT IS YOUR POINT OF

02:48:46.316 --> 02:48:47.684
ORDER? I WAS CONSTANTLY REMINDED

02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:48.852
TO REMAIN TO THE PERTINENCE OF

02:48:48.918 --> 02:48:50.920
THE BILL. WHAT DOES THAT BILL IN

02:48:50.987 --> 02:48:51.955
MERCED HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

02:48:52.021 --> 02:48:53.890
THIS ONE? AND THEN I WAS

02:48:53.957 --> 02:48:54.591
CONSTANTLY REMINDED WHENEVER I

02:48:54.657 --> 02:48:56.192
BROUGHT UP TEXAS TO REMAIN TO

02:48:56.259 --> 02:48:57.927
THE PERTINENCE OF THE BILL. SO I

02:48:57.994 --> 02:48:59.596
WOULD ASK THE SAME, PLEASE.

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:00.897
THANK YOU. YOUR POINT OF ORDER

02:49:00.964 --> 02:49:02.031
WAS NOT WELL TAKEN. ASSEMBLY

02:49:02.098 --> 02:49:03.566
MEMBER STEPHANIE, DO YOU HAVE

02:49:03.633 --> 02:49:04.534
ANY OTHER COMMENTS? I SUPPORT

02:49:04.601 --> 02:49:06.736
THIS BILL AND I URGE ANYONE THAT

02:49:06.803 --> 02:49:07.770
CARES ABOUT DEMOCRACY TO SUPPORT

02:49:07.837 --> 02:49:10.673
IT AS WELL. IS THAT A MOTION? WE

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:12.809
MOVE THE BILL. OKAY. WE HAVE A

02:49:12.876 --> 02:49:15.311
MOTION AND A SECOND ON THE BILL.

WE ARE TRYING TO WRAP UP THE

02:49:16.913 --> 02:49:18.548

02:49:21.851 --> 02:49:26.956
QUESTION. CAN I USE THE POSTER

BOARDS THAT I BROUGHT? WE HAVE

02:49:34.130 --> 02:49:35.565
NOT GOTTEN APPROVAL FOR ANY

02:49:35.632 --> 02:49:37.700
PROPS, SO. SO NO ASKING FOR

BOARDS. THEY'RE GREAT. I'LL SHOW

02:49:43.072 --> 02:49:44.507
YOU AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE

02:49:44.574 --> 02:49:45.875
AFTER CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS

02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:46.976
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WAS

02:49:47.043 --> 02:49:48.645
BORN, OUT OF VOTER FRUSTRATION

02:49:48.711 --> 02:49:50.179
WITH POLITICIANS GAMING THE

02:49:50.246 --> 02:49:52.749
SYSTEM FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT,

02:49:52.815 --> 02:49:54.117
TWICE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

02:49:54.183 --> 02:49:55.685
VOTED TO TAKE THE POWER OF

02:49:55.752 --> 02:49:57.453
DRAWING DISTRICT LINES AWAY FROM

02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:58.988
THE LEGISLATURE AND GIVE IT TO

02:49:59.055 --> 02:50:00.957
AN INDEPENDENT BODY THAT

02:50:01.024 --> 02:50:03.226
OPERATES WITH FULL TRANSPARENCY,

02:50:03.293 --> 02:50:05.061
OPEN HEARINGS AND STRICT RULES,

02:50:05.128 --> 02:50:06.462
AS WE HAVE HEARD TO PREVENT

02:50:06.529 --> 02:50:08.331
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERING. THIS

02:50:08.398 --> 02:50:10.767
REFORM WAS NOT HANDED DOWN BY

02:50:10.833 --> 02:50:12.135
POLITICIANS. IT WAS DEMANDED AND

02:50:12.201 --> 02:50:14.704
APPROVED BY VOTERS. WE ARE

02:50:14.771 --> 02:50:16.539
DISMISSING THE WILL OF THOSE

02:50:16.606 --> 02:50:18.608
VOTERS NOW. GAVIN GAVIN,

02:50:18.675 --> 02:50:20.810
GOVERNOR NEWSOM, DEMOCRAT PARTY

02:50:20.877 --> 02:50:22.979
BOSSES AND DEMOCRAT LAWMAKERS

02:50:23.046 --> 02:50:24.881
WANT TO TAKE THE POWER AWAY FROM

02:50:24.948 --> 02:50:26.182
THE VOTERS. THREE MEASURES AK

02:50:26.249 --> 02:50:29.419
EIGHT, SB 280 AND AB 604

02:50:29.485 --> 02:50:31.220
REPRESENT A COORDINATED EFFORT

02:50:31.287 --> 02:50:33.089
TO TEAR DOWN INDEPENDENT

02:50:33.156 --> 02:50:33.790
REDISTRICTING AND HAND POWER

02:50:33.856 --> 02:50:35.525
BACK TO THE VERY POLITICIANS

02:50:35.592 --> 02:50:37.760
VOTERS EXPLICITLY REJECTED. IT

02:50:37.827 --> 02:50:39.228
IS A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO

02:50:39.295 --> 02:50:40.330
GERRYMANDER CONGRESSIONAL

02:50:40.396 --> 02:50:42.031
DISTRICTS FOR PARTIZAN GAIN.

02:50:42.098 --> 02:50:43.499
EVEN WORSE, IT WOULD FORCE

02:50:43.566 --> 02:50:44.968
TAXPAYERS TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF

02:50:45.034 --> 02:50:47.036
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON A RUSHED,

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:48.871
CONFUSING SPECIAL ELECTION AT A

02:50:48.938 --> 02:50:51.374
TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY

02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:53.109
FACING SEVERE BUDGET SHORTFALLS

02:50:53.176 --> 02:50:54.544
AND DEEP CUTS TO ESSENTIAL

02:50:54.611 --> 02:50:57.447
SERVICES LIKE EDUCATION, PUBLIC

02:50:57.513 --> 02:51:00.783
SAFETY AND HEALTHCARE THAT I

02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:04.487
HAVE QUESTIONS. SO ACA EIGHT

02:51:04.554 --> 02:51:06.923
CUTS DIRECTLY AGAINST THE HEART

02:51:06.990 --> 02:51:09.058
OF CALIFORNIA'S DEMOCRATIC

02:51:09.125 --> 02:51:09.892
REFORMS. VOTERS TWICE WENT TO

02:51:09.959 --> 02:51:11.461
THE BALLOT BOX TO TAKE

02:51:11.527 --> 02:51:13.196
REDISTRICTING POWER AWAY. SO

02:51:13.262 --> 02:51:15.632
HERE ARE MY QUESTIONS. VOTERS

02:51:15.698 --> 02:51:17.000
ENSHRINED INDEPENDENT

02:51:17.066 --> 02:51:18.134
REDISTRICTING IN THE

02:51:18.201 --> 02:51:19.535
CONSTITUTION TO PREVENT

02:51:19.602 --> 02:51:20.937
POLITICIANS FROM RIGGING THE

02:51:21.004 --> 02:51:23.339
SYSTEM. HOW DOES ACA COMPLY WITH

02:51:23.406 --> 02:51:25.241
THE CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON

02:51:25.308 --> 02:51:26.676
FAVORING OR DISCRIMINATING

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:29.212
AGAINST A POLITICAL PARTY? AND

02:51:29.278 --> 02:51:31.714
REALLY QUICKLY, MR. BERMAN, WHO

02:51:31.781 --> 02:51:34.917
IS YOUR CLIENT, SIR? LET'S STICK

02:51:34.984 --> 02:51:36.753
TO THE QUESTION. ATTORNEY CLIENT

02:51:36.819 --> 02:51:38.287
PRIVILEGE. SO THAT'S PERTINENT.

02:51:38.354 --> 02:51:40.056
I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHO

02:51:40.123 --> 02:51:41.758
MY CLIENT IS. I'M JUST I'M JUST

02:51:41.824 --> 02:51:43.059
HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE

02:51:43.126 --> 02:51:44.694
OF THE BILL. OKAY. ASSEMBLY

02:51:44.761 --> 02:51:45.828
MEMBER BERMAN, PLEASE ANSWER THE

02:51:45.895 --> 02:51:49.132
QUESTION. SO GOING BACK SO THE

02:51:49.198 --> 02:51:50.199
QUESTION WAS, HOW DOES THE

02:51:50.266 --> 02:51:51.901
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AMEND

02:51:51.968 --> 02:51:54.871
THE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW THIS

02:51:54.937 --> 02:51:56.239
TO HAPPEN? SO THERE'S A

02:51:56.305 --> 02:51:57.473
CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON FAVORING

02:51:57.540 --> 02:51:59.175
OR DISCRIMINATING AGAINST A

02:51:59.242 --> 02:52:00.510
POLITICAL PARTY. AND THIS IS A

02:52:00.576 --> 02:52:02.345
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. WHAT

02:52:02.412 --> 02:52:05.481
LANGUAGE IN THIS IS SAYING THAT

02:52:05.548 --> 02:52:07.483
YOU ARE REVERSING THAT

02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:09.519
SPECIFICALLY. WELL, THE BILL

02:52:09.585 --> 02:52:10.720
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER

02:52:10.787 --> 02:52:12.055
PROVISION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.

02:52:12.121 --> 02:52:14.323
SO ANY CRITERIA THAT CURRENTLY

02:52:14.390 --> 02:52:15.258
EXISTS IN THE CONSTITUTION

02:52:15.324 --> 02:52:16.859
REGARDING REDISTRICTING ARE

02:52:16.926 --> 02:52:18.695
SUSPENDED FOR PURPOSES OF THIS

02:52:18.761 --> 02:52:20.029
REDISTRICTING. I UNDERSTAND, BUT

02:52:20.096 --> 02:52:21.864
WHAT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE, LEGAL

02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:23.666
LANGUAGE, DID YOU PUT IN THERE

02:52:23.733 --> 02:52:25.068
SAYING THAT WE ARE NOW CHANGING,

02:52:25.134 --> 02:52:26.903
THAT WE CAN NOW DISCRIMINATE

02:52:26.969 --> 02:52:28.037
AGAINST A POLITICAL PARTY? I

02:52:28.104 --> 02:52:29.806
THINK HE SAID THAT, BUT I'M

02:52:29.872 --> 02:52:31.140
GOING TO ASK HIM TO REPEAT IT.

02:52:31.207 --> 02:52:32.909
YEAH, YEAH. AGAIN, THE LANGUAGE

02:52:32.975 --> 02:52:34.477
IN THIS PROVISION,

02:52:34.544 --> 02:52:35.545
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER

02:52:35.611 --> 02:52:36.879
PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION,

02:52:36.946 --> 02:52:38.047
INCLUDING THE CRITERIA THAT

02:52:38.114 --> 02:52:40.349
YOU'RE IDENTIFYING. SO WE'RE

02:52:40.416 --> 02:52:41.017
THROWING THE CONSTITUTION IN THE

02:52:41.084 --> 02:52:42.752
TRASH AND STARTING ALL OVER. WHY

02:52:42.819 --> 02:52:43.853
YOUR QUESTIONS? YOUR QUESTIONS

02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:45.555
BEEN ANSWERED. VOTERS ARE ASKING

02:52:45.621 --> 02:52:47.490
CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS WHETHER OR

02:52:47.557 --> 02:52:49.592
NOT THEY WANT TO ADOPT THIS

02:52:49.659 --> 02:52:51.027
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT,

02:52:51.094 --> 02:52:51.661
NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT IS

02:52:51.728 --> 02:52:52.795
CURRENTLY IN THE CONSTITUTION.

02:52:52.862 --> 02:52:54.564
WE ARE NOT DOING THAT. THIS DOES

02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:56.499
NOT GO INTO EFFECT IF THE

02:52:56.566 --> 02:52:58.201
LEGISLATURE PASSES IT. 20

02:52:58.267 --> 02:53:00.403
MILLION CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE

02:53:00.470 --> 02:53:02.205
TO VOTE TO APPROVE THE

02:53:02.271 --> 02:53:03.039
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. THAT'S

02:53:03.106 --> 02:53:04.974
THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN

02:53:05.041 --> 02:53:06.743
CALIFORNIA. YEAH, I GOT THAT. SO

02:53:06.809 --> 02:53:08.377
WHY SHOULD LAWMAKERS OVERRIDE

02:53:08.444 --> 02:53:10.480
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

02:53:10.546 --> 02:53:12.582
TWICE TOLD US THAT THEY WANT TO

02:53:12.648 --> 02:53:14.150
KEEP THE REDISTRICTING IN THE

02:53:14.217 --> 02:53:15.818
HANDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE

02:53:15.885 --> 02:53:16.919
HERE TESTIFYING, THAT HAVE GIVEN

02:53:16.986 --> 02:53:18.054
WONDERFUL REASONS WHY I SHOULD

02:53:18.121 --> 02:53:20.123
STAY THERE. I APPRECIATE THE

02:53:20.189 --> 02:53:21.190
QUESTION, AND I THINK IT'S AN

02:53:21.257 --> 02:53:25.294
IMPORTANT ONE. WE ONCE AGAIN,

02:53:25.361 --> 02:53:27.430
ARE ASKING THE VOTERS WHETHER OR

02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:29.165
NOT THEY WANT TO APPROVE THIS

02:53:29.232 --> 02:53:30.900
CHANGE. SO THIS IS NOT THE

02:53:30.967 --> 02:53:32.401
LEGISLATURE APPROVING THIS

02:53:32.468 --> 02:53:34.237
CHANGE. THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE

02:53:34.303 --> 02:53:36.372
PUTTING ON THE BALLOT THE

02:53:36.439 --> 02:53:38.241
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA

02:53:38.307 --> 02:53:40.910
VOTER IN 2025, WHETHER OR NOT

02:53:40.977 --> 02:53:42.478
THIS IS A CHANGE THAT THEY

02:53:42.545 --> 02:53:43.946
APPROVE. AND I KNOW IT WAS

02:53:44.013 --> 02:53:45.381
JOKINGLY MENTIONED EARLIER THAT

02:53:45.448 --> 02:53:46.816
MY, MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND

02:53:46.883 --> 02:53:48.584
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS NOT ABLE TO

02:53:48.651 --> 02:53:51.487
VOTE ON THE ORIGINAL

02:53:51.554 --> 02:53:52.588
REDISTRICTING. I DON'T THINK

02:53:52.655 --> 02:53:55.057
THAT'S A JOKE. I THINK IT'S A

02:53:55.124 --> 02:53:55.792
VERY IMPORTANT POINT. AND THE

02:53:55.858 --> 02:53:58.327
POINT IS THAT SINCE 2010, AN

02:53:58.394 --> 02:54:00.897
ESTIMATED 3.6 MILLION CALIFORNIA

02:54:00.963 --> 02:54:02.999
VOTERS HAVE DIED AND THERE ARE 6

02:54:03.065 --> 02:54:05.168
MILLION MORE CALIFORNIA

02:54:05.234 --> 02:54:06.969
CALIFORNIANS REGISTERED TO VOTE

02:54:07.036 --> 02:54:08.738
NOW THAN IN 2010, INCLUDING TWO

02:54:08.805 --> 02:54:11.274
VERY IMPORTANT VOICES IN

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:13.709
CALIFORNIA YOU TWO VICE CHAIR

02:54:13.776 --> 02:54:15.278
MACEDO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:54:15.344 --> 02:54:18.047
TANGPA. YOU DID NOT HAVE A VOICE

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:20.716
IN THAT DECISION. OVER HALF OF

02:54:20.783 --> 02:54:21.751
REGISTERED VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA

02:54:21.818 --> 02:54:23.853
DID NOT HAVE A VOICE IN THAT

02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:25.254
DECISION. AND SO WHAT WE ARE

02:54:25.321 --> 02:54:28.057
SAYING IS, LET'S GIVE CALIFORNIA

02:54:28.124 --> 02:54:31.093
VOTERS IN 2025, HALF OF WHICH

02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:32.528
WEREN'T EVEN REGISTERED VOTERS

02:54:32.595 --> 02:54:34.997
IN 2010, A CHANCE TO HAVE THEIR

02:54:35.064 --> 02:54:36.799
VOICE BE HEARD. AND I CAN THINK

02:54:36.866 --> 02:54:38.234
OF NOTHING MORE DEMOCRATIC THAN

02:54:38.301 --> 02:54:40.503
DOING THAT. SO THEN WHY NOT A

02:54:40.570 --> 02:54:42.738
CENSUS TO SEE WHO WE HAVE IN

02:54:42.805 --> 02:54:44.106
CALIFORNIA? WHO'S REGISTERED? WE

02:54:44.173 --> 02:54:45.875
DID A CENSUS, I BELIEVE, FOUR

02:54:45.942 --> 02:54:47.643
YEARS AGO. YES. THANK YOU, THANK

02:54:47.710 --> 02:54:49.412
YOU. ALL RIGHT. WE'VE WE'VE

02:54:49.478 --> 02:54:50.847
DELIBERATED ON THIS MEASURE.

02:54:50.913 --> 02:54:52.481
OTHER MEMBERS, PLENTY OF TIME TO

02:54:52.548 --> 02:54:54.917
SPEAK, PLEASE. HOW MANY MORE

02:54:54.984 --> 02:54:56.252
QUESTIONS? OKAY. WHAT OTHER

02:54:56.319 --> 02:54:57.720
QUESTION DO YOU HAVE, MADAM

02:54:57.787 --> 02:54:58.921
CHAIR? I HAVE SOME MORE

02:54:58.988 --> 02:55:00.690
QUESTIONS AS WELL. WE ARE WE ARE

02:55:00.756 --> 02:55:01.724
DONE WITH THE QUESTIONS. WE'RE

02:55:01.791 --> 02:55:04.493
GOING TO TRY TO WRAP THIS UP AND

02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:06.062
PUT THIS TO A VOTE. BUT, MACEDO,

02:55:06.128 --> 02:55:07.763
PLEASE ASK YOUR FINAL QUESTION.

02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:13.269
MY FINAL QUESTION, MADAM CHAIR.

02:55:13.336 --> 02:55:15.771
I CAME PREPARED AFTER YOU GAVE

02:55:15.838 --> 02:55:17.974
ME 24 HOURS. ALL I'M ASKING FOR

02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:19.809
IS A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. YOU LET

02:55:19.876 --> 02:55:21.143
MR. BERMAN SPEAK TWICE. WOULD

02:55:21.210 --> 02:55:22.945
YOU LIKE TO ASK YOUR QUESTION,

02:55:23.012 --> 02:55:25.214
OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO NOT. WOULD

02:55:25.281 --> 02:55:27.049
YOU LIKE TO ASK YOUR QUESTION? I

02:55:27.116 --> 02:55:27.917
WOULD I WILL ABSOLUTELY ASK MY

02:55:27.984 --> 02:55:29.752
QUESTION. I'M SURE THESE WILL BE

02:55:29.819 --> 02:55:31.220
ASKED IN A COURTROOM. BUT THIS

02:55:31.287 --> 02:55:32.355
IS RIDICULOUS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM

02:55:32.421 --> 02:55:33.623
HIMSELF SAID THIS PROPOSAL IS

02:55:33.689 --> 02:55:36.158
ABOUT ELECTING MORE DEMOCRATS.

02:55:36.225 --> 02:55:38.160
ISN'T THAT THE VERY DEFINITION

02:55:38.227 --> 02:55:39.795
OF PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERING

02:55:39.862 --> 02:55:41.931
VOTERS SOUGHT TO PREVENT? WE ARE

02:55:41.998 --> 02:55:43.733
ASKING VOTERS WHETHER OR NOT

02:55:43.799 --> 02:55:46.235
THEY WANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT

02:55:46.302 --> 02:55:50.006
CRITERIA USED IN DETERMINING THE

02:55:50.072 --> 02:55:50.973
CONGRESSIONAL MAPS, AND IT'LL BE

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:52.875
UP TO VOTERS AS TO WHETHER OR

02:55:52.942 --> 02:55:54.844
NOT THEY WANT TO SAY YES OR NO.

PROVIDES A GREATER PUBLIC HEALTH

02:57:01.811 --> 02:57:04.213

ROLL. I CARE ABOUT THE STATE OF

02:59:52.681 --> 02:59:54.049
CALIFORNIA, AND I THINK THAT WE

02:59:54.116 --> 02:59:55.651

02:59:55.718 --> 02:59:57.753

03:00:46.702 --> 03:00:48.470
IS THAT NOT MY TURN TO SPEAK FOR

03:00:48.537 --> 03:00:50.773

OF THIS YEAR. THE SPECIAL

03:55:26.245 --> 03:55:28.247

THE SPECIAL ELECTION. THE BILL

03:56:07.019 --> 03:56:09.088

03:56:18.430 --> 03:56:20.266
CALIFORNIA DID NOT START THIS

03:56:20.332 --> 03:56:23.502
FIGHT. THIS FIGHT CAME TO US. WE

03:56:23.569 --> 03:56:26.205
ARE HERE BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP

03:56:26.272 --> 03:56:29.141

CONGRESS KNOW THAT THEIR AGENDA

03:56:31.243 --> 03:56:33.779
IS DEEPLY UNPOPULAR, AND THEY

03:56:33.846 --> 03:56:36.315
SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL.

03:56:36.382 --> 03:56:38.083
THEY KNOW THAT THE MASS

03:56:54.500 --> 03:56:56.936
CUTS THEY JAMMED THROUGH

03:56:57.002 --> 03:56:58.771
CONGRESS THAT STRIP HEALTH CARE

03:56:58.837 --> 03:57:01.473
AWAY FROM MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.

03:57:01.540 --> 03:57:03.776
AND THEY KNOW THAT GIVING TAX

03:57:03.842 --> 03:57:06.478
CUTS TO BILLIONAIRES WHILE TRUMP

03:57:06.545 --> 03:57:08.347
IMPOSES TARIFF TAXES ON

03:57:08.414 --> 03:57:10.616
ESSENTIAL GOODS SUCH AS COFFEE

03:57:10.683 --> 03:57:13.953
AND BANANAS, WILL CONTINUE TO

03:57:14.019 --> 03:57:16.455
RAISE THE COST OF LIVING FOR

03:57:16.522 --> 03:57:19.124
EVERYDAY WORKING FAMILIES. WHAT

03:57:19.191 --> 03:57:21.393
TRUMP KNOWS IS THAT THE ONLY

03:57:21.460 --> 03:57:24.597
PATH FOR REPUBLICANS TO HOLD ON

03:57:24.663 --> 03:57:27.132
TO THE HOUSE IN THE MIDTERMS IS

03:57:27.199 --> 03:57:28.367
TO CHANGE THE RULES IN THE

03:57:28.434 --> 03:57:30.436
MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THAT IS WHY

03:57:30.502 --> 03:57:32.838
IN TEXAS AND IN OTHER RED

03:57:32.905 --> 03:57:34.740
STATES, REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS

03:57:34.807 --> 03:57:37.610
ARE PREPARING TO REDRAW THEIR

REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS GET TO

CHOOSE THEIR VOTERS AGAIN.

03:57:44.416 --> 03:57:45.584
REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS GET TO

03:57:45.651 --> 03:57:47.720
CHOOSE THEIR VOTERS INSTEAD OF

03:57:47.786 --> 03:57:49.154
LETTING VOTERS CHOOSE THEIR

03:57:49.221 --> 03:57:52.358

03:57:52.424 --> 03:57:55.361
SILENCE THE VOICES OF LATINO

03:57:55.427 --> 03:57:58.797

03:58:02.501 --> 03:58:04.269
WANTS TO CHANGE THE RULES OF THE

03:58:04.336 --> 03:58:07.039
GAME IN THE FIFTH INNING SO THAT

03:58:07.106 --> 03:58:08.173
REPUBLICANS GET FOUR STRIKES,

03:58:08.240 --> 03:58:11.143
WHILE DEMOCRATS GET THREE. THEIR

03:58:11.210 --> 03:58:13.879
GOAL IS SIMPLE TO RIG

03:58:13.946 --> 03:58:15.781
CONGRESSIONAL MAPS AND

03:58:15.848 --> 03:58:17.116
REPUBLICAN STATES ACROSS OUR

03:58:17.182 --> 03:58:19.385
COUNTRY TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE

03:58:19.451 --> 03:58:20.819
FOR DEMOCRATS TO RETAKE CONTROL

03:58:20.886 --> 03:58:22.421
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

03:58:22.488 --> 03:58:26.525
IN 2026. CALIFORNIA CANNOT STAND

03:58:26.592 --> 03:58:30.396
BY WHILE DONALD TRUMP DISMANTLES

03:58:30.462 --> 03:58:33.098
OUR DEMOCRACY PIECE BY PIECE, WE

03:58:33.165 --> 03:58:35.668
WILL NOT LET HIM DETERMINE THE

03:58:35.734 --> 03:58:37.670
OUTCOME OF FUTURE ELECTIONS

03:58:37.736 --> 03:58:40.205
YEARS IN ADVANCE. BEFORE ANY

03:58:40.272 --> 03:58:43.442
VOTE IS CAST TO PROP UP HIS

03:58:43.509 --> 03:58:45.678
AUTHORITARIAN PRESIDENCY. AND IF

03:58:45.744 --> 03:58:47.246
YOU DOUBT THAT TRUMP IS TRYING

03:58:47.312 --> 03:58:49.748
TO BECOME A DICTATOR, REMEMBER

03:58:49.815 --> 03:58:52.117
THAT HE SENT ARMED FEDERAL

03:58:52.184 --> 03:58:54.219
AGENTS TO HARASS THE PEACEFUL

03:58:54.286 --> 03:58:56.422
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT TOOK PLACE

03:58:56.488 --> 03:58:59.258
LAST WEEK IN LA WITH GOVERNOR

03:58:59.324 --> 03:59:02.227
NEWSOM? THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER

03:59:02.294 --> 03:59:04.329
IS, IF WE LET DONALD TRUMP GET

03:59:04.396 --> 03:59:06.098
AWAY WITH THIS RIGGING OF

03:59:06.165 --> 03:59:07.299
ELECTIONS THROUGH

03:59:07.366 --> 03:59:08.634
GERRYMANDERING, PARTIZAN,

03:59:08.701 --> 03:59:09.935
GERRYMANDERING, WE MAY NOT HAVE

03:59:10.002 --> 03:59:12.171
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN THE

03:59:12.237 --> 03:59:16.608
UNITED STATES IN THE FUTURE. IF

03:59:16.675 --> 03:59:19.378
DONALD TRUMP PURSUES THIS

03:59:19.445 --> 03:59:23.082
PARTIZAN POWER GRAB, THEN

03:59:23.148 --> 03:59:26.251
CALIFORNIA IS READY TO RESPOND.

03:59:26.318 --> 03:59:28.754
OUR PLAN WILL ONLY GO INTO

03:59:28.821 --> 03:59:36.095
EFFECT IF TEXAS AND OTHER STATES

03:59:36.161 --> 03:59:39.965
MOVE TO REDRAW THEIR LINES.

03:59:40.032 --> 03:59:42.601
AGAIN. OUR PLAN WILL ONLY GO TO

03:59:42.668 --> 03:59:44.336
EFFECT IF TEXAS AND OTHER RED

03:59:44.403 --> 03:59:46.805
STATES MOVE TO REDRAW THEIR

03:59:46.872 --> 03:59:49.641
LINES. TRUMP CAN DO THE RIGHT

03:59:49.708 --> 03:59:52.845
THING TODAY AND STAND DOWN AND

03:59:52.911 --> 03:59:55.114
NOT MOVE FORWARD. IN REDRAWING

03:59:55.180 --> 03:59:56.215
CONGRESSIONAL MAPS AND

03:59:56.281 --> 03:59:58.751
REPUBLICAN STATES IN

03:59:58.817 --> 04:00:00.452
CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT DISTRICTS

04:00:00.519 --> 04:00:03.822
WILL REMAIN IN PLACE.

04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:05.491
ULTIMATELY, THIS IS OUR

04:00:05.557 --> 04:00:07.259
PREFERRED OUTCOME BECAUSE WE DO

04:00:07.326 --> 04:00:08.393
VALUE THE CALIFORNIA'S

04:00:08.460 --> 04:00:09.762
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

04:00:09.828 --> 04:00:11.396
COMMISSION, WHICH IS THE GOLD

04:00:11.463 --> 04:00:13.398
STANDARD OF OUR COUNTRY. AND

04:00:13.465 --> 04:00:17.336
THIS CRISIS SHOWS THAT WE NEED

04:00:17.402 --> 04:00:21.406
TO ENACT A NATIONWIDE CITIZENS

04:00:21.473 --> 04:00:24.910
NONPARTIZAN COMMISSION. IF EVERY

04:00:24.977 --> 04:00:27.412
STATE FOLLOWED CALIFORNIA'S LEAD

04:00:27.479 --> 04:00:29.681
AND ADOPTED THESE INDEPENDENT

04:00:29.748 --> 04:00:32.217
REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS, OR IF

04:00:32.284 --> 04:00:35.654
CONGRESS REQUIRED THIS, WE

04:00:35.721 --> 04:00:37.556
WOULDN'T BE IN THIS CRISIS TO

04:00:37.623 --> 04:00:40.159
BEGIN WITH. GERRYMANDERING WOULD

04:00:40.225 --> 04:00:42.494
BE A THING OF THE PAST. FINALLY,

04:00:42.561 --> 04:00:44.363
I WANT TO ADDRESS REPUBLICAN

04:00:44.429 --> 04:00:46.865
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM

04:00:46.932 --> 04:00:49.835
CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE THE POWER

04:00:49.902 --> 04:00:52.404
TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING. THE

04:00:52.471 --> 04:00:55.808
POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS. I APPEAL

04:00:55.874 --> 04:00:57.376
TO YOUR BETTER ANGELS. BUT IF

04:00:57.442 --> 04:01:00.212
YOU REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THOSE

04:01:00.279 --> 04:01:02.014
ANGLES, I WILL RELY ON YOUR

04:01:02.080 --> 04:01:03.715
AMBITION, YOUR SELF-INTEREST,

04:01:03.782 --> 04:01:05.717
AND YOUR DESIRE TO KEEP YOUR

04:01:05.784 --> 04:01:08.187
HOUSE SEATS AND YOUR PAYCHECK.

04:01:08.253 --> 04:01:09.721
YOU CAN ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP TO

04:01:09.788 --> 04:01:12.791
END THIS NOW. YOU CAN TELL HIM

04:01:12.858 --> 04:01:14.660
TO CALL OFF THESE PARTIZAN

04:01:14.726 --> 04:01:16.328
GERRYMANDERING IN TEXAS AND

04:01:16.395 --> 04:01:18.697
OTHER STATES. BUT IF TRUMP

04:01:18.764 --> 04:01:20.165
DECIDES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH HIS

04:01:20.232 --> 04:01:22.067
PLAN TO STEAL DEMOCRATIC SEATS,

04:01:22.134 --> 04:01:23.535
THEN CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE

04:01:23.602 --> 04:01:27.239
FIREWALL. WE HAVE DEFEATED

04:01:27.306 --> 04:01:29.741
AUTHORITARIANISM BEFORE, AND WE

04:01:29.808 --> 04:01:32.711
WILL DEFEAT IT AGAIN. BUT AT THE

04:01:32.778 --> 04:01:35.547
BALLOT BOX WITH THE VOTERS IN

04:01:35.614 --> 04:01:38.050
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAKING

04:01:38.116 --> 04:01:42.354
THE ULTIMATE DECISION. ON

04:01:42.421 --> 04:01:45.557
NOVEMBER 4TH, 2025. TODAY WE

04:01:45.624 --> 04:01:49.895
HAVE TWO WITNESSES TESTIFYING IN

04:01:49.962 --> 04:01:51.396
SUPPORT. I'LL ALLOW THEM TO

04:01:51.463 --> 04:01:53.765
SELF-IDENTIFY. AND YOU EACH HAVE

04:01:53.832 --> 04:01:57.202
THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU. THANK

04:01:57.269 --> 04:01:58.604
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU.

04:01:58.670 --> 04:02:00.672
MEMBERS I AM JODIE HICKS, THE

04:02:00.739 --> 04:02:02.507
CEO AND PRESIDENT OF PLANNED

04:02:02.574 --> 04:02:03.909
PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF

04:02:03.976 --> 04:02:06.845
CALIFORNIA HERE REPRESENTING ALL

04:02:06.912 --> 04:02:08.914
SEVEN AFFILIATES AND OVER 100

04:02:08.981 --> 04:02:10.382
HEALTH CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE

04:02:10.449 --> 04:02:12.317
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M

04:02:12.384 --> 04:02:15.487
HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT TO THIS

04:02:15.554 --> 04:02:17.623
MEASURE AND TO CALIFORNIA'S

04:02:17.689 --> 04:02:20.893
RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, TO

04:02:20.959 --> 04:02:23.395
TEXAS REPUBLICANS, TO ANY STATE

04:02:23.462 --> 04:02:26.999
THAT'S PLANNING TO GAME THE 2026

04:02:27.065 --> 04:02:28.967
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. AND I JUST

04:02:29.034 --> 04:02:30.602
WANT TO POINT OUT WHY I KNOW

04:02:30.669 --> 04:02:32.104
THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY HEARD

04:02:32.170 --> 04:02:34.139
A LOT ABOUT THE COMMISSION. I'M

04:02:34.206 --> 04:02:36.408
SURE THERE'LL BE MORE

04:02:36.475 --> 04:02:37.809
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. WHAT I

04:02:37.876 --> 04:02:40.312
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE IMPACT

04:02:40.379 --> 04:02:42.581
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

04:02:42.648 --> 04:02:44.249
CALIFORNIANS, TO CALIFORNIA

04:02:44.316 --> 04:02:48.353
VALUES WITH H.R. ONE THAT JUST

04:02:48.420 --> 04:02:53.392
PASSED CALIFORNIA, OVER 3.5

04:02:53.458 --> 04:02:55.127
MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT

04:02:55.193 --> 04:02:58.397
HEALTH CARE. PLANNED PARENTHOOD

04:02:58.463 --> 04:03:01.566
WAS EFFECTIVELY DEFUNDED IN THAT

04:03:01.633 --> 04:03:04.102
BILL. FOR ALL OF THE SERVICES

04:03:04.169 --> 04:03:05.237
THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD

04:03:05.304 --> 04:03:06.905
PROVIDES, WHETHER THAT'S CANCER

04:03:06.972 --> 04:03:08.774
SCREENINGS OR BIRTH CONTROL OR

04:03:08.840 --> 04:03:11.910
EVEN PRENATAL CARE, STRIPPED ALL

04:03:11.977 --> 04:03:13.812
OF THE FUNDING FROM PLANNED

04:03:13.879 --> 04:03:15.981
PARENTHOOD IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY

04:03:16.048 --> 04:03:17.849
AND REDUCE ACCESS TO

04:03:17.916 --> 04:03:18.684
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IN THE

04:03:18.750 --> 04:03:20.519
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, DESPITE THE

04:03:20.585 --> 04:03:24.323
FACT THAT 67% OF CALIFORNIANS

04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:27.025
VOTED TO ENSURE THAT IN OUR

04:03:27.092 --> 04:03:28.927
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION,

04:03:28.994 --> 04:03:30.762
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO

04:03:30.829 --> 04:03:32.531
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. SO OUR

04:03:32.597 --> 04:03:35.467
INTENT IS TO GO UP AND DOWN THE

04:03:35.534 --> 04:03:37.202
STATE AND TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT

04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:39.671
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN H.R. ONE,

04:03:39.738 --> 04:03:42.207
AND WHAT WE KNOW IS WHEN

04:03:42.274 --> 04:03:44.643
CALIFORNIANS UNDERSTAND THAT

04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:46.912
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, WHEN

04:03:46.979 --> 04:03:49.114
THEY'RE VERY VALUES, ARE AT

04:03:49.181 --> 04:03:50.949
STAKE, THEY WILL RESPOND AND

04:03:51.016 --> 04:03:53.185
THEY WILL HOLD MEMBERS

04:03:53.251 --> 04:03:54.820
ACCOUNTABLE. BUT THAT CAN'T

04:03:54.886 --> 04:03:57.055
HAPPEN IF ANOTHER STATE IS

04:03:57.122 --> 04:03:58.857
RIGGING THE ELECTION BEFORE

04:03:58.924 --> 04:04:02.794
THOSE VOTES EVEN OCCUR. YOU

04:04:02.861 --> 04:04:05.330
KNOW, IF WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE

04:04:05.397 --> 04:04:09.167
OUR GOLD STANDARD ACROSS EVERY

04:04:09.234 --> 04:04:11.003
STATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

04:04:11.069 --> 04:04:14.740
OR IN THE COUNTRY OF THE UNITED

04:04:14.806 --> 04:04:16.575
STATES, WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING

04:04:16.641 --> 04:04:17.509
THIS CONVERSATION. WE'D BE

04:04:17.576 --> 04:04:19.044
TALKING TO VOTERS THE WAY THAT

04:04:19.111 --> 04:04:21.213
WE WANT TO, BUT THAT'S JUST NOT

04:04:21.279 --> 04:04:24.383
THE CASE. AND SENDING THIS TO

04:04:24.449 --> 04:04:27.019
THE VOTERS, LETTING THEM DECIDE

04:04:27.085 --> 04:04:29.087
HOW THEY WANT TO RESPOND TO WHAT

04:04:29.154 --> 04:04:31.423
ANOTHER STATE IS DOING TO TRY

04:04:31.490 --> 04:04:33.759
AND HOLD ON TO POWER. SO THERE'S

04:04:33.825 --> 04:04:36.294
NO WAY TO REACT TO WHAT IS

04:04:36.361 --> 04:04:37.796
AFFECTING THEIR VERY LIVES, TO

04:04:37.863 --> 04:04:39.398
WHAT IS AFFECTING THEIR

04:04:39.464 --> 04:04:40.966
HEALTHCARE, TO WHAT IS AFFECTING

04:04:41.033 --> 04:04:43.535
THE VERY VALUES OF CALIFORNIA.

04:04:43.602 --> 04:04:45.637
WE HAVE A GOLD STANDARD. WE ARE

04:04:45.704 --> 04:04:48.473
THE MODEL WITH OUR INDEPENDENT

04:04:48.540 --> 04:04:49.307
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. BUT

04:04:49.374 --> 04:04:50.742
GUESS WHAT? WE ARE THE MODEL FOR

04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:52.744
OUR VALUES HERE TOO. WE ARE A

04:04:52.811 --> 04:04:55.047
MODEL FOR HOW WE VALUE

04:04:55.113 --> 04:04:56.815
DIVERSITY, FOR HOW WE VALUE

04:04:56.882 --> 04:04:58.917
INCLUSIVITY, AND FOR HOW WE

04:04:58.984 --> 04:05:02.554
VALUE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE,

04:05:02.621 --> 04:05:04.456
INCLUDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

04:05:04.523 --> 04:05:05.791
CARE. AND WE ARE REPRODUCTIVE

04:05:05.857 --> 04:05:07.859
FREEDOM STATE AND VOTERS DESERVE

04:05:07.926 --> 04:05:10.162
TO VOTE ON THAT. THANK YOU. NEXT

04:05:10.228 --> 04:05:11.563
WITNESS. YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES

04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:13.365
OKAY. DANNY CURTIN, CALIFORNIA

04:05:13.432 --> 04:05:16.268
CONFERENCE OF CARPENTERS. THANK

04:05:16.334 --> 04:05:19.137
YOU. YOU'VE ALL HEARD FROM ME

04:05:19.204 --> 04:05:21.406
BEFORE NOT TOO LONG AGO, DANNY

04:05:21.473 --> 04:05:22.741
CURTIN WITH THE CARPENTERS

04:05:22.808 --> 04:05:25.310
UNION. I WANT TO REITERATE THAT

04:05:25.377 --> 04:05:26.711
WE DIDN'T COME HERE BECAUSE WE

04:05:26.778 --> 04:05:29.548
WERE JOYFULLY APPROACHING THIS

04:05:29.614 --> 04:05:31.149
PROBLEM. THERE'S NO QUESTION

04:05:31.216 --> 04:05:32.751
THAT THIS WAS TRIGGERED BY THE

04:05:32.818 --> 04:05:35.987
PRESIDENT, FOR REASONS THAT WE

04:05:36.054 --> 04:05:37.389
ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF

04:05:37.456 --> 04:05:38.957
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE

04:05:39.024 --> 04:05:40.325
PAST UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION,

04:05:40.392 --> 04:05:42.160
BUT ALSO THE IMPACTS OF WHAT

04:05:42.227 --> 04:05:44.396
HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE IS REALLY

04:05:44.463 --> 04:05:45.397
WHAT'S AT POINT. THE DISCUSSION

04:05:45.464 --> 04:05:48.033
POINT HERE, THE TARGETED ATTACKS

04:05:48.100 --> 04:05:49.901
ON CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE IS ONE

04:05:49.968 --> 04:05:51.603
OF THE MOST DISTURBING PORTIONS

04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:53.638
OF THIS FOR ME. WE ARE IN THE

04:05:53.705 --> 04:05:55.307
MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS THAT'S

04:05:55.373 --> 04:05:56.608
DIVIDING US LIKE NO OTHER

04:05:56.675 --> 04:05:58.376
CRISIS, AND WE HAVE PLENTY MORE

04:05:58.443 --> 04:05:59.544
TO THINK ABOUT WATER, ENERGY,

04:05:59.611 --> 04:06:02.280
YOU NAME IT. AND THAT HOUSING

04:06:02.347 --> 04:06:04.349
CRISIS IS PRIMARILY PRIVATE

04:06:04.416 --> 04:06:05.684
SECTOR HOUSING, WHICH IS NOT

04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:06.918
BEING PRODUCED AT THE RATE IT

04:06:06.985 --> 04:06:09.554
NEEDS TO BE PRODUCED. AND NOW WE

04:06:09.621 --> 04:06:12.757
HAVE ARMED BATTLE READY. I DON'T

04:06:12.824 --> 04:06:14.326
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. THEY'RE NOT

04:06:14.392 --> 04:06:15.660
IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES. IN SOME

04:06:15.727 --> 04:06:17.129
CASES, THEY'RE WEARING MASKS AND

04:06:17.195 --> 04:06:20.198
I CALL THEM RAMBO WANNABES,

04:06:20.265 --> 04:06:21.833
ATTACKING PEOPLE ON THE JOB

04:06:21.900 --> 04:06:23.235
SITES, GOING TO PLACES WHERE

04:06:23.301 --> 04:06:25.270
PEOPLE GO TO WORK AND THE

04:06:25.337 --> 04:06:26.905
INDUSTRY THAT'S GOING TO GET

04:06:26.972 --> 04:06:27.939
MOST IMPACTED BY THIS, AMONG

04:06:28.006 --> 04:06:29.641
OTHERS, IS CONSTRUCTION AND

04:06:29.708 --> 04:06:31.576
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. THAT IS

04:06:31.643 --> 04:06:33.945
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN TERMS OF

04:06:34.012 --> 04:06:35.814
WHAT'S DIVIDING CALIFORNIANS AND

04:06:35.881 --> 04:06:37.649
CAUSING PART OF THIS MASSIVE

04:06:37.716 --> 04:06:39.484
POLITICAL RIFT, NOT JUST

04:06:39.551 --> 04:06:41.486
HOUSING, BUT AG RESTAURANTS,

04:06:41.553 --> 04:06:42.988
HOSPITALITY. YOU KNOW, THE

04:06:43.054 --> 04:06:44.456
DIFFERENCES HERE. THE CUTS IN

04:06:44.523 --> 04:06:47.025
HEALTHCARE WERE WELL LAID OUT.

04:06:47.092 --> 04:06:49.261
THIS IS NOT INSUBSTANTIAL IN

04:06:49.327 --> 04:06:50.896
WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT WE'RE

04:06:50.962 --> 04:06:52.197
FIGHTING ABOUT. AND I WANT TO

04:06:52.264 --> 04:06:53.999
KEEP THE FOCUS ON WHAT WE'RE

04:06:54.065 --> 04:06:56.201
FIGHTING ABOUT, NOT THE SPECIFIC

04:06:56.268 --> 04:06:57.836
DETAILS. I BELIEVE ALL OF THIS

04:06:57.903 --> 04:06:58.904
IS DONE CONSTITUTIONALLY. WE

04:06:58.970 --> 04:07:00.839
HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE A WHACK

04:07:00.906 --> 04:07:03.542
AT THIS, GIVE IT TO THE VOTERS.

04:07:03.608 --> 04:07:05.710
OTHER STATES HAVE IT, TOO. BUT

04:07:05.777 --> 04:07:07.846
WE CAN'T SIT HERE AND JUST LET

04:07:07.913 --> 04:07:09.848
IT GO IN ONE DIRECTION BECAUSE

04:07:09.915 --> 04:07:10.649
IT'S POSSIBLE RAMIFICATIONS, 1

04:07:10.715 --> 04:07:13.885
OR 2 MORE LITTLE THINGS. SO FAR,

04:07:13.952 --> 04:07:16.087
THE CONGRESS, SENATE AND

04:07:16.154 --> 04:07:17.923
CONGRESS HAS BEEN RELATIVELY

04:07:17.989 --> 04:07:19.991
SUPINE IN REGARDS TO THE TRUMP

04:07:20.058 --> 04:07:22.928
AGENDA. NOW THEY WERE ELECTED

04:07:22.994 --> 04:07:25.530
AND THAT HAPPENS. AND A LOT OF

04:07:25.597 --> 04:07:27.566
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT AND A LOT

04:07:27.632 --> 04:07:29.100
OF PEOPLE LIKE IT. BUT IT'S THE

04:07:29.167 --> 04:07:30.202
NEXT ELECTION THAT'S GOING TO

04:07:30.268 --> 04:07:34.105
MATTER NOW. AND FOR DONALD TRUMP

04:07:34.172 --> 04:07:36.274
TO GET UP AND SAY PUBLICLY, LIKE

04:07:36.341 --> 04:07:38.843
HE DID A COUPLE OF THINGS WHILE

04:07:38.910 --> 04:07:41.646
HE'S CLAIMING THE ELECTIONS IN

04:07:41.713 --> 04:07:44.115
2020 WERE RIGGED, HE IS NOW

04:07:44.182 --> 04:07:45.684
OPENLY ON BEHALF OF THE

04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:46.718
REPUBLICANS. I HEARD THIS AGAIN

04:07:46.785 --> 04:07:49.487
ON THE RADIO TODAY ON BEHALF OF

04:07:49.554 --> 04:07:51.456
THE REPUBLICANS GOING AFTER HE'S

04:07:51.523 --> 04:07:52.757
GOING TO PUT EXECUTIVE ORDER

04:07:52.824 --> 04:07:55.126
ATTACKING VOTE BY MAIL BECAUSE

04:07:55.193 --> 04:07:57.162
HE SAYS MORE DEMOCRATS VOTE BY

04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:58.663
MAIL THAN MORE REPUBLICANS VOTE

04:07:58.730 --> 04:08:01.766
BY MAIL. HOW CAN YOU NOT RESPOND

04:08:01.833 --> 04:08:03.435
TO THAT IN A POLITICAL MANNER?

04:08:03.501 --> 04:08:05.403
WE DON'T LIKE IT. WE DON'T

04:08:05.470 --> 04:08:06.671
REALLY WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN,

04:08:06.738 --> 04:08:08.607
BUT THERE IS NO OPTION IF IT'S

04:08:08.673 --> 04:08:10.842
GOING TO BE A ONE WAY STREET AND

04:08:10.909 --> 04:08:12.244
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. HE'S

04:08:12.310 --> 04:08:14.479
SAYING IT OPENLY AND IT'S

04:08:14.546 --> 04:08:16.915
THERE'S NO MYSTERY HERE. AND I

04:08:16.982 --> 04:08:18.416
APPRECIATE DILEMMA. OKAY. I

04:08:18.483 --> 04:08:19.918
APPRECIATE THE DILEMMA THAT SOME

04:08:19.985 --> 04:08:21.486
OF OUR MEMBERS HERE FEEL THAT

04:08:21.553 --> 04:08:23.788
THEY ARE IN. I REALLY DO MAKES

04:08:23.855 --> 04:08:25.557
LIFE VERY COMPLICATED, BUT WE

04:08:25.624 --> 04:08:27.392
JUST CAN'T SIT AROUND AND LET

04:08:27.459 --> 04:08:29.995
THAT AGENDA CONTINUE WITHOUT

04:08:30.061 --> 04:08:31.963
PEOPLE PUSHING BACK. SO THANK

04:08:32.030 --> 04:08:34.633
YOU. OKAY. WE'LL NOW OPEN IT UP

04:08:34.699 --> 04:08:36.434

04:08:36.501 --> 04:08:39.771
SUPPORT OF SB 280 CAN COME UP TO

04:08:39.838 --> 04:08:42.474

BECAUSE I HAVE 15 MINUTES AND I

04:19:16.841 --> 04:19:18.276

04:19:19.277 --> 04:19:20.578
MILLION ON A SPECIAL ELECTION

04:19:20.645 --> 04:19:21.746
WHEN CORE PROGRAMS LIKE

04:19:21.812 --> 04:19:22.947
EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND

04:19:23.014 --> 04:19:24.248
WILDFIRE PREVENTION ARE BEING

04:19:24.315 --> 04:19:26.984
CUT? SO FIRST OFF, I WANT TO SAY

04:19:27.051 --> 04:19:28.686
WE'RE IN THIS CRISIS BECAUSE OF

04:19:28.753 --> 04:19:31.422
THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION, AND

04:19:31.489 --> 04:19:33.190
THIS ELECTION IS GOING TO COST

04:19:33.257 --> 04:19:34.959
AS MUCH AS THEY NEW BALLROOM

04:19:35.026 --> 04:19:36.560
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO

04:19:36.627 --> 04:19:38.729
BUILD. AT THE WHITE HOUSE. WE

04:19:38.796 --> 04:19:40.298
HAVE THE FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY

04:19:40.364 --> 04:19:41.933
IN THE WORLD AND A LARGE BUDGET.

04:19:41.999 --> 04:19:43.734
SO WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO

04:19:43.801 --> 04:19:44.902
FUND THOSE THINGS. WE'RE

04:19:44.969 --> 04:19:45.569
EXPECTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

04:19:45.636 --> 04:19:47.438
TO DO THAT. MY NEXT QUESTION IS

04:19:47.505 --> 04:19:49.874
WHY WAS THIS URGENCY ELECTION

04:19:49.941 --> 04:19:51.509
NECESSARY WHEN NO GENUINE

04:19:51.575 --> 04:19:53.344
EMERGENCY EXISTS? THIS THE

04:19:53.411 --> 04:19:54.211
GOVERNOR HAS NOT DECLARED A

04:19:54.278 --> 04:19:56.347
STATE OF EMERGENCY. JUST FEELING

04:19:56.414 --> 04:19:57.982
LIKE WE SHOULD SOUND THE ALARMS

04:19:58.049 --> 04:19:59.650
IS NOT ENOUGH TO DO SO. THERE'S

04:19:59.717 --> 04:20:01.452
AN URGENCY CLAUSE IN HERE.

04:20:01.519 --> 04:20:03.154
AGAIN, THIS IS A CRISIS BROUGHT

04:20:03.220 --> 04:20:06.057
UPON US BECAUSE OF WHAT THE

04:20:06.123 --> 04:20:07.925
STATE OF TEXAS IS DOING. IF THEY

04:20:07.992 --> 04:20:10.728
WOULD PULL BACK THEIR MEASURE,

04:20:10.795 --> 04:20:12.563
WE WOULD NOT BE MOVING FORWARD

04:20:12.630 --> 04:20:15.099
TODAY WITH THIS URGENCY. IT IS A

04:20:15.166 --> 04:20:17.902
CRISIS. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR

04:20:17.969 --> 04:20:19.303
FAMILIES, IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.

04:20:19.370 --> 04:20:21.539
THIS IS HOW CALIFORNIANS HAVE A

04:20:21.605 --> 04:20:23.607
DIRECT RESPONSE AND WHAT IS

04:20:23.674 --> 04:20:24.775
OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE THAT

04:20:24.842 --> 04:20:26.777
THEY WANT TO SEE FOR THIS

04:20:26.844 --> 04:20:27.678
COUNTRY. SO BECAUSE YOU FEEL

04:20:27.745 --> 04:20:29.180
THAT WAY, BUT NO REAL EMERGENCY

04:20:29.246 --> 04:20:30.514
HAS BEEN DECLARED, HOW WILL

04:20:30.581 --> 04:20:32.283
COUNTIES BE REIMBURSED FOR THESE

04:20:32.350 --> 04:20:34.218
COSTS? THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

04:20:34.285 --> 04:20:36.721
WILL DETERMINE THE COST FOR THIS

04:20:36.787 --> 04:20:39.256
ELECTION. THAT WILL BE THROUGH

04:20:39.323 --> 04:20:40.558
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, AS WELL

04:20:40.624 --> 04:20:42.593
AS TO THE COUNTY REGISTRARS TO

04:20:42.660 --> 04:20:43.894
ADMINISTER THE ELECTION ON

04:20:43.961 --> 04:20:45.696
NOVEMBER 4TH. WILL THEY BE PAID

04:20:45.763 --> 04:20:47.832
IN FULL UPFRONT OR LEFT TO BEAR

04:20:47.898 --> 04:20:48.899
THE BURDEN THEMSELVES? THE

04:20:48.966 --> 04:20:51.068
SECRETARY OF STATE I KNOW

04:20:51.135 --> 04:20:51.936
PERHAPS WE HAVE FOLKS HERE OR

04:20:52.003 --> 04:20:54.872
MADAM CHAIR, MY UNDERSTANDING IS

04:20:54.939 --> 04:20:56.207
THE COUNTIES WILL BE PAID

04:20:56.273 --> 04:20:58.642
UPFRONT. IS THAT IN THE LANGUAGE

04:20:58.709 --> 04:21:00.111
OF THE BILL? BECAUSE COUNTIES

04:21:00.177 --> 04:21:02.680
LIKE MINE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO

04:21:02.747 --> 04:21:04.515
THE ELECTION TO THE EXTENT

04:21:04.582 --> 04:21:06.884
NECESSARY. AS A FORMER COUNTY

04:21:06.951 --> 04:21:07.651
ELECTIONS OFFICIAL, THIS IS

04:21:07.718 --> 04:21:08.986
SOMETHING I CARE VERY DEEPLY

04:21:09.053 --> 04:21:10.821
ABOUT. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

04:21:10.888 --> 04:21:13.124
THE COUNTIES ARE MADE WHOLE AND

04:21:13.190 --> 04:21:15.326
THEY RECEIVE THE FUNDS UPFRONT.

04:21:15.393 --> 04:21:17.661
SO CAN WE GET THAT IN THE BILL?

04:21:17.728 --> 04:21:19.797
IT IS IT IS STATED. SO IT IS

04:21:19.864 --> 04:21:21.632
VERY CLEAR THAT COUNTIES WILL BE

04:21:21.699 --> 04:21:23.534
MADE WHOLE TO ADMINISTER THE

04:21:23.601 --> 04:21:26.003
ELECTION ON NOVEMBER 4TH. OKAY.

04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:27.738
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

COUNTY IS VERY RURAL IS GOING TO

04:21:29.774 --> 04:21:31.509
BE TAKEN CARE OF. YOU MADE A

04:21:31.575 --> 04:21:32.843
REALLY GREAT POINT THAT I HAVE

04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:35.346
QUESTIONS, BUT I DO WANT TO

04:21:35.413 --> 04:21:35.946
MENTION THAT YOU TALK ABOUT

04:21:39.683 --> 04:21:41.485
HEARINGS. THEY HAVE TRANSLATORS

04:21:41.552 --> 04:21:42.887
AVAILABLE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, WE

04:21:42.953 --> 04:21:44.655
HAVE NO TRANSLATORS AVAILABLE

04:21:44.722 --> 04:21:47.191
FOR THIS HEARING. SO TALK ABOUT

04:21:47.258 --> 04:21:48.259
DISENFRANCHIZING MINORITY

04:21:48.325 --> 04:21:51.162
COMMUNITIES. WHAT ASSURANCE DO

04:21:51.228 --> 04:21:53.464
COUNTIES HAVE THAT THEY WILL NOT

04:21:53.531 --> 04:21:56.033
BE SUBJECT TO UNFUNDED MANDATES

04:21:56.100 --> 04:21:56.934
BY BEING FORCED TO CARRY OUT

04:21:57.001 --> 04:21:59.804
THIS RUSH PROCESS? AGAIN, IT IS

04:21:59.870 --> 04:22:01.605
STATED IN THE BILL AND THE

04:22:01.672 --> 04:22:03.474
ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. CAN YOU

04:22:03.541 --> 04:22:04.875
POINT TO THE EXACT LANGUAGE IN

04:22:04.942 --> 04:22:06.310
THE BILL? YOUR ATTORNEY? YOU

04:22:06.377 --> 04:22:07.745
HAVE THE ANALYSIS BEFORE YOU.

04:22:07.812 --> 04:22:09.313
I'M NOT ASKING FOR THE ANALYSIS.

04:22:09.380 --> 04:22:10.581
I'M ASKING FOR THE BILL.

04:22:10.648 --> 04:22:12.049
LANGUAGE. THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:22:12.116 --> 04:22:13.851
FINANCE WILL DETERMINE THE COST

04:22:13.918 --> 04:22:16.120
OF THIS ELECTION. AND AT THE END

04:22:16.187 --> 04:22:18.222
OF THE DAY, WE ARE GOING TO

04:22:18.289 --> 04:22:19.323
ENSURE THAT THE COUNTIES WILL

04:22:19.390 --> 04:22:22.193
HAVE EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED

04:22:22.259 --> 04:22:23.894
TO CONDUCT A SPECIAL ELECTION ON

04:22:23.961 --> 04:22:25.262
NOVEMBER 4TH. OKAY. AND I

04:22:25.329 --> 04:22:26.163
APPRECIATE THAT. I APPRECIATE

04:22:26.230 --> 04:22:27.798
THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WHAT I

04:22:27.865 --> 04:22:30.801
AM ASKING FOR IS VERBIAGE IN

04:22:30.868 --> 04:22:31.936
LEGISLATION, AND YOU HAVE AN

04:22:32.002 --> 04:22:32.870
ATTORNEY NEXT TO YOU THAT I'M

04:22:32.937 --> 04:22:34.004
SURE PARTICIPATED IN THE

04:22:34.071 --> 04:22:35.739
DRAFTING OF THIS, AS WELL AS

04:22:35.806 --> 04:22:37.675
YOUR DIRECTOR. I'M ASKING FOR

04:22:37.741 --> 04:22:39.243
NOT JUST YOUR TESTIMONY SAYING,

04:22:39.310 --> 04:22:40.544
WE PROMISE THIS IS GOING TO

04:22:40.611 --> 04:22:41.979
HAPPEN. I'M ASKING AND NOT IN

04:22:42.046 --> 04:22:43.814
THE ANALYSIS, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT

04:22:43.881 --> 04:22:45.816
LEGALLY BINDING. I GOT IT RIGHT

04:22:45.883 --> 04:22:47.718
HERE. SECTION FOUR A, IT SAYS IT

04:22:47.785 --> 04:22:49.453
IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE

04:22:49.520 --> 04:22:50.754
TO ENSURE COUNTIES HAVE

04:22:50.821 --> 04:22:52.723
SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO EFFECTUATE

04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:54.825
THE NOVEMBER 4TH, 2025 SPECIAL

04:22:54.892 --> 04:22:57.361
STATEWIDE ELECTION AND AMOUNT IS

04:22:57.428 --> 04:22:58.496
HEREBY APPROPRIATED FROM THE

04:22:58.562 --> 04:22:59.930
GENERAL FUND TO THE COMPTROLLER

04:22:59.997 --> 04:23:01.665
FOR THE ACTUAL AND REASONABLY

04:23:01.732 --> 04:23:03.067
NECESSARY COSTS, AS DETERMINED

04:23:03.134 --> 04:23:05.002
BY THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE, FOR

04:23:05.069 --> 04:23:06.770
THE COUNTIES TO CONDUCT THAT

04:23:06.837 --> 04:23:08.172
NOVEMBER 4TH, 2025 STATEWIDE

04:23:08.239 --> 04:23:09.907
SPECIAL ELECTION. AGAIN, THIS IS

04:23:09.974 --> 04:23:11.775
NOT A APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

04:23:11.842 --> 04:23:13.611
THE FUNDING ISSUES WILL BE

04:23:13.677 --> 04:23:15.112
ADDRESSED IN THAT COMMITTEE. WE

04:23:15.179 --> 04:23:17.548
ARE POLICY. SO LET'S MOVE OUR

04:23:17.615 --> 04:23:18.582
QUESTIONS BACK TO POLICY. AND

04:23:18.649 --> 04:23:21.085
THIS IS A FUNDING SPECIAL

04:23:21.152 --> 04:23:23.454
ELECTION BILL. SO MY I'M GLAD

04:23:23.521 --> 04:23:25.055
THAT YOU READ THAT ALOUD. SO WE

04:23:25.122 --> 04:23:26.757
HAVE INTENT LANGUAGE. WE KNOW

04:23:26.824 --> 04:23:28.125
HOW MUCH THAT'S LEGALLY BINDING.

04:23:28.192 --> 04:23:29.760
WE HAVE I'M SURE ATTORNEYS IN

04:23:29.827 --> 04:23:32.229
THE ROOM THAT CAN TELL US THAT.

04:23:32.296 --> 04:23:33.264
CAN COUNTIES REALISTICALLY

04:23:33.330 --> 04:23:34.865
ADMINISTER A STATEWIDE

04:23:34.932 --> 04:23:36.667
REDISTRICTING ELECTION ON SUCH A

04:23:36.734 --> 04:23:38.035
COMPRESSED TIMELINE THAT YOU

04:23:38.102 --> 04:23:40.871
TALKED ABOUT WITHOUT ERRORS,

04:23:40.938 --> 04:23:44.241
LAWSUITS, OR DISENFRANCHISEMENT?

04:23:44.308 --> 04:23:45.876
SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD SOME

04:23:45.943 --> 04:23:47.811
TIGHT TIMELINES IN THE PAST, AND

04:23:47.878 --> 04:23:49.713
THIS IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE.

04:23:49.780 --> 04:23:51.248
THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S

04:23:51.315 --> 04:23:52.416
GOING TO BE CHALLENGING

04:23:52.483 --> 04:23:52.983
ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES TO

04:23:53.050 --> 04:23:54.585
THIS ELECTION. BUT I THINK IN

04:23:54.652 --> 04:23:56.987
WORKING WITH WHAT GUIDELINES WE

04:23:57.054 --> 04:23:58.255
HAVE AND WORKING WITH THE

04:23:58.322 --> 04:24:00.357
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE ON

04:24:00.424 --> 04:24:02.593
LOOKING AT SOME DETAILS THAT WE

04:24:02.660 --> 04:24:04.395
CAN WORK COLLECTIVELY TO PUT

04:24:04.461 --> 04:24:06.063
THIS ELECTION. WE'VE DONE A LOT

04:24:06.130 --> 04:24:08.299
OF SUCCESSFUL, DIFFICULT

04:24:08.365 --> 04:24:09.800
ELECTIONS IN THE PAST AND REMIND

04:24:09.867 --> 04:24:12.236
EVERYBODY OF THE 2020 ELECTION,

04:24:12.303 --> 04:24:14.738
WHICH WAS A GENERAL ELECTION

04:24:14.805 --> 04:24:16.740
UNDER COVID, AND WE WERE ABLE TO

04:24:16.807 --> 04:24:19.476
DO AMAZING WORK. AND I KNOW I

04:24:19.543 --> 04:24:20.311
HAVE THE HIGHEST CONFIDENCE IN

04:24:20.377 --> 04:24:21.679
MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE

04:24:21.745 --> 04:24:23.647
THAT THEY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN

04:24:23.714 --> 04:24:26.016
MAKING IT HAPPEN WITH AS LONG AS

04:24:26.083 --> 04:24:26.817
THESE DETAILS THAT WE'RE WORKING

04:24:26.884 --> 04:24:28.919
THROUGH ARE FINALIZED AND CAN BE

04:24:28.986 --> 04:24:30.421
DONE IN A TIMELY FASHION. WHAT

04:24:30.487 --> 04:24:31.722
IS THE SHORTEST TIMELINE? YOU'VE

04:24:31.789 --> 04:24:33.023
PULLED AN ELECTION TOGETHER AND

04:24:33.090 --> 04:24:36.093
BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR? WHEN I

04:24:36.160 --> 04:24:38.862
THINK ABOUT THE TIMING, GOOD

04:24:38.929 --> 04:24:40.030
QUESTION. I DON'T THINK I CAN

04:24:40.097 --> 04:24:41.865
TELL YOU OF A SPECIFIC TIMELINE

04:24:41.932 --> 04:24:43.934
OF WHAT WE'VE DONE. TYPICALLY,

04:24:44.001 --> 04:24:45.369
WE LIKE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL

04:24:45.436 --> 04:24:47.004
TIMING. THAT'S WHY IN THE

04:24:47.071 --> 04:24:47.905
LEGISLATION, ONE OF THE THINGS

04:24:47.972 --> 04:24:50.507
WE DID ASK FOR IS FOR Â -88 CUT

04:24:50.574 --> 04:24:52.042
OFF. AND THE LEGISLATION, WHICH

04:24:52.109 --> 04:24:54.044
WAS HELPFUL FOR US BECAUSE THAT

04:24:54.111 --> 04:24:55.713
GIVES US TIME TO START PREPARING

04:24:55.779 --> 04:24:58.115
AND NOT HAVE OTHER ADD ONS TO

04:24:58.182 --> 04:25:00.050
THE LEGISLATION. SO THAT WAS

04:25:00.117 --> 04:25:01.919
REALLY APPRECIATED ON BEHALF OF

04:25:01.986 --> 04:25:04.488
THE MEMBERS. SO THERE'S NOT A

04:25:04.555 --> 04:25:06.590
SPECIFIC TIMELINE THAT I CAN

04:25:06.657 --> 04:25:08.792
TELL YOU. THE EARLIEST THAT I'VE

04:25:08.859 --> 04:25:09.627
EVER RUN AN ELECTION, I THINK IT

04:25:09.693 --> 04:25:11.595
MAY HAVE BEEN THE RECALL

04:25:11.662 --> 04:25:12.196
ELECTION IN THE PAST, BECAUSE

04:25:12.263 --> 04:25:14.231
THAT BUT WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF

04:25:14.298 --> 04:25:16.834
A HEADS UP ON THAT ONE. BUT THIS

04:25:16.900 --> 04:25:17.534
IS COMING THROUGH THE GATE

04:25:17.601 --> 04:25:19.169
QUICKLY, AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

04:25:19.236 --> 04:25:20.738
RESPONDING AS FAST AS WE CAN. SO

04:25:20.804 --> 04:25:21.872
THIS POTENTIALLY COULD BE THE

04:25:21.939 --> 04:25:22.806
SHORTEST TIMELINE YOU'VE PULLED

04:25:22.873 --> 04:25:23.907
AN ELECTION TOGETHER. COULD

04:25:23.974 --> 04:25:25.075
POTENTIALLY. YES. OKAY. WHICH

04:25:25.142 --> 04:25:26.744
ALSO MAKES ME NERVOUS WHEN WE'VE

04:25:26.810 --> 04:25:28.612
TALKED IN EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS ON

04:25:28.679 --> 04:25:30.014
THIS COMMITTEE, PARTICULARLY

04:25:30.080 --> 04:25:31.782
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT ALL

04:25:31.849 --> 04:25:34.084
VOTERS VOICES ARE HEARD. AND

04:25:34.151 --> 04:25:35.753
ALTHOUGH I CAN APPRECIATE COVID,

04:25:35.819 --> 04:25:37.488
IT SEEMED LIKE DAILY THINGS WERE

04:25:37.554 --> 04:25:38.622
CHANGING. IT WAS STILL DURING A

04:25:38.689 --> 04:25:40.424
GENERAL ELECTION THAT WE KNEW

04:25:40.491 --> 04:25:41.825
WAS COMING. SO I THINK THAT'S A

04:25:41.892 --> 04:25:42.960
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, BUT IT

04:25:43.027 --> 04:25:44.762
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE UP FOR THE

04:25:44.828 --> 04:25:46.030
CHALLENGE. SO THEN MY NEXT

04:25:46.096 --> 04:25:47.731
QUESTION IS, IS THIS PROCESS

04:25:47.798 --> 04:25:49.400
FAIR TO COUNTY REGISTRARS AND

04:25:49.466 --> 04:25:51.135
ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WHO ALREADY

04:25:51.201 --> 04:25:52.403
FACE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO

04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:55.973
ENSURE ACCURACY? SO I KNOW WE

04:25:56.040 --> 04:25:58.108
ARE SO TO UNDERSTAND YOUR

04:25:58.175 --> 04:26:00.477
QUESTION, YOU'RE ASKING IF THIS

04:26:00.544 --> 04:26:02.846
IS HOW I MEAN, YOUR JOB IS TOUGH

04:26:02.913 --> 04:26:03.881
ENOUGH. AND WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR

04:26:03.947 --> 04:26:05.949
CHAIR WHO WAS AN ELECTIONS

04:26:06.016 --> 04:26:07.151
OFFICIAL, THIS IS A TOUGH JOB.

04:26:07.217 --> 04:26:09.386
AND NOW WE ARE ADDING EVEN MORE

04:26:09.453 --> 04:26:11.121
TO YOUR PLATE. I JUST DON'T

04:26:11.188 --> 04:26:12.056
THINK THAT'S VERY FAIR THAT

04:26:12.122 --> 04:26:13.891
WE'RE DEMANDING MORE FROM YOU

04:26:13.957 --> 04:26:15.492
GUYS AND NOT REALLY GIVING YOU

04:26:15.559 --> 04:26:17.261
MUCH OF A RUNWAY TO DO IT. WELL,

04:26:17.328 --> 04:26:18.962
I DO THINK THAT THE RESOURCES

04:26:19.029 --> 04:26:20.197
ARE GOING TO BE HELPFUL FOR

04:26:20.264 --> 04:26:21.498
SURE, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

04:26:21.565 --> 04:26:23.033
RESOURCES, MEANING FINANCES OR

04:26:23.100 --> 04:26:24.702
WHAT OTHER RESOURCES, WELL,

04:26:24.768 --> 04:26:26.236
FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY

04:26:26.303 --> 04:26:28.038
PAY FOR IT, BECAUSE THAT IS A

04:26:28.105 --> 04:26:29.139
CRITICAL NEED. AND THAT'S WHY

04:26:29.206 --> 04:26:30.974
RIGHT NOW I CAN TELL YOU ACROSS

04:26:31.041 --> 04:26:32.876
THE STATE, THERE ARE REGISTRARS

04:26:32.943 --> 04:26:34.111
ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE

04:26:34.178 --> 04:26:34.945
ALREADY BEGUN THE PROCESS,

04:26:35.012 --> 04:26:36.313
BECAUSE ONCE WE HEARD THAT THIS

04:26:36.380 --> 04:26:38.082
LEGISLATION WAS COMING DOWN THE

04:26:38.148 --> 04:26:39.550
PIKE, WE'VE BEGUN TO MAKE PLANS.

04:26:39.616 --> 04:26:41.352
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IN MY OFFICE,

04:26:41.418 --> 04:26:43.153
WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN TO GO

04:26:43.220 --> 04:26:43.987
THROUGH OUR CHECKLIST AND MAKING

04:26:44.054 --> 04:26:45.322
SURE THAT WE GET CAUGHT UP

04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:46.724
BECAUSE THERE'S A CHECKLIST THAT

04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:48.892
WE'RE GOING THROUGH. SO WE'RE

04:26:48.959 --> 04:26:49.727
QUICKLY NAVIGATING THAT LIST,

04:26:49.793 --> 04:26:51.061
AND WE'RE REACHING OUT TO OUR

04:26:51.128 --> 04:26:52.796
VENDORS. WE'RE REACHING OUT TO

04:26:52.863 --> 04:26:54.264
OUR LOCATIONS BECAUSE WE'RE

04:26:54.331 --> 04:26:55.499
EXPEDITIOUSLY TRYING TO MAKE

04:26:55.566 --> 04:26:56.900
SURE WE ARE READY FOR THIS

04:26:56.967 --> 04:26:58.268
ELECTION. AND YES, THERE'S A LOT

04:26:58.335 --> 04:26:59.870
OF WORK AHEAD. I'M NOT GOING TO

04:26:59.937 --> 04:27:01.805
SAY THAT THERE'S NOT. AND IT'S

04:27:01.872 --> 04:27:02.873
TRUE ACROSS THE STATE. SO IS IT

04:27:02.940 --> 04:27:05.008
GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE? YES.

04:27:05.075 --> 04:27:06.176
THERE'S ADMINISTRATIVE

04:27:06.243 --> 04:27:06.710
CHALLENGES TO SUCH A SHORT

04:27:06.777 --> 04:27:08.445
TIMELINE, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT

04:27:08.512 --> 04:27:09.380
THE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IN THE

04:27:09.446 --> 04:27:11.648
PAST, THEY HAVE STEPPED UP IN

04:27:11.715 --> 04:27:13.450
TREMENDOUS WAYS. AND LOOKING

04:27:13.517 --> 04:27:15.519
AGAIN AT THE 2020 ELECTION, I'M

04:27:15.586 --> 04:27:17.354
PROUD TO SAY THAT I'M A MEMBER

04:27:17.421 --> 04:27:19.256
OF THIS MEMBERSHIP THAT HAS DONE

04:27:19.323 --> 04:27:20.591
AN AMAZING JOB IN THE PAST, AND

04:27:20.657 --> 04:27:22.693
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN RISE TO THE

04:27:22.760 --> 04:27:24.495
OCCASION AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE

04:27:24.561 --> 04:27:26.296
SUPPORT AND THE NOT ONLY THE

04:27:26.363 --> 04:27:27.865
FUNDING, BUT THE LITTLE DETAILS

04:27:27.931 --> 04:27:29.299
THAT WILL BE WORKING WITH

04:27:29.366 --> 04:27:31.034
SECRETARY OF STATE TO MAKE SURE

04:27:31.101 --> 04:27:31.969
WE CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN MAKING

04:27:32.035 --> 04:27:33.504
SURE TO RUN THESE ELECTIONS. SO

04:27:33.570 --> 04:27:35.205
STATE RESOURCES HAVE ALREADY

04:27:35.272 --> 04:27:36.940
GONE INTO THIS PROCESS, IS WHAT

04:27:37.007 --> 04:27:38.208
YOU'RE TELLING ME? NO, WE'RE

04:27:38.275 --> 04:27:39.576
PLANNING AS IF IT'S COMING

04:27:39.643 --> 04:27:40.778
BECAUSE WE'VE READ THROUGH THE

04:27:40.844 --> 04:27:42.146
LEGISLATION THAT THERE WILL BE

04:27:42.212 --> 04:27:44.381
FUNDING FOR IT. SO WE ARE MOVING

04:27:44.448 --> 04:27:45.482
FORWARD WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT

04:27:45.549 --> 04:27:47.284
WE WILL BE HAVING RESOURCES TO

04:27:47.351 --> 04:27:49.019
PAY FOR THIS ELECTION FROM THE

04:27:49.086 --> 04:27:50.754
STATE. CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH

04:27:50.821 --> 04:27:51.889
WHAT THIS PLANNING INCLUDES? IF

04:27:51.955 --> 04:27:53.991
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE FUNDING TO DO

04:27:54.057 --> 04:27:55.993
WHAT IS THIS JUST A CHECKLIST

04:27:56.059 --> 04:27:57.995
WHERE WE WILL CONTACT VENDORS TO

04:27:58.061 --> 04:27:59.730
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

04:27:59.797 --> 04:28:01.465
DO THE PRINT JOBS. IN TIME, WE

04:28:01.532 --> 04:28:03.801
WILL BE CONTACTING OUR LOCATIONS

04:28:03.867 --> 04:28:05.602
THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

04:28:05.669 --> 04:28:07.704
HAVE LOCATIONS AVAILABLE TO RUN

04:28:07.771 --> 04:28:09.139
THESE ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE

04:28:09.206 --> 04:28:10.941
CRITICAL BECAUSE IF THERE ARE VÀ

04:28:11.008 --> 04:28:12.276
VERSUS A POLLING PLACE, THERE'S

04:28:12.342 --> 04:28:13.477
DIFFERENT TIMELINES THAT ARE

04:28:13.544 --> 04:28:15.012
REQUIRED. SO THOSE ARE FACTORS

04:28:15.078 --> 04:28:16.447
THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH

04:28:16.513 --> 04:28:17.948
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

04:28:18.015 --> 04:28:20.984
LINE UP NOT ONLY LOCATIONS, THE

04:28:21.051 --> 04:28:22.453
VENDORS, WE HAVE TO GET

04:28:22.519 --> 04:28:23.554
TRANSLATORS TALKING ABOUT

04:28:23.620 --> 04:28:25.689
TRANSLATORS, WE HAVE TO MAKE

04:28:25.756 --> 04:28:26.924
SURE THAT TRANSLATORS ARE READY

04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.925
FOR ALL OF THIS. SO THERE'S JUST

04:28:27.991 --> 04:28:29.693
A MYRIAD OF ISSUES. WE HAVE A

04:28:29.760 --> 04:28:31.628
CHECKLIST TO GIVE YOU A CONTEXT.

04:28:31.695 --> 04:28:32.930
WE HAVE A CHECKLIST OF SOME 500

04:28:32.996 --> 04:28:34.164
ITEMS THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH

04:28:34.231 --> 04:28:35.732
THROUGH EVERY ELECTION. SO WE'RE

04:28:35.799 --> 04:28:36.800
SPEEDING THROUGH THOSE TO MAKE

04:28:36.867 --> 04:28:38.735
SURE WE DON'T MISS ANYTHING. SO

04:28:38.802 --> 04:28:40.938
ONE OF THE THINGS I TAKE GREAT

04:28:41.004 --> 04:28:41.972
PRIDE IN, IN OUR ASSOCIATION IS

04:28:42.039 --> 04:28:43.340
WE ARE ATTENTION TO DETAIL. WE

04:28:43.407 --> 04:28:44.908
HAVE OUR CHECKLIST. WE WILL MAKE

04:28:44.975 --> 04:28:46.743
SURE NOT TO SKIP ANY OF THOSE.

04:28:46.810 --> 04:28:48.712
ARE WE GOING TO QUICKLY GO

04:28:48.779 --> 04:28:50.614
THROUGH THEM TO TRY AND CATCH

04:28:50.681 --> 04:28:51.248
UP? YES WE WILL. AND EVERYBODY

04:28:51.315 --> 04:28:53.016
ACROSS THE STATE IS DOING THAT.

04:28:53.083 --> 04:28:55.619
SO WE ARE WORKING HARD WITH THE

04:28:55.686 --> 04:28:56.854
ANTICIPATION THAT THIS IS A

04:28:56.920 --> 04:28:58.422
PENDING LEGISLATION, THAT IF IT

04:28:58.489 --> 04:29:00.190
DOES GO THROUGH, GO THROUGH,

04:29:00.257 --> 04:29:01.725
THAT WE'RE READY TO MOVE FORWARD

04:29:01.792 --> 04:29:02.926
TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES,

04:29:02.993 --> 04:29:04.962
GIVEN THIS VERY COMPRESSED

04:29:05.028 --> 04:29:05.829
TIMELINE, BECAUSE IT IS A

04:29:05.896 --> 04:29:07.231
COMPRESSED TIMELINE, I WILL

04:29:07.297 --> 04:29:09.132
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. SO NO VENDORS,

04:29:09.199 --> 04:29:11.435
NO LOCATIONS, NOBODY HAS BEEN

04:29:11.502 --> 04:29:12.536
CONTACTED, JUST THE CREATION OF

04:29:12.603 --> 04:29:14.304
A CHECKLIST. WE'VE BEEN

04:29:14.371 --> 04:29:15.072
CONTACTING VENDORS. WE ACTUALLY

04:29:15.138 --> 04:29:16.874
HAVE BEEN CONTACTING VENDORS,

04:29:16.940 --> 04:29:18.542
CONTACTING LOCATIONS. WE ARE

04:29:18.609 --> 04:29:20.410
ACTUALLY TRYING TO LOCK DOWN ALL

04:29:20.477 --> 04:29:23.280
OF THE LOCATIONS. WE HAVE A FEW

04:29:23.347 --> 04:29:24.781
STILL OUTSTANDING. FOR MYSELF IN

04:29:24.848 --> 04:29:26.717
YOLO COUNTY, WE STILL HAVE A FEW

04:29:26.783 --> 04:29:27.751
OUTSTANDING, BUT WE'VE GOT MOST

04:29:27.818 --> 04:29:29.520
OF THEM LOCKED UP, SO THERE'S

04:29:29.586 --> 04:29:31.088
STILL A PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO

04:29:31.154 --> 04:29:34.791
DO TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO

04:29:34.858 --> 04:29:36.593
THE CHECKLIST AND VERIFY THAT

04:29:36.660 --> 04:29:37.928
WE'RE READY TO RUN THE ELECTION.

04:29:37.995 --> 04:29:39.630
WE'RE NOT DONE YET. IT'S AN

04:29:39.696 --> 04:29:41.665
ONGOING PROCESS. STILL. WHEN

04:29:41.732 --> 04:29:42.900
SPECIFICALLY DID YOU START THIS

04:29:42.966 --> 04:29:44.668
PROCESS? DO YOU HAVE A DATE? SO

04:29:44.735 --> 04:29:46.203
WE STARTED WHEN WE HEARD THROUGH

04:29:46.270 --> 04:29:48.105
THE GRAPEVINE, THERE WOULD BE A

04:29:48.171 --> 04:29:49.239
POTENTIAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION

04:29:49.306 --> 04:29:50.374
COMING OUT. WHEN ANNOUNCEMENTS

04:29:50.440 --> 04:29:52.776
STARTED COMING OUT, WE AS

04:29:52.843 --> 04:29:54.678
REGISTRARS BECAME PROACTIVE

04:29:54.745 --> 04:29:57.214
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WAIT TILL IT'S

04:29:57.281 --> 04:29:58.649
ALREADY DONE AND APPROVED. YOU

04:29:58.715 --> 04:29:59.783
HAVE TO START LINING UP AS

04:29:59.850 --> 04:30:02.286
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO WE ARE

04:30:02.352 --> 04:30:04.321
ALREADY STARTED THIS A COUPLE OF

04:30:04.388 --> 04:30:05.756
WEEKS AGO, WHEN WORD WAS OUT

04:30:05.822 --> 04:30:07.558
THAT THERE WAS LIKELY A POSSIBLE

04:30:07.624 --> 04:30:08.959
PIECE OF LEGISLATION COMING

04:30:09.026 --> 04:30:10.727
THROUGH. SO ACROSS THE STATE, WE

04:30:10.794 --> 04:30:13.697
STARTED CONTACTING OUR VENDORS,

04:30:13.764 --> 04:30:15.799
OUR CONTACTS, TO SAY, IN THE

04:30:15.866 --> 04:30:17.668
EVENT THIS HAPPENS, WE WANT TO

04:30:17.734 --> 04:30:19.269
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE READY FOR

04:30:19.336 --> 04:30:21.371
IT. SO THAT'S PRIMARILY WHERE

04:30:21.438 --> 04:30:23.273
HOW WE'VE APPROACHED IT. SO YOU

04:30:23.340 --> 04:30:25.008
HAVEN'T SIGNED ANY CONTRACTS

04:30:25.075 --> 04:30:26.977
WITH VENDORS AT THIS POINT? WE

04:30:27.044 --> 04:30:28.245
JUST CONTACTED THEM. YES. WE ARE

04:30:28.312 --> 04:30:29.947
CONTACTING THEM TO SEE THEIR

04:30:30.013 --> 04:30:32.349
AVAILABILITY TO SEE IF THERE'S

04:30:32.416 --> 04:30:33.550
LOCATIONS AVAILABLE. SO WE'RE IN

04:30:33.617 --> 04:30:35.285
THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT

04:30:35.352 --> 04:30:36.453
BECAUSE AGAIN, THIS HASN'T

04:30:36.520 --> 04:30:37.321
OFFICIALLY BEEN PASSED YET.

04:30:37.387 --> 04:30:38.722
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO

04:30:38.789 --> 04:30:40.857
IT UNTIL WE KNOW THIS

04:30:40.924 --> 04:30:42.059
LEGISLATION IS PASSED. BUT YOU

04:30:42.125 --> 04:30:43.694
TRY AND FRONT LOAD IT AS MUCH AS

04:30:43.760 --> 04:30:46.096
YOU CAN. AND THAT'S TRUE OF ANY

04:30:46.163 --> 04:30:47.030
ELECTION. YOU TRY AND FRONT LOAD

04:30:47.097 --> 04:30:48.799
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN THAT

04:30:48.865 --> 04:30:50.834
PROCESS. INTERESTING. IF THE

04:30:50.901 --> 04:30:51.768
JUSTIFICATION FOR URGENCY IS

04:30:51.835 --> 04:30:53.370
POLITICAL ADVANTAGE RATHER THAN

04:30:53.437 --> 04:30:56.807
A TRUE EMERGENCY, DOES THIS NOT

04:30:56.873 --> 04:30:58.976
SET A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT

04:30:59.042 --> 04:31:01.511
FOR FUTURE LEGISLATURES? WELL, I

04:31:01.578 --> 04:31:03.647
FIND IT INTERESTING THAT YOUR

04:31:03.714 --> 04:31:05.782
LINE OF QUESTIONING IS ON THE

04:31:05.849 --> 04:31:07.284
TIMING AND ON THE FINANCE. WHEN

04:31:07.351 --> 04:31:08.685
YOUR OWN PARTY CALLED FOR THE

04:31:08.752 --> 04:31:12.623
RECALL IN 2021 SPECIAL ELECTION.

04:31:12.689 --> 04:31:14.024
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

04:31:14.091 --> 04:31:16.226
RECALL. I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS

04:31:16.293 --> 04:31:17.160
KEEPS GETTING BROUGHT UP TODAY.

04:31:17.227 --> 04:31:19.229
I'D REALLY LIKE TO STICK TO THE

04:31:19.296 --> 04:31:23.033
MERITS OF THE BILL. SO NO ANSWER

04:31:23.100 --> 04:31:24.701
FOR THAT. I GAVE YOU MY

04:31:24.768 --> 04:31:27.037
RESPONSE. WOULD ANY OF THE

04:31:27.104 --> 04:31:28.839
WITNESSES LIKE TO ANSWER THAT

04:31:28.905 --> 04:31:30.440
QUESTION? I'M SURE IT WILL COME

04:31:30.507 --> 04:31:33.977
UP IN COURT, BUT. OKAY, THAT'S

04:31:34.044 --> 04:31:35.746
ALL I HAVE, MADAM CHAIR. THANK

04:31:35.812 --> 04:31:38.515
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND

04:31:38.582 --> 04:31:40.384
THERE'S 15 MINUTES. THANK YOU.

04:31:40.450 --> 04:31:42.185
YEAH. I MEAN, WE HEARD IN THE

04:31:42.252 --> 04:31:43.320
TESTIMONY THAT CHANGING THE

04:31:43.387 --> 04:31:45.122
RULES OF THE GAME IN THE MIDDLE

04:31:45.188 --> 04:31:46.590
OF IT ARE, YOU KNOW,

04:31:46.657 --> 04:31:48.258
UNACCEPTABLE. AND YET WE

04:31:48.325 --> 04:31:49.693
DISPLAYED THAT RIGHT HERE. BUT

04:31:49.760 --> 04:31:50.894
OKAY, WE'LL HOP INTO THE

04:31:50.961 --> 04:31:52.663
QUESTIONS THEN. DO YOU BELIEVE

04:31:52.729 --> 04:31:53.664
THAT THE INDEPENDENT

04:31:53.730 --> 04:31:56.500
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION

04:31:56.566 --> 04:31:57.567
CONGRESSIONAL LINES CONFORM TO

04:31:57.634 --> 04:32:00.170
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION? TO

04:32:00.237 --> 04:32:02.639
THE AUTHOR, ANYBODY DO YOU

04:32:02.706 --> 04:32:04.107
BELIEVE. I'M SORRY. CAN YOU

04:32:04.174 --> 04:32:04.941
REPEAT THE QUESTION? DO YOU

04:32:05.008 --> 04:32:06.943
BELIEVE THAT THE INDEPENDENT

04:32:07.010 --> 04:32:07.511
REDISTRICTING, REDISTRICTING

04:32:07.577 --> 04:32:08.378
COMMISSIONS, CONGRESSIONAL LINES

04:32:08.445 --> 04:32:09.946
CONFORM TO THE CALIFORNIA

04:32:10.013 --> 04:32:12.549
CONSTITUTION? YES. DID THEY

04:32:12.616 --> 04:32:16.386
FOLLOW THE VOTER RIGHTS ACT? I

04:32:16.453 --> 04:32:17.888
BELIEVE SO, YES. I MEAN THAT

04:32:17.954 --> 04:32:19.022
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CHALLENGED.

04:32:19.089 --> 04:32:21.258
BUT YES, I HAVE A REASON TO

04:32:21.324 --> 04:32:22.826
BELIEVE THEY WERE LEGAL AND

04:32:22.893 --> 04:32:25.429
COMPLIED WITH ALL OF THE RULES,

04:32:25.495 --> 04:32:26.697
FEDERAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL

04:32:26.763 --> 04:32:28.965
RULES. SO PROTECTED CLASSES,

04:32:29.032 --> 04:32:30.500
DISTRICTS WERE CREATED TO

04:32:30.567 --> 04:32:32.202
PROTECT OFF OF RACE, RELIGION,

04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:33.737
SEX, ALL OF THAT. I WASN'T

04:32:33.804 --> 04:32:34.905
INVOLVED IN THOSE LINES, BUT BUT

04:32:34.971 --> 04:32:37.541
YOU JUST SPOKE THAT YOU KNEW THE

04:32:37.607 --> 04:32:38.075
LINES. AND CAN YOU ASK THE

04:32:38.141 --> 04:32:39.743
QUESTIONS TO THE MERIT OF THIS

04:32:39.810 --> 04:32:41.945
BILL? YEAH. I HAVE NO REASON TO

04:32:42.012 --> 04:32:44.047
BELIEVE THAT THE REDISTRICTING

04:32:44.114 --> 04:32:45.816
COMMISSIONS PLANS WERE NOT IN

04:32:45.882 --> 04:32:48.351
COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL ALL

04:32:48.418 --> 04:32:49.386
FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE

04:32:49.453 --> 04:32:51.655
VOTING RIGHTS ACT. CAN I ASK

04:32:51.722 --> 04:32:54.524
YOU, HOW LONG HAVE YOU SEEN THIS

04:32:54.591 --> 04:32:55.559
PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND HOW

04:32:55.625 --> 04:32:56.993
LONG YOU WERE GRANTED ACCESS TO

04:32:57.060 --> 04:32:59.096
THIS? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE

04:32:59.162 --> 04:33:00.230
WHICH WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

04:33:00.297 --> 04:33:01.832
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE BILL?

04:33:01.898 --> 04:33:03.033
HOW LONG HAVE YOU SEEN THE

04:33:03.100 --> 04:33:05.202
LANGUAGE? ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

04:33:05.268 --> 04:33:07.270
THESE LINES OR THE REDISTRICTING

04:33:07.337 --> 04:33:12.909
COMMISSIONS LINES? MY ORIGINAL.

04:33:12.976 --> 04:33:16.146
THESE LINES I'M TALKING ABOUT.

04:33:16.213 --> 04:33:17.814
THIS IS NOT THE MAPS BILL. THE

04:33:17.881 --> 04:33:20.383
CONDUCT OF THE ELECTIONS. NO, I

04:33:20.450 --> 04:33:25.555
UNDERSTAND THAT. NO, I KNOW. DO

04:33:25.622 --> 04:33:27.157
YOU THINK THAT ANY OF THE LINES

04:33:27.224 --> 04:33:28.959
DRAWN BY THE COMMISSION WERE

04:33:29.025 --> 04:33:30.994
RACIALLY GERRYMANDERED BY THE

04:33:31.061 --> 04:33:32.629
COMMISSION? BY THE COMMISSION?

04:33:32.696 --> 04:33:35.165
YEAH, BY THE REDISTRICTING

04:33:35.232 --> 04:33:36.600
COMMISSION. THESE ARE NOT

04:33:36.666 --> 04:33:38.769
QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO SB TWO.

04:33:38.835 --> 04:33:40.904
SB 280 CONTAINS THE COMPONENTS

04:33:40.971 --> 04:33:42.339
THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING

04:33:42.405 --> 04:33:43.607
THAT COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS

04:33:43.673 --> 04:33:44.541
AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE ARE

04:33:44.608 --> 04:33:47.043
ABLE TO ADMINISTER THE STATEWIDE

04:33:47.110 --> 04:33:48.879
SPECIAL ELECTION IN THIS TIME

04:33:48.945 --> 04:33:51.381
FRAME. SO IT'S NOT GOING INTO

04:33:51.448 --> 04:33:53.483
THE DETAILS OF THE MAPS. THIS IS

04:33:53.550 --> 04:33:55.619
ACTUALLY THE ADMINISTRATION OF

04:33:55.685 --> 04:33:58.121
THE ELECTION AND THE FUNDING OF

04:33:58.188 --> 04:34:09.833
IT. OKAY, I UNDERSTAND. THERE'S

04:34:09.900 --> 04:34:12.736
SO MANY CHANGES THAT HAVE

04:34:12.803 --> 04:34:20.177
HAPPENED. YOU KNOW, IT'S.

04:34:20.243 --> 04:34:21.678
WOULDN'T WE THINK THAT A LOT OF

04:34:21.745 --> 04:34:23.113
THESE QUESTIONS WOULD BE WORKED

04:34:23.180 --> 04:34:25.415
OUT IF WE HAD LONGER THAN 24

04:34:25.482 --> 04:34:26.917
HOURS TO REVIEW THIS? BECAUSE

04:34:26.983 --> 04:34:27.517
THAT'S WHAT I THINK. I MEAN,

04:34:27.584 --> 04:34:29.886
THERE'S A STRUGGLE HERE FOR A

04:34:29.953 --> 04:34:31.855
GENERAL REASON BECAUSE I HAVEN'T

04:34:31.922 --> 04:34:42.332
SEEN HIM. THE VOTER GUIDE FOR

04:34:42.399 --> 04:34:45.702
PROP 20 ALSO STATED, IT'LL BE

04:34:45.769 --> 04:34:48.638
PUT IT'LL PUT AN END TO BACKROOM

04:34:48.705 --> 04:34:52.175
DEALS BY ENSURING REDISTRICTING

04:34:52.242 --> 04:34:53.677
IS COMPLETELY OPEN TO THE

04:34:53.743 --> 04:34:56.580
PUBLIC. KCRA JUST REPORTED THAT

04:34:56.646 --> 04:34:59.049
THERE IS A CERTAIN SENATOR WHO

04:34:59.115 --> 04:35:01.251
AGREED TO SUPPORT THIS IF

04:35:01.318 --> 04:35:02.219
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS WERE

04:35:02.285 --> 04:35:06.523
DRAWN FOR HIM. SO YOU AGREE THAT

04:35:06.590 --> 04:35:08.458
THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESS IS TO

04:35:08.525 --> 04:35:10.493
UNDERMINE PROP 20, AND A

04:35:10.560 --> 04:35:13.029
BACKROOM DEAL WAS DONE. MY

04:35:13.096 --> 04:35:15.565
QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR NOW IS

04:35:15.632 --> 04:35:17.200
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ABOUT

04:35:17.267 --> 04:35:19.636
THESE LINES WITH THIS URGENCY

04:35:19.703 --> 04:35:21.404
INVOLVED, DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY

04:35:21.471 --> 04:35:22.806
THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED THAT HAS

04:35:22.873 --> 04:35:24.641
A VESTED INTEREST IN THIS

04:35:24.708 --> 04:35:26.476
LEGISLATIVE BODY? AND DO YOU

04:35:26.543 --> 04:35:28.645
HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THESE

04:35:28.712 --> 04:35:29.846
IN THIS ELECTION BEING

04:35:29.913 --> 04:35:31.781
PERFORMED? AGAIN, THIS BILL

04:35:31.848 --> 04:35:35.018
BEFORE US, SB 280, CALLS FOR THE

04:35:35.085 --> 04:35:37.587
ELECTION TO TAKE PLACE ON

04:35:37.654 --> 04:35:39.856
NOVEMBER 4TH, 2025. AND THE

04:35:39.923 --> 04:35:40.824
ADMINISTRATION OF THAT ELECTION

04:35:40.891 --> 04:35:42.692
MAKING STATUTORY CHANGES TO

04:35:42.759 --> 04:35:45.095
ENSURE THAT A PRIMARY WILL BE

04:35:45.161 --> 04:35:46.663
CONDUCTED ON TIME JUNE OF NEXT

04:35:46.730 --> 04:35:49.866
YEAR. DO YOU HAVE A VESTED

04:35:49.933 --> 04:35:51.968
INTEREST IN THESE LINES IN THIS

04:35:52.035 --> 04:35:53.904
ELECTION TO THIS BILL? THIS IS

04:35:53.970 --> 04:35:55.639
WHAT WE'RE PERTAINING TO. THIS

04:35:55.705 --> 04:35:58.275
ELECTION IS THE SB 280 CALLING

04:35:58.341 --> 04:36:00.677
FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION AGAINST

04:36:00.744 --> 04:36:02.779
THE RIGGING THAT IS HAPPENING

04:36:02.846 --> 04:36:05.248
ACROSS OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OF

04:36:05.315 --> 04:36:07.117
WHAT TRUMP IS DEMANDING OF

04:36:07.183 --> 04:36:08.585
TEXAS. AND GOVERNOR ABBOTT, THIS

04:36:08.652 --> 04:36:10.954
IS HOW CALIFORNIA RESPONDS, AND

04:36:11.021 --> 04:36:14.357
THIS IS HOW WE ALLOW 40 MILLION

04:36:14.424 --> 04:36:16.159
CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE A SAY IN

04:36:16.226 --> 04:36:17.227
THE DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY

04:36:17.294 --> 04:36:18.528
BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY IN THIS

04:36:18.595 --> 04:36:20.730
BILL. DO YOU HAVE ANY VESTED

04:36:20.797 --> 04:36:23.700
INTEREST IN IT? DEMOCRACY. DO

04:36:23.767 --> 04:36:26.703
YOU HAVE ANY? IT IS DEMOCRACY

04:36:26.770 --> 04:36:27.938
THAT WE ARE STANDING UP FOR.

04:36:28.004 --> 04:36:30.140
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.

04:36:30.206 --> 04:36:31.975
SO DEMOCRACY REQUIRES AN

04:36:32.042 --> 04:36:33.576
EMERGENCY RESPONSE. YOU CAN'T

04:36:33.643 --> 04:36:36.279
SAY AGAIN, YOU YOU CAN'T SAY

04:36:36.346 --> 04:36:37.781
THAT YOU HAVE A VESTED INTEREST

04:36:37.847 --> 04:36:39.582
BECAUSE OF DEMOCRACY. I HAVE A

04:36:39.649 --> 04:36:41.651
VESTED INTEREST IN SUPPORTING MY

04:36:41.718 --> 04:36:42.752
CONSTITUENCY AND MAKING SURE

04:36:42.819 --> 04:36:44.187
THAT I FIGHT FOR THEM. WHEN WE

04:36:44.254 --> 04:36:46.022
GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS, JUST

04:36:46.089 --> 04:36:48.525
AS WE DID OVER SUMMER RECESS, WE

04:36:48.591 --> 04:36:50.593
GET ASKED, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO

04:36:50.660 --> 04:36:52.195
STAND UP AGAINST THIS POWER

04:36:52.262 --> 04:36:54.230
GRAB, AGAINST THIS POLITICAL

04:36:54.297 --> 04:36:55.365
GERRYMANDERING THAT IS

04:36:55.432 --> 04:36:57.500
HAPPENING? WHAT CAN YOU DO AS

04:36:57.567 --> 04:36:59.402
OUR STATE REPRESENTATIVE? THIS

04:36:59.469 --> 04:37:01.771
IS HOW WE RESPOND. THIS IS OUR

04:37:01.838 --> 04:37:05.642
DUTY TO UPHOLD AND TO ENSURE

04:37:05.709 --> 04:37:08.945
THAT WE CONTINUE HAVING THE FAIR

04:37:09.012 --> 04:37:11.581
AND FAIR ELECTIONS, NOT JUST IN

04:37:11.648 --> 04:37:13.016
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, BUT

04:37:13.083 --> 04:37:15.151
ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, BECAUSE

04:37:15.218 --> 04:37:16.987
CALIFORNIA WILL REMAIN THE

04:37:17.053 --> 04:37:20.557
FIREWALL. THIS IS WHAT VOTERS

04:37:20.623 --> 04:37:23.193
ARE ASKING FOR. THEY WANT TO

04:37:23.259 --> 04:37:25.228
HAVE A SAY AT THE BALLOT BOX.

04:37:25.295 --> 04:37:27.063
AND AGAIN, MUCH DIFFERENT THAN

04:37:27.130 --> 04:37:29.566
WHAT TEXAS IS DOING. TEXAS IS

04:37:29.632 --> 04:37:31.701
DRAWING THEIR LINES TO CHOOSE

04:37:31.768 --> 04:37:33.970
THEIR VOTERS, AS OPPOSED TO

04:37:34.037 --> 04:37:35.705
LETTING VOTERS CHOOSE WHO THEIR

04:37:35.772 --> 04:37:37.807
REPRESENTATIVE IS. SENATOR, I

04:37:37.874 --> 04:37:40.377
UNDERSTAND THAT. AND BUT THIS IS

04:37:40.443 --> 04:37:42.245
CALIFORNIA, AND THIS IS THE

04:37:42.312 --> 04:37:42.879
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THAT I'M

04:37:42.946 --> 04:37:45.115
TRYING TO SPEAK ABOUT, WHICH IS

04:37:45.181 --> 04:37:47.183
WHY I'M SIMPLY JUST ASKING IF

04:37:47.250 --> 04:37:47.784
THERE IS A VESTED INTEREST IN

04:37:47.851 --> 04:37:51.121
THESE LINES AND IF ANYBODY IN IN

04:37:51.187 --> 04:37:52.989
CALIFORNIA HAS A VESTED INTEREST

04:37:53.056 --> 04:37:55.158
BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY BEHIND

04:37:55.225 --> 04:37:57.894
THIS, BECAUSE THIS WE CAN DO ALL

04:37:57.961 --> 04:38:00.663
OF THIS AND THEN COMPLETELY LOSE

04:38:00.730 --> 04:38:02.799
IT. MADAM CHAIR, THE AND THE AND

04:38:02.866 --> 04:38:04.968
THE AND THE URGENCY ON THIS IS

04:38:05.035 --> 04:38:05.602
BECAUSE THE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS

04:38:05.668 --> 04:38:07.404
NEED TO BE MOVING AHEAD AND

04:38:07.470 --> 04:38:08.805
CONTINUING THEIR PROCESS TO

04:38:08.872 --> 04:38:11.107
CONDUCT THAT SECURE, ACCURATE,

04:38:11.174 --> 04:38:12.375
TRANSPARENT, ACCESSIBLE ELECTION

04:38:12.442 --> 04:38:13.777
ON NOVEMBER 4TH SO WE CAN KEEP

04:38:13.843 --> 04:38:15.679
THE QUESTIONS TO THE MERITS OF

04:38:15.745 --> 04:38:17.614
THIS BILL THAT WOULD BE

04:38:17.680 --> 04:38:18.648
APPRECIATED. CAN YOU SPEAK TO

04:38:18.715 --> 04:38:20.717
THE FACT THAT MEMBERS WHO ARE

04:38:20.784 --> 04:38:22.152
FILING FOR CONGRESS CANNOT PUT

04:38:22.218 --> 04:38:23.887
ON THEIR BALLOT STATEMENT

04:38:23.953 --> 04:38:25.922
INCUMBENT WITH WHICH IS WITHIN

04:38:25.989 --> 04:38:27.924
THE BILL, AND THAT IS BASED ON

04:38:27.991 --> 04:38:29.726
PRIOR PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE

04:38:29.793 --> 04:38:31.194
USED AND THESE KINDS OF

04:38:31.261 --> 04:38:33.663
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY CANNOT USE

04:38:33.730 --> 04:38:35.465
INCUMBENT, THEY CAN ONLY USE

04:38:35.532 --> 04:38:36.966
THEIR TITLE OF A MEMBER OF

04:38:37.033 --> 04:38:38.268
CONGRESS OR U.S. REPRESENTATIVE.

04:38:38.334 --> 04:38:39.736
IS THERE IS THERE ANY FEAR AT

04:38:39.803 --> 04:38:43.706
ALL THAT THAT WOULD BE A

04:38:43.773 --> 04:38:44.874
VIOLATION OF THE FIRST

04:38:44.941 --> 04:38:49.512
AMENDMENT? I WOULD DEFER. NÓ. I

04:38:49.579 --> 04:38:52.082
WOULD SAY ALSO, THIS IS PAST

04:38:52.148 --> 04:38:54.150
PRACTICE. AND AS THE CHAIR

04:38:54.217 --> 04:38:56.686
MENTIONED, THE ANYONE CAN SAY

04:38:56.753 --> 04:38:59.289
THAT THEY WHAT THEIR TITLE IS IN

04:38:59.355 --> 04:39:03.893
THE IN THE BALLOT LABEL. WITHIN

04:39:03.960 --> 04:39:07.063
THIS BILL. TWO, IT STATES THAT

04:39:07.130 --> 04:39:10.333
THIS WAS THAT THE MAPS WERE

04:39:10.400 --> 04:39:12.135
CREATED AND SUBMITTED TO THE

04:39:12.202 --> 04:39:15.805
ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE AND PREPARED

04:39:15.872 --> 04:39:20.910
BY US HERE. BECAUSE OF THE KCRA

04:39:20.977 --> 04:39:21.878
REPORT, THE MAPS WERE DONE BY

04:39:21.945 --> 04:39:24.114
THE D TRIPLE C. IS THAT AN

04:39:24.180 --> 04:39:26.516
ACCURATE STATEMENT? WERE THE

04:39:26.583 --> 04:39:30.553
MAPS CREATED BY THE D TRIPLE C?

04:39:30.620 --> 04:39:32.355
I DON'T KNOW. PERSONALLY. I KNOW

04:39:32.422 --> 04:39:33.690
THAT THEY WERE PUBLICLY

04:39:33.756 --> 04:39:35.458
SUBMITTED, AND THEN THE

04:39:35.525 --> 04:39:37.627
LEGISLATURE LOOKED AT THEM AND

04:39:37.694 --> 04:39:39.896
REVIEWED THEM CAREFULLY FOR

04:39:39.963 --> 04:39:50.006
LEGAL COMPLIANCE. THANK YOU. ANY

04:39:50.073 --> 04:39:51.107
OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

04:39:51.174 --> 04:39:54.277
OR COMMENTS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:39:54.344 --> 04:39:55.979
BERMAN. YEAH, I'LL MAKE SOME

04:39:56.045 --> 04:39:57.313
COMMENTS. I WAS GOING TO MAKE AT

04:39:57.380 --> 04:39:59.716
AT THE END OF MY PRESENTATION,

04:39:59.782 --> 04:40:00.383
BUT DIDN'T IN THE TO SAVE

04:40:00.450 --> 04:40:02.919
EVERYONE SOME TIME. BUT IT WAS

04:40:02.986 --> 04:40:04.721
SAID BY THE VICE CHAIR OF THE

04:40:04.787 --> 04:40:05.955
COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS NO

04:40:06.022 --> 04:40:07.590
EMERGENCY, AND I WOULD URGE

04:40:07.657 --> 04:40:10.493
EVERYBODY TO WAKE UP. IF YOU

04:40:10.560 --> 04:40:12.061
DON'T THINK THAT OUR DEMOCRACY

04:40:12.128 --> 04:40:14.597
IS CURRENTLY UNDER ATTACK, IF

04:40:14.664 --> 04:40:17.000
YOU DON'T THINK THAT THE

04:40:17.066 --> 04:40:17.634
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

04:40:17.700 --> 04:40:19.102
GETTING ELECTIONS, GETTING

04:40:19.169 --> 04:40:20.904
DEMOCRACY ADVICE FROM VLADIMIR

04:40:20.970 --> 04:40:22.772
PUTIN ISN'T AN EMERGENCY AND

04:40:22.839 --> 04:40:24.841
THEN BRAGGING ABOUT IT ON

04:40:24.908 --> 04:40:26.676
NATIONAL TV. IF YOU DON'T THINK

04:40:26.743 --> 04:40:28.645
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

04:40:28.711 --> 04:40:29.145
STATES CALLING ELECTIONS

04:40:29.212 --> 04:40:30.547
OFFICIALS IN GEORGIA AND ASKING

04:40:30.613 --> 04:40:32.081
THOSE REPUBLICAN ELECTIONS

04:40:32.148 --> 04:40:34.250
OFFICIALS TO FIND HIM 12,000

04:40:34.317 --> 04:40:35.752
VOTES ISN'T AN EMERGENCY. IF YOU

04:40:35.818 --> 04:40:37.120
DON'T THINK THAT THIS PRESIDENT

04:40:37.187 --> 04:40:38.922
OF THE UNITED STATES WON'T

04:40:38.988 --> 04:40:41.057
CONTINUE TO ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY

04:40:41.124 --> 04:40:43.226
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF

04:40:43.293 --> 04:40:45.528
WE LET HIM, ISN'T AN EMERGENCY.

04:40:45.595 --> 04:40:47.564
YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. AND

04:40:47.630 --> 04:40:49.365
WHETHER IT'S FOR YOUR SIDE OR MY

04:40:49.432 --> 04:40:52.569
SIDE DOESN'T MATTER. THIS IS OUR

04:40:52.635 --> 04:40:54.103
DEMOCRACY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:40:54.170 --> 04:40:55.138
AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

04:40:55.205 --> 04:40:57.640
STATES HAS SHOWN ZERO INTEREST

04:40:57.707 --> 04:40:59.375
IN DEMOCRACY. HE HAS SHOWN ONLY

04:40:59.442 --> 04:41:01.911
INTEREST IN POWER. AND IF

04:41:01.978 --> 04:41:03.346
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T FINALLY PUSH

04:41:03.413 --> 04:41:07.383
BACK ON THESE CONSTANT ATTEMPTS

04:41:07.450 --> 04:41:09.586
TO ERODE OUR SOCIETAL NORMS, TO

04:41:09.652 --> 04:41:12.555
ERODE OUR DEMOCRACY, WE WON'T

04:41:12.622 --> 04:41:13.957
HAVE AN AMERICA TO FIGHT FOR IN

04:41:14.023 --> 04:41:15.625
THE FUTURE. AND WE'RE THERE. I

04:41:15.692 --> 04:41:17.360
DON'T LIKE TO BE HYPERBOLIC.

04:41:17.427 --> 04:41:19.429
IT'S NOT REALLY MY STYLE. BUT IF

04:41:19.495 --> 04:41:21.931
YOU DON'T THINK THAT THE FATE OF

04:41:21.998 --> 04:41:24.767
OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE, WHEN

04:41:24.834 --> 04:41:26.135
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

04:41:26.202 --> 04:41:28.271
STATES DEMANDS SAYS THAT HE'S

04:41:28.338 --> 04:41:29.706
ENTITLED TO FIVE REPUBLICAN

04:41:29.772 --> 04:41:32.208
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS, AND

04:41:32.275 --> 04:41:34.043
UNLIKE THOSE REPUBLICAN

04:41:34.110 --> 04:41:35.478
ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IN GEORGIA

04:41:35.545 --> 04:41:37.680
WHO HAD A SPINE AND A MORAL

04:41:37.747 --> 04:41:39.482
COMPASS AND SAID, NO, MR.

04:41:39.549 --> 04:41:40.984
PRESIDENT, THAT'S WRONG, AND WE

04:41:41.050 --> 04:41:43.052
ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. THAT

04:41:43.119 --> 04:41:44.654
DOESN'T EXIST IN THE REPUBLICAN

04:41:44.721 --> 04:41:46.756
PARTY IN 2025. THE ONLY ANSWER

04:41:46.823 --> 04:41:49.559
FROM REPUBLICANS IN 2025 IS YES,

04:41:49.626 --> 04:41:51.227
MR. PRESIDENT, HOW CAN I JUMP

04:41:51.294 --> 04:41:53.730
HIGHER? YES, MR. PRESIDENT, HOW

04:41:53.796 --> 04:41:56.666
CAN I BOW LOWER AT YOUR FEET? SO

04:41:56.733 --> 04:41:59.636
THERE IS NO CHECK. THERE IS NO

04:41:59.702 --> 04:42:01.271
CHECK ON THIS PRESIDENT OF THE

04:42:01.337 --> 04:42:02.405
UNITED STATES, ESPECIALLY WHEN

04:42:02.472 --> 04:42:04.674
HE'S GOT AN ABSOLUTELY COMPLIANT

04:42:04.741 --> 04:42:06.175
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND THE

04:42:06.242 --> 04:42:07.076
SENATE. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S

04:42:07.143 --> 04:42:09.445
TRYING TO KEEP INTO PERPETUITY

04:42:09.512 --> 04:42:10.380
BY RIGGING ELECTIONS IN TEXAS

04:42:10.446 --> 04:42:13.783
AND OTHER STATES. AND THAT'S

04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:18.021
WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING BACK ON IN

04:42:18.087 --> 04:42:18.655
CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE GOING TO

04:42:18.721 --> 04:42:20.990
PUT IT TO VOTERS AND GIVE

04:42:21.057 --> 04:42:21.891
CALIFORNIA VOTERS THE

04:42:21.958 --> 04:42:23.326
OPPORTUNITY. DO YOU WANT TO

04:42:23.393 --> 04:42:25.161
FIGHT BACK ON THESE POWER GRABS

04:42:25.228 --> 04:42:26.262
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

04:42:26.329 --> 04:42:28.264
REPUBLICANS IN OTHER STATES, WHO

04:42:28.331 --> 04:42:30.833
THEN MAKE DECISIONS THAT DESTROY

04:42:30.900 --> 04:42:32.669
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA, THAT

04:42:32.735 --> 04:42:35.004
RIP AWAY MEDI-CAL FROM 3.5

04:42:35.071 --> 04:42:36.406
MILLION CALIFORNIANS? AND WHAT

04:42:36.472 --> 04:42:37.674
DO OUR NINE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS

04:42:37.740 --> 04:42:40.176
MEMBERS DO? DO THEY DEFEND THEIR

04:42:40.243 --> 04:42:42.445
CONSTITUENTS? NO. WHEN THEY KNOW

04:42:42.512 --> 04:42:44.147
THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

04:42:44.213 --> 04:42:44.814
THEIR CONSTITUENTS ARE GOING TO

04:42:44.881 --> 04:42:46.649
LOSE HEALTH CARE, TENS OF

04:42:46.716 --> 04:42:47.750
THOUSANDS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS

04:42:47.817 --> 04:42:50.286
ARE GOING TO LOSE FOOD STAMPS,

04:42:50.353 --> 04:42:51.788
FREE AND REDUCED MEALS AT LUNCH.

04:42:51.854 --> 04:42:53.990
A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT AT

04:42:54.057 --> 04:42:55.825
SCHOOL, A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT

04:42:55.892 --> 04:42:56.759
GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE

04:42:56.826 --> 04:42:58.961
BEEN ABLE TO DEPEND ON, AND

04:42:59.028 --> 04:43:00.463
THOSE THINGS ARE BEING TAKEN

04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:02.632
AWAY. AND IF THAT DOESN'T SCARE

04:43:02.699 --> 04:43:03.766
THE HELL OUT OF YOU, I DON'T

04:43:03.833 --> 04:43:06.035
KNOW WHAT WILL. SO THE EMERGENCY

04:43:06.102 --> 04:43:09.706
IS HERE. IT'S AT 10:00. TEN

04:43:09.772 --> 04:43:12.909
ALARM FIRE. AND THAT'S WHAT

04:43:12.975 --> 04:43:15.411
WE'RE RESPONDING TO. AND WE NEED

04:43:15.478 --> 04:43:17.080
TO RESPOND TO TODAY AND TO THE

04:43:17.146 --> 04:43:19.482
POINT OF THE TIMING. I THINK THE

04:43:19.549 --> 04:43:20.983
TIMING SUCKS. BUT WHEN WE BROKE

04:43:21.050 --> 04:43:21.984
FOR RECESS, TEXANS WEREN'T

04:43:22.051 --> 04:43:24.053
TALKING ABOUT RIGGING THEIR

04:43:24.120 --> 04:43:27.490
ELECTION FOR THE NEXT DECADE.

04:43:27.557 --> 04:43:29.926
VOTERS ARE GOING TO HAVE 74 DAYS

04:43:29.992 --> 04:43:32.395
TO REVIEW THESE MAPS. VOTERS.

04:43:32.462 --> 04:43:33.930
CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE GOING TO

04:43:33.996 --> 04:43:36.065
GET THE CHANCE TO VOTE ON THESE

04:43:36.132 --> 04:43:39.369
MAPS, AND CALIFORNIA VOTERS WILL

04:43:39.435 --> 04:43:40.002
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE ENACT

04:43:40.069 --> 04:43:43.072
THESE MAPS OR NOT. I CAN'T THINK

04:43:43.139 --> 04:43:44.340
OF A MORE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS

04:43:44.407 --> 04:43:46.476
THAN THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHY MY

04:43:46.542 --> 04:43:47.276
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ARE SO

04:43:47.343 --> 04:43:48.711
AFRAID OF THE VOTERS OF

04:43:48.778 --> 04:43:50.680
CALIFORNIA. SO LET'S GET IT.

04:43:50.747 --> 04:43:52.749
LET'S PUT IT. LET'S PUT IT TO

04:43:52.815 --> 04:43:54.817
THE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. LET'S

04:43:54.884 --> 04:43:55.518
GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO

04:43:55.585 --> 04:43:56.519
DECIDE. ARE THEY TIRED OF

04:43:56.586 --> 04:43:58.121
PRESIDENT TRUMP ATTACKING

04:43:58.187 --> 04:43:59.422
CALIFORNIA OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

04:43:59.489 --> 04:44:00.823
ARE THEY TIRED OF REPUBLICAN

04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:03.393
CONGRESS MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA

04:44:03.459 --> 04:44:04.494
CONSTANTLY BOWING DOWN TO THE

04:44:04.560 --> 04:44:05.962
PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF STANDING UP

04:44:06.028 --> 04:44:08.164
FOR THEM OR NOT? AND THAT'S THE

04:44:08.231 --> 04:44:09.132
CHANCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

04:44:09.198 --> 04:44:11.134
GET. AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF

04:44:11.200 --> 04:44:12.535
THIS PROCESS. THAT'S THE BEAUTY

04:44:12.602 --> 04:44:14.003
OF THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY'RE

04:44:14.070 --> 04:44:15.805
GOING TO HAVE ON NOVEMBER 4TH.

04:44:15.872 --> 04:44:17.774
SO I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE,

04:44:17.840 --> 04:44:19.008
THE ELECTIONS CHAIR IN THE

04:44:19.075 --> 04:44:20.743
SENATE, FOR BRINGING FORWARD

04:44:20.810 --> 04:44:21.544
THIS BILL. I WANT TO THANK MY

04:44:21.611 --> 04:44:23.246
COLLEAGUE, THE CHAIR OF THE

04:44:23.312 --> 04:44:24.013
ASSEMBLY, FOR JOINT AUTHORING

04:44:24.080 --> 04:44:25.848
IT, AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT.

04:44:25.915 --> 04:44:29.051
I'LL MOVE THE BILL. SECOND, WE

04:44:29.118 --> 04:44:29.852
HAVE A MOTION AND WE HAVE A

04:44:29.919 --> 04:44:33.656
SECOND. CAN I GET ONE MORE

04:44:33.723 --> 04:44:36.759
QUESTION? I DO OKAY. WELL, MORE

04:44:36.826 --> 04:44:40.530
OF A COMMENT. YOU KNOW, THE MAIN

04:44:40.596 --> 04:44:43.399
REASON WHY I TRULY BROUGHT UP

04:44:43.466 --> 04:44:44.867
URGENCY AND WHY IT'S SO VITAL

04:44:44.934 --> 04:44:46.936
AND SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE I

04:44:47.003 --> 04:44:49.305
AGREE. WHEN WE ALL TOOK A BREAK

04:44:49.372 --> 04:44:50.840
HERE, THIS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT

04:44:50.907 --> 04:44:52.675
WE ALL THOUGHT ABOUT, WASN'T

04:44:52.742 --> 04:44:54.544
SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

04:44:54.610 --> 04:44:57.513
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY, ANY OF US

04:44:57.580 --> 04:44:58.114
WANT TO BE HERE GOING THROUGH

04:44:58.181 --> 04:45:01.818
THIS PROCESS, BUT WITH URGENCY

04:45:01.884 --> 04:45:04.420
AND THE WAY THIS HAS BEEN DONE

04:45:04.487 --> 04:45:07.123
AND THE WAY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:11.260
IT. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA CAN

04:45:11.327 --> 04:45:13.729
SEE RIGHT NOW THAT IF THEY

04:45:13.796 --> 04:45:16.265
WANTED US TO TAKE ON THE COST OF

04:45:16.332 --> 04:45:18.768
LIVING, INSURANCE, UTILITIES,

04:45:18.835 --> 04:45:20.336
EVERYTHING ELSE, CAN WE SPEAK TO

04:45:20.403 --> 04:45:23.840
THE URGENCY AND URGENCY THE BILL

04:45:23.906 --> 04:45:26.309
IS? SO ANYTHING. EXCUSE ME,

04:45:26.375 --> 04:45:28.144
EXCUSE ME. WE HAVE A MOTION AND

04:45:28.211 --> 04:45:29.812
WE HAVE A SECOND. AND SO FOR

04:45:29.879 --> 04:45:31.581
THAT REASON, IN ALL INTENTS AND

04:45:31.647 --> 04:45:34.517
PURPOSES, ENDS DEBATE FOR MY 15

04:45:34.584 --> 04:45:35.918
MINUTES. CAN I JUST YOU'RE

04:45:35.985 --> 04:45:37.186
YOU'RE JUST ABOUT. YOU GOT ONE

04:45:37.253 --> 04:45:39.222
MORE MINUTE. OKAY. I'LL DO IT IN

04:45:39.288 --> 04:45:40.623
ONE MINUTE. IT TELLS US THAT THE

04:45:40.690 --> 04:45:42.859
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN MOVE AT

04:45:42.925 --> 04:45:43.392
LIGHTNING SPEED TO HANDLE

04:45:43.459 --> 04:45:44.227
SOMETHING WHEN IT'S FOR

04:45:44.293 --> 04:45:45.695
POLITICAL GAIN, BUT WE CAN'T DO

04:45:45.761 --> 04:45:47.797
IT TO TAKE ON THE COST OF

04:45:47.864 --> 04:45:48.865
LIVING, TO TAKE ON UTILITIES, TO

04:45:48.931 --> 04:45:50.066
TAKE ON EVERYTHING ELSE. THANK

04:45:50.132 --> 04:45:51.868
YOU FOR NOT SPEAKING TO THIS

04:45:51.934 --> 04:45:53.769
BILL AT ALL, AND I'M SORRY THAT

04:45:53.836 --> 04:45:54.937
WE CAN FIND URGENCY ON THIS

04:45:55.004 --> 04:45:56.839
BILL, BUT WE CAN'T FIND URGENCY

04:45:56.906 --> 04:45:58.107
TO TAKE ON SO MANY ISSUES HERE

04:45:58.174 --> 04:45:59.609
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

04:45:59.675 --> 04:46:01.844
I'M SORRY, BUT WHEN YOUR FAMILY

04:46:01.911 --> 04:46:03.112
WOULD BE SITTING IN THE MORGUE

04:46:03.179 --> 04:46:05.047
RIGHT NOW, I THINK TEN MORE

04:46:05.114 --> 04:46:05.982
MINUTES, I THINK YOU WOULD ASK

04:46:06.048 --> 04:46:07.683
FOR MORE. I WISH THE REPUBLICAN

04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:09.151
CONGRESS HADN'T SEEN THIS. I

04:46:09.218 --> 04:46:10.920
HAVEN'T SEEN THIS. ALL RIGHT. SO

04:46:10.987 --> 04:46:11.554
BRINGING THIS CONTROL BACK HERE

04:46:11.621 --> 04:46:13.990
TO THE CHAIR, WE HAVE A MOTION

04:46:14.056 --> 04:46:15.791
AND WE HAVE A SECOND ON SB 280.

04:46:15.858 --> 04:46:17.126
SENATOR CERVANTES, YOU MAY

04:46:17.193 --> 04:46:18.528

OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE TODAY. I

04:46:22.632 --> 04:46:24.667
WANT TO MAKE A FEW STATEMENTS

04:46:24.734 --> 04:46:26.769
BECAUSE OF WHAT I HEARD FROM.

04:46:26.836 --> 04:46:29.839

TAPIA. YOU KNOW, EARLIER THIS

04:46:36.913 --> 04:46:38.948
YEAR YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

04:46:39.015 --> 04:46:42.351
VOTE ON A INDEPENDENT,

04:46:42.418 --> 04:46:45.321
NONPARTISAN COMMISSION THROUGH A

04:46:45.388 --> 04:46:46.656
BILL BY YOUR OWN COLLEAGUE,

04:46:46.722 --> 04:46:49.859
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SORIA. AND YET

04:46:49.926 --> 04:46:52.795
YOU BOTH VOTED AGAINST IT TWICE.

04:46:52.862 --> 04:46:55.298
SO THAT IS THE HYPOCRISY. MADAM

04:46:55.364 --> 04:46:56.732
CHAIR. WE'VE BEEN ATTACKED ON

04:46:56.799 --> 04:46:58.801
THIS TWICE. LET'S LET THIS

04:46:58.868 --> 04:47:00.369
SENATOR COMPLETE HER CLOTHES.

04:47:00.436 --> 04:47:02.038

CLOTHES. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

04:47:08.878 --> 04:47:13.182
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

VOTERS TO HAVE A DIRECT SAY IN

04:47:15.818 --> 04:47:19.422
THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR

04:47:19.488 --> 04:47:22.258
COUNTRY. THIS IS A RESPONSE TO

04:47:22.325 --> 04:47:25.494
TRUMP'S ELECTION RIGGING SCHEME,

04:47:25.561 --> 04:47:29.065
WHICH IS AN EMERGENCY FOR OUR

04:47:29.131 --> 04:47:33.369
DEMOCRACY. SB 280 IS TO HOLD AN

04:47:33.436 --> 04:47:35.972
ELECTION TO GIVE VOTERS,

04:47:36.038 --> 04:47:39.141
CALIFORNIA VOTERS A VOICE THAT

04:47:39.208 --> 04:47:42.378
TEXAS REPUBLICANS ARE DENYING

04:47:42.445 --> 04:47:47.516
TEXANS LET CALIFORNIANS VOTE AND

04:47:47.583 --> 04:47:51.053
HAVE A SAY AT THE BALLOT BOX. I

04:47:51.120 --> 04:47:51.887
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE.

04:47:51.954 --> 04:47:54.223
THANK YOU. AND I'M SORRY I DID

04:47:54.290 --> 04:47:55.791
MISS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT,

04:47:55.858 --> 04:47:57.326
WHO HAD A COMMENT HE'D LIKE TO

04:47:57.393 --> 04:47:58.794
MAKE. SO I'M GOING TO OPEN THE

04:47:58.861 --> 04:48:00.930
FLOOR TO HIM. THANK YOU. THANK

04:48:00.997 --> 04:48:02.098
YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT.

04:48:02.164 --> 04:48:03.699
TRY TO BE VERY BRIEF HERE. I

04:48:03.766 --> 04:48:06.869
TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THIS REAL

04:48:06.936 --> 04:48:09.105
ISSUE IS ABOUT HOW DO WE SET THE

04:48:09.171 --> 04:48:11.207
RULES OF THE GAME TO DECIDE WHO

04:48:11.273 --> 04:48:11.874
CONTROLS THE POWER OF THE

04:48:11.941 --> 04:48:16.212
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THE OLD

04:48:16.278 --> 04:48:18.047
WAY IS BEING CHANGED AT THE

04:48:18.114 --> 04:48:19.148
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL? I

04:48:19.215 --> 04:48:20.950
TALKED ABOUT THAT IN MY EARLIER

04:48:21.017 --> 04:48:21.884
COMMENTS, AND SO I WON'T REPEAT

04:48:21.951 --> 04:48:23.853
ALL THAT. BUT I DO THINK THERE'S

04:48:23.919 --> 04:48:25.121
ONE THING THAT REALLY MERITS

04:48:25.187 --> 04:48:27.056
REPEATING, BECAUSE BETWEEN NOW

04:48:27.123 --> 04:48:29.291
AND NOVEMBER, WE WILL GET AN

04:48:29.358 --> 04:48:30.660
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WHAT I'M

04:48:30.726 --> 04:48:33.129
GOING TO TALK ABOUT, AND THAT

04:48:33.195 --> 04:48:36.799
AUTOCRATS USE FOUR MAJOR

04:48:36.866 --> 04:48:41.237
TECHNIQUES TO AUTOCRATS USE FOUR

04:48:41.303 --> 04:48:43.606
MAJOR TECHNIQUES TO WEAKEN

04:48:43.673 --> 04:48:45.307
DEMOCRACY AND DO THESE KINDS OF

04:48:45.374 --> 04:48:46.876
THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN

04:48:46.942 --> 04:48:48.944
TEXAS. AND THAT IS THEY'RE JUST

04:48:49.011 --> 04:48:51.147
DECEITFUL ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

04:48:51.213 --> 04:48:55.151
ONE, TWO, THEY PRACTICE LOTS OF

04:48:55.217 --> 04:48:56.919
INTIMIDATION. I WOULD OFFER THE

04:48:56.986 --> 04:48:58.821
LAUGHTER AND THE JEERING, ETC,

04:48:58.888 --> 04:49:01.290
THAT TOOK PLACE IN THIS HEARING.

04:49:01.357 --> 04:49:02.191
IN THE FIRST, AS WE DISCUSSED,

04:49:02.258 --> 04:49:04.093
THE FIRST BILL IS JUST AN

04:49:04.160 --> 04:49:07.029
EXAMPLE OF THAT DIDN'T COME UP

04:49:07.096 --> 04:49:08.030
FROM THE OTHER SIDE ANYWHERE

04:49:08.097 --> 04:49:09.832
NEAR LIKE IT CAME FROM THAT. THE

04:49:09.899 --> 04:49:11.634
THIRD THING IS THE

04:49:11.701 --> 04:49:13.135
MILITARIZATION OF CIVILIAN LIFE

04:49:13.202 --> 04:49:15.237
IS PART OF THIS CREATE THIS

04:49:15.304 --> 04:49:17.773
CRISIS MENTALITY. BUT THE FOURTH

04:49:17.840 --> 04:49:19.675
ONE THAT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT

04:49:19.742 --> 04:49:22.445
IS TO KEEP RAISING ISSUES, TO

04:49:22.511 --> 04:49:24.680
DEFLECT US FROM THE REAL ISSUE.

04:49:24.747 --> 04:49:27.483
THIS IS ABOUT CHANGING THE

04:49:27.550 --> 04:49:31.821
RULES, RIGGING THE GAME SO THAT

04:49:31.887 --> 04:49:33.222
ONE SIDE HAS AN ADVANTAGE, AND

04:49:33.289 --> 04:49:34.724
KEEPING THE RESOURCES AND THE

04:49:34.790 --> 04:49:36.092
POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

04:49:36.158 --> 04:49:38.594
AND THAT TECHNIQUE IS TO DEFLECT

04:49:38.661 --> 04:49:41.263
US WITH, WELL, WHY IS THIS MORE

04:49:41.330 --> 04:49:42.732
URGENT THAN THAT? WHY IS THIS

04:49:42.798 --> 04:49:45.134
AND WHY DIDN'T WE DO IT LIKE THE

04:49:45.201 --> 04:49:46.936
OLD COMMISSION? IT'S EVERY TRICK

04:49:47.002 --> 04:49:49.839
IN THE BOOK AND IT IS KABUKI

04:49:49.905 --> 04:49:51.207
THEATER, AS I SAID BEFORE. BUT I

04:49:51.273 --> 04:49:53.442
WANT TO REPEAT THAT WE ALL HAVE

04:49:53.509 --> 04:49:55.845
TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR AN

04:49:55.911 --> 04:49:58.114
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF THIS BETWEEN

04:49:58.180 --> 04:50:00.082
NOW AND NOVEMBER, AND WE HAVE TO

04:50:00.149 --> 04:50:01.717
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO EDUCATE

04:50:01.784 --> 04:50:03.819
THE PUBLIC. AND THANK YOU VERY

04:50:03.886 --> 04:50:05.688
MUCH FOR LETTING ME MAKE THAT

04:50:05.755 --> 04:50:06.989
POINT. BEFORE WE THANK YOU AND

04:50:07.056 --> 04:50:09.325
MY APOLOGIES FOR MISSING THAT.

SO THERE WAS A MOTION AND A

04:50:11.060 --> 04:50:13.229
SECOND, AND THE SENATOR HAS

04:50:13.295 --> 04:50:15.798
CLOSED. SO THE MOTION IS TO Dð

04:50:15.865 --> 04:50:17.933

DANCE AROUND THE ISSUE HERE. IF

04:52:12.047 --> 04:52:13.749
CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS HAD OUR

04:52:13.816 --> 04:52:16.318
WAY, THE MIDTERMS WOULD CONTINUE

04:52:16.385 --> 04:52:19.221
AS THEY ARE WITH THE MAP DRAWN

04:52:19.288 --> 04:52:20.756
BY OUR STATE'S INDEPENDENT

CALIFORNIA CITIZENS

04:52:22.157 --> 04:52:22.925
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. I

04:52:22.992 --> 04:52:25.027
THINK WE NEED TO. WE AGREE ON

04:52:25.094 --> 04:52:26.328
THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH

04:52:26.395 --> 04:52:28.998
FOR THE THIS PRESIDENT OR FOR

04:52:29.064 --> 04:52:30.666
REPUBLICANS FOLLOWING HIS

04:52:30.733 --> 04:52:33.636
COMMANDS IN TEXAS AND DC. WE

04:52:33.702 --> 04:52:35.471
WEREN'T PLANNING ON

04:52:35.537 --> 04:52:36.939
REDISTRICTING UNTIL THEY MADE

04:52:37.006 --> 04:52:39.675
ATTEMPTS TO RIG THE 2026

04:52:39.742 --> 04:52:42.511
ELECTION BY STACKING THE DECK IN

04:52:42.578 --> 04:52:44.747
OTHER STATES. WE DIDN'T START

04:52:44.813 --> 04:52:46.882
THIS, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO

04:52:46.949 --> 04:52:50.052
ROLL OVER. THIS BILL LAYS OUT

04:52:50.119 --> 04:52:53.022
NEW CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS

04:52:53.088 --> 04:52:56.458
ONLY. ONLY IF VOTERS PASS ACA

04:52:56.525 --> 04:52:59.461
EIGHT. IF VOTERS APPROVE THE NEW

04:52:59.528 --> 04:53:00.796
MAP, THE INDEPENDENT

04:53:00.863 --> 04:53:01.997
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WILL

04:53:02.064 --> 04:53:04.466
CONTINUE ITS MISSION AFTER THE

04:53:04.533 --> 04:53:07.636
2030 CENSUS. IF CALIFORNIA

04:53:07.703 --> 04:53:10.606
VOTERS APPROVE THIS PLAN, THE

04:53:10.673 --> 04:53:13.909
TEMPORARY MAPS ONLY HAPPEN IF DC

04:53:13.976 --> 04:53:15.277
REPUBLICANS AND THE REPUBLICAN

04:53:15.344 --> 04:53:18.447
LED STATES PUSH THROUGH MID

04:53:18.514 --> 04:53:21.417
MID-DECADE. PARTIZAN MAPS FIRST.

04:53:21.483 --> 04:53:23.419
UNLIKE TEXAS, WHICH IS FORCING

04:53:23.485 --> 04:53:25.421
MAPS ON THEIR VOTERS, WERE

04:53:25.487 --> 04:53:27.856
TAKING OURS FOR THEIR APPROVAL.

04:53:27.923 --> 04:53:30.125
WE'RE ASKING OURS FOR THEIR

04:53:30.192 --> 04:53:31.527
APPROVAL. THERE IS NOTHING MORE

04:53:31.593 --> 04:53:32.928
DEMOCRATIC THAN LETTING

04:53:32.995 --> 04:53:35.998
CALIFORNIA VOTERS DECIDE. UNLIKE

04:53:36.065 --> 04:53:38.701
THE MAP PROPOSED IN TEXAS, THE

04:53:38.767 --> 04:53:41.904
MAP IN AB 604 RESPECTS

04:53:41.971 --> 04:53:43.672
CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL

04:53:43.739 --> 04:53:44.773
REQUIREMENT FOR MAINTAINING

04:53:44.840 --> 04:53:46.976
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST. WITH

04:53:47.042 --> 04:53:49.812
THIS BILL, THERE IS LESS BREAKUP

04:53:49.878 --> 04:53:52.314
OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WITH

04:53:52.381 --> 04:53:54.350
THIS BILL, WE SEEK THE PUBLIC'S

04:53:54.416 --> 04:53:58.520
INPUT. THE VOTERS WILL DECIDE.

04:53:58.587 --> 04:54:00.055
SO IF OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES

04:54:00.122 --> 04:54:03.192
IN CALIFORNIA WANT THIS TO STOP,

04:54:03.258 --> 04:54:05.661
THEY DON'T NEED US TO DO IT.

04:54:05.728 --> 04:54:07.429
THEY CAN CONVINCE THE REPUBLICAN

04:54:07.496 --> 04:54:09.598
COLLEAGUES IN TEXAS AND DC TO

04:54:09.665 --> 04:54:12.901
STOP TRYING TO RIG THE 2026

04:54:12.968 --> 04:54:15.504
ELECTIONS, AND THEY CAN ASK

04:54:15.571 --> 04:54:16.472
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS TO

04:54:16.538 --> 04:54:18.774
PASS THE REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL TO

04:54:18.841 --> 04:54:20.776
MAKE MIDTERM REDISTRICTING

04:54:20.843 --> 04:54:23.045
ILLEGAL, TO FINALLY CREATE A

04:54:23.112 --> 04:54:25.147
SYSTEM WHERE EVERY STATE USES A

04:54:25.214 --> 04:54:28.083
FAIR, INDEPENDENT DISTRICTING

04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:32.221
SYSTEM. AGAIN, COLLEAGUES, THE

04:54:32.287 --> 04:54:34.723
CHOICE IS TO STAND DOWN OR

04:54:34.790 --> 04:54:36.992
SUPPORT A FAIR SYSTEM FOR EVERY

04:54:37.059 --> 04:54:40.896
STATE. THAT'S HOW THIS ENDS.

04:54:40.963 --> 04:54:42.264
UNTIL THIS PRESIDENT, HIS

04:54:42.331 --> 04:54:44.199
FOLLOWERS STOP TRYING TO RIG THE

04:54:44.266 --> 04:54:45.968
ELECTIONS. WE WON'T. AND WE

04:54:46.035 --> 04:54:48.470
CAN'T SIT ON OUR HANDS. WHAT

04:54:48.537 --> 04:54:50.272
HAPPENS NEXT YEAR IS UP TO THE

04:54:50.339 --> 04:54:52.207

REDISTRICTING PACKAGE. IT

04:55:53.769 --> 04:55:55.104
REPRESENTS A SENSIBLE AND IN

04:55:55.170 --> 04:55:58.874
FACT, POSSIBLY THE ONLY PATH FOR

04:55:58.941 --> 04:56:00.809
CALIFORNIA TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST

04:56:00.876 --> 04:56:02.277
TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO STEAL THE

HAVE CHOSEN THIS PATH, IT'S NOT

04:56:22.931 --> 04:56:25.100
THE CLEANEST, EASIEST WAY TO DO

04:56:25.167 --> 04:56:27.903
THINGS. WE ARE PROUD THAT

04:56:27.970 --> 04:56:29.104

04:57:13.382 --> 04:57:15.417
ADDITIONAL CRITERIA OF IMPROVING

04:57:15.484 --> 04:57:17.653
PARTIZAN GAINS IN RESPONSE TO

04:57:17.719 --> 04:57:19.555

REDISTRICTING USING OBJECTIVE

METRICS THE DISTRICTS MAINTAIN

04:57:25.727 --> 04:57:28.430
AND EVEN IN SOME CASES, IMPROVED

04:57:28.497 --> 04:57:30.332
DISTRICT COMPACTNESS COMPARED TO

04:57:30.399 --> 04:57:32.868
THE EXISTING COMMISSION MAPS.

04:57:32.935 --> 04:57:33.869
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED

04:57:33.936 --> 04:57:35.504
ABOUT SPLITTING UP CITIES, IT

04:57:35.571 --> 04:57:37.439
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE MAPS IN

04:57:37.506 --> 04:57:40.409

04:57:40.475 --> 04:57:42.778
THE CURRENT COMMISSION PLAN THAT

GAINS WITH NO CONSIDERATION OF

04:57:55.157 --> 04:57:57.259
THE STATE'S RESIDENTS. THEIR

PROPOSED MAP DOESN'T EVEN

04:57:58.193 --> 04:57:59.728
CONSIDER COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST

04:57:59.795 --> 04:58:02.264
OR POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS

04:58:02.331 --> 04:58:04.833
SPLITTING 142 CITIES, MORE THAN

04:58:04.900 --> 04:58:06.535
DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF CITIES

04:58:06.602 --> 04:58:08.070
COMPARED TO THE CALIFORNIA MAP

04:58:08.136 --> 04:58:09.938

REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF

CALIFORNIA, BUT THE PROPOSED

04:58:51.913 --> 04:58:54.049
RATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE

04:58:54.116 --> 04:58:55.183
ANTI-DEMOCRATIC ACTIONS OF THIS

04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:57.786
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION, AB 604

04:58:57.853 --> 04:58:59.454

AN OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE IN

04:59:04.226 --> 04:59:05.560
NOVEMBER WHETHER THEY SUPPORT

04:59:05.627 --> 04:59:07.362
NEWLY DRAWN MAPS TO ELECT

04:59:07.429 --> 04:59:08.497
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES

04:59:08.563 --> 04:59:10.332
THAT WILL STAND UP AGAINST

04:59:10.399 --> 04:59:12.334
THREATS TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

04:59:12.401 --> 04:59:13.635
CALIFORNIANS AND ALL AMERICANS

04:59:13.702 --> 04:59:16.038
ARE FACING AN ENDLESS CYCLE OF

04:59:16.104 --> 04:59:17.406
WORRY UNDER THIS RECKLESS

04:59:17.472 --> 04:59:19.241
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. AND THAT

04:59:19.308 --> 04:59:20.609
MEANS REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, NO

04:59:20.676 --> 04:59:23.211
PARTY PREFERENCE. AMERICANS AND

04:59:23.278 --> 04:59:24.579
CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING THIS

04:59:24.646 --> 04:59:26.148
WORRY. FAMILIES HAVE BEEN

04:59:26.214 --> 04:59:27.049
SEPARATED. IN MY DISTRICT ALONE,

04:59:27.115 --> 04:59:29.551
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES COMPLETELY

04:59:29.618 --> 04:59:31.586
TRAUMATIZED FOR THE OVERREACH OF

04:59:31.653 --> 04:59:33.221
THIS EGREGIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

04:59:33.288 --> 04:59:35.791
VITAL PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CUT.

04:59:35.857 --> 04:59:37.159
MEDICARE. WE HAVE ABOUT 6

04:59:37.225 --> 04:59:38.994
MILLION FOLKS ON MEDICARE HERE

04:59:39.061 --> 04:59:40.762
IN CALIFORNIA. OVER 3 MILLION OF

04:59:40.829 --> 04:59:42.597
THEM WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE

04:59:42.664 --> 04:59:43.965
MEDICARE CUTS IN OUR

04:59:44.032 --> 04:59:45.233
COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S EXACTLY

04:59:45.300 --> 04:59:47.669
WHY THIS MOMENT IS SO URGENT.

04:59:47.736 --> 04:59:49.504
OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE BETTER.

04:59:49.571 --> 04:59:50.806
AND FOR YOU, I DON'T KNOW,

04:59:50.872 --> 04:59:52.240
PERSONALLY, SEEING MY TEXAS

04:59:52.307 --> 04:59:54.076
COLLEAGUES BEING LOCKED UP,

04:59:54.142 --> 04:59:56.345
BEING THREATENED WITH THE FBI

04:59:56.411 --> 04:59:58.146
COMING AFTER THEM, BEING

04:59:58.213 --> 05:00:01.249
THREATENED TO REQUIRE THEM TO

05:00:01.316 --> 05:00:02.718
HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THEIR

05:00:02.784 --> 05:00:05.287
EVERY WAKING HOUR, JUST TO BE

05:00:05.354 --> 05:00:07.255
ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB IS REALLY

05:00:07.322 --> 05:00:09.991
AN EGREGIOUS CRIME, IN MY

05:00:10.058 --> 05:00:10.992
OPINION, TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT

05:00:11.059 --> 05:00:13.295
YOUR COMMUNITIES BUT STILL HAVE

05:00:13.362 --> 05:00:16.198
THIS HANGING OVER YOU. SO AB 604

05:00:16.264 --> 05:00:17.866
IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION THAT

05:00:17.933 --> 05:00:19.101
PROVIDES CALIFORNIA VOTERS WITH

05:00:19.167 --> 05:00:21.136
THE MEANS TO BALANCE THE SCALES.

05:00:21.203 --> 05:00:23.038
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE

05:00:23.105 --> 05:00:24.373
DISCUSSION HERE IN TESTIFYING IN

05:00:24.439 --> 05:00:27.676

VERY BRIEF. THE AB AB 604 IS

05:00:36.718 --> 05:00:38.653
OBVIOUSLY THE MAPS ACT. IT IS A

05:00:38.720 --> 05:00:41.823
LONG LIST OF CENSUS BLOCKS, BUT

05:00:41.890 --> 05:00:44.526
NONETHELESS, THAT IS SEEN

05:00:44.593 --> 05:00:46.027
THROUGH INTERACTIVE MAPS THAT

05:00:46.094 --> 05:00:49.598
WILL BE BE WIDELY AVAILABLE. AND

05:00:49.664 --> 05:00:52.134
MORE IMPORTANTLY AS SB 280,

05:00:52.200 --> 05:00:53.802
WHICH YOU JUST HAD THE HEARING

05:00:53.869 --> 05:00:56.405
ON, COMMANDS THAT THE VOTER

FEELING THAT THESE MAPS OVER THE

NEXT 74 DAYS WILL BE DISCUSSED

05:01:04.546 --> 05:01:06.581
WIDELY BY EVERYONE, AND SO IT IS

05:01:06.648 --> 05:01:08.316
UP TO THE PUBLIC. THESE MAPS

05:01:08.383 --> 05:01:11.219
ONLY GO INTO EFFECT IF TEXAS OR

05:01:11.286 --> 05:01:13.722
OTHER DISTRICTS DO MID-DECADE

05:01:13.789 --> 05:01:15.290
REDISTRICTING, AND IF OUR

05:01:15.357 --> 05:01:16.958
VOTERS, THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS,

05:01:17.025 --> 05:01:18.427
APPROVE THEM, PROBABLY THE MOST

05:01:18.493 --> 05:01:20.228
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS YOU CAN HAVE.

05:01:20.295 --> 05:01:21.630

I AM A EMPLOYEE OF THE CITY OF

05:04:50.805 --> 05:04:53.708
LOS ANGELES, ALTHOUGH I DO NOT

05:04:53.775 --> 05:04:54.843
SPEAK FOR THE CITY OF LOS

05:04:54.909 --> 05:04:55.810
ANGELES, NOR DO I SPEAK FOR MY

05:04:55.877 --> 05:04:57.679
UNIONS. I AM A MEMBER OF A

05:04:57.746 --> 05:04:59.014
UNION. ONE OF THE PRESENTERS

05:04:59.080 --> 05:05:00.782
HERE TODAY STATED THAT BECAUSE

05:05:00.849 --> 05:05:02.784
OF THE CUTS WE ARE LOSING, TO BE

05:05:02.851 --> 05:05:04.119
ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE

05:05:04.185 --> 05:05:06.388
CITY OF LA. WE ARE FACING A

05:05:06.454 --> 05:05:08.189
BUDGET CRISIS. WE ARE HAVING TO

05:05:08.256 --> 05:05:09.691
LAY OFF PEOPLE, BUT IT HAS

05:05:09.758 --> 05:05:11.092
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

05:05:11.159 --> 05:05:12.127
ADMINISTRATION. IT HAS TO DO

05:05:12.193 --> 05:05:14.629
WITH OUR POOR PLANNING OF OUR

05:05:14.696 --> 05:05:17.866
LEADERSHIPS AND LAWSUITS. SO ONE

05:05:17.932 --> 05:05:19.668
OF THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT A LOT

05:05:19.734 --> 05:05:21.703
OF REPUBLICANS HAVE WITH THIS

05:05:21.770 --> 05:05:23.571
MAP AND WITH WITH THE PROCESS OF

05:05:23.638 --> 05:05:25.340
DOING THE REDISTRICTING, IS THAT

05:05:25.407 --> 05:05:27.842
WE ARE LOSING REPRESENTATION.

05:05:27.909 --> 05:05:29.778
AND I DO KNOW, EVEN THOUGH I DO

05:05:29.844 --> 05:05:32.547
NOT AGREE WITH THE SUPERMAJORITY

05:05:32.614 --> 05:05:34.349
PARTY'S POLITICS, YOU'VE BEEN

05:05:34.416 --> 05:05:36.017
NOTHING BUT FAIR TO US. YOU'VE

05:05:36.084 --> 05:05:38.019
BEEN FAIR TO I CONSIDER MY

05:05:38.086 --> 05:05:38.620
REPRESENTATIVES, EVEN THOUGH

05:05:38.687 --> 05:05:39.788
THEY'RE NOT MY DISTRICT. YOU

05:05:39.854 --> 05:05:41.656
GIVE THEM AMPLE AMOUNT OF TIME

05:05:41.723 --> 05:05:43.024
AND ALLOWED THEM TO EXPRESS

05:05:43.091 --> 05:05:45.026
THEIR DISMAY WITH THIS AND ALLOW

05:05:45.093 --> 05:05:46.895
THEM TO ASK THEIR QUESTIONS. BUT

05:05:46.961 --> 05:05:48.496
BY PASSING THIS, AND I

05:05:48.563 --> 05:05:49.197
UNDERSTAND THE REASONS WHY

05:05:49.264 --> 05:05:50.732
YOU'RE DOING IT, BY PASSING

05:05:50.799 --> 05:05:52.467
THIS, YOU ARE LIMITING OUR

05:05:52.534 --> 05:05:54.335
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION. WE

05:05:54.402 --> 05:05:56.738
MAKE UP ABOUT 40%. AND I SAID

05:05:56.805 --> 05:05:57.872
THIS ALREADY IN. ANOTHER PERSON

05:05:57.939 --> 05:06:00.041
SAID IT. WE MAKE UP ABOUT 40% OF

05:06:00.108 --> 05:06:01.109
THE VOTING BLOC. I THINK WHAT

05:06:01.176 --> 05:06:03.645
THIS IS GOING TO DO IS LIMIT IT

05:06:03.712 --> 05:06:05.780
TO, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, 20%. SO

05:06:05.847 --> 05:06:06.247
IT'S GOING TO CUT OUR

05:06:06.314 --> 05:06:07.816
REPRESENTATION DOWN IN HALF. AND

05:06:07.882 --> 05:06:09.751
I DO KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT THAT.

05:06:09.818 --> 05:06:11.953
SO I THINK YOU AND I UNDERSTAND

05:06:12.020 --> 05:06:12.754
AGAIN WHY YOU'RE DOING IT, BUT I

05:06:12.821 --> 05:06:15.557
THINK YOU ALL COULD DO A LOT

05:06:15.623 --> 05:06:16.925
BETTER THAN THIS. SO AND AGAIN,

05:06:16.991 --> 05:06:17.926
THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY.

05:06:17.992 --> 05:06:20.161
AND I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME

05:06:20.228 --> 05:06:21.196
TO SPEAK AND THANK YOU, ALLOWING

05:06:21.262 --> 05:06:22.931
FOR EVERYBODY TO GIVE 30S. I

05:06:22.997 --> 05:06:24.766
KNOW IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

05:06:24.833 --> 05:06:26.668
HAPPEN, BUT I REALLY WISH THAT

05:06:26.735 --> 05:06:28.970
THAT WILL BECOME A TREND IN THIS

05:06:29.037 --> 05:06:29.604
LEGISLATURE WITH THE COMMITTEES.

05:06:29.671 --> 05:06:32.340
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:06:32.407 --> 05:06:34.442
ANYBODY ELSE IN THE ROOM THAT

05:06:34.509 --> 05:06:35.910
WOULD JUST LIKE TO COME TO THE

05:06:35.977 --> 05:06:45.520
MIC AND GIVE YOUR 32ND. HELLO,

05:06:45.587 --> 05:06:47.155
MY NAME IS PRIYA PATEL AND I

05:06:47.222 --> 05:06:49.290
STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS PIECE OF

05:06:49.357 --> 05:06:52.927
LEGISLATION. YOUR DUTY AS THIS

05:06:52.994 --> 05:06:55.430
STATE'S LEGISLATURE IS TO THE

05:06:55.497 --> 05:06:57.599
VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA NOT TO

05:06:57.665 --> 05:06:59.501
PERFORM RETALIATORY RESPONSES TO

05:06:59.567 --> 05:07:02.270
THE ACTIONS OF OTHER STATES. SO

05:07:02.337 --> 05:07:05.106
BY OVERRIDING OUR STATE

05:07:05.173 --> 05:07:07.709
CONSTITUTION, TO RETALIATE TO

05:07:07.776 --> 05:07:09.210
THE ACTIONS OF THE STATE OF

05:07:09.277 --> 05:07:11.913
TEXAS IS COMPLETELY DISREGARDING

05:07:11.980 --> 05:07:14.382
YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND THE

05:07:14.449 --> 05:07:16.284
REASON THAT YOU ARE ELECTED INTO

05:07:16.351 --> 05:07:20.588
OFFICE IS NOT TO SIT HERE AND

05:07:20.655 --> 05:07:22.056
30S. OKAY, WELL, I DON'T KNOW

05:07:22.123 --> 05:07:28.463
THAT THAT WAS 30S 37 NOW. OKAY.

05:07:28.530 --> 05:07:30.031
AND LET'S REFRAIN FROM THE

05:07:30.098 --> 05:07:31.800
APPLAUSE. THANK YOU. HELLO, MY

05:07:31.866 --> 05:07:33.368
NAME IS SHARON KAY. I WAS IN

05:07:33.434 --> 05:07:35.336
HERE EARLIER OPPOSING AS WELL.

05:07:35.403 --> 05:07:37.205
DROVE ALL THE WAY UP FROM

05:07:37.272 --> 05:07:39.407
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS MORNING

05:07:39.474 --> 05:07:40.875
TO COME UP AND OPPOSE. MY

05:07:40.942 --> 05:07:42.877
SENTIMENTS ARE THE SAME. WE ARE

05:07:42.944 --> 05:07:45.380
NOT. I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO

05:07:45.446 --> 05:07:46.514
TRUMP PROOF CALIFORNIA, BUT WE

05:07:46.581 --> 05:07:48.316
ARE CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA

05:07:48.383 --> 05:07:49.851
AND WE FEEL LIKE OUR VOICES

05:07:49.918 --> 05:07:51.553
SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING, NOT JUST

05:07:51.619 --> 05:07:53.021
SOMETHING TO FIGHT WHAT'S GOING

05:07:53.087 --> 05:07:55.924
ON IN ANOTHER STATE. SO I'M JUST

05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:57.859
HERE DRIVING ALL THE WAY UP HERE

05:07:57.926 --> 05:07:59.394
FROM 1:00 IN THE MORNING TO

05:07:59.460 --> 05:08:02.997
OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ALL

05:08:03.064 --> 05:08:06.301
RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL

05:08:06.367 --> 05:08:07.302
RIGHT. IS THAT EVERYBODY THEN?

05:08:07.368 --> 05:08:09.737
OKAY. SO WE WILL NOW BRING IT

05:08:09.804 --> 05:08:10.371
BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

05:08:10.438 --> 05:08:12.307
DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR

05:08:12.373 --> 05:08:13.775
QUESTIONS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:08:13.842 --> 05:08:15.343
BENNETT, JUST JUST ONE QUICK

05:08:15.410 --> 05:08:16.945
ONE. THIS BILL IS ON A TIGHT

05:08:17.011 --> 05:08:18.746
TIME FRAME. ALL ALL THREE BILLS

05:08:18.813 --> 05:08:19.948
ARE ON TIGHT TIME FRAMES. AND SO

05:08:20.014 --> 05:08:22.116
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US

05:08:22.183 --> 05:08:24.385
TO RECOGNIZE THAT MANY ATTEMPTS

05:08:24.452 --> 05:08:26.487
WILL BE MADE TO DELAY THINGS.

05:08:26.554 --> 05:08:27.956
AND THERE WILL BE ALL KINDS OF

05:08:28.022 --> 05:08:29.724
REASONS FOR WHY WE SHOULD DELAY.

05:08:29.791 --> 05:08:31.226
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD ALL CALL

05:08:31.292 --> 05:08:33.261
OUT THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR

05:08:33.328 --> 05:08:34.796
REASONS IS IF YOU HAVE A TIGHT

05:08:34.863 --> 05:08:35.864
TIME FRAME AND YOU CAN DELAY

05:08:35.930 --> 05:08:36.831
SOMETHING LONG ENOUGH, THAT'S A

05:08:36.898 --> 05:08:39.434
WAY TO DEFEAT THIS BILL AND THAT

05:08:39.500 --> 05:08:41.469
SIMPLY RATHER THAN IT'S A

05:08:41.536 --> 05:08:42.837
GENUINE ISSUE THAT'S BEING

05:08:42.904 --> 05:08:43.972
BROUGHT UP. IT'S AN ISSUE BEING

05:08:44.038 --> 05:08:45.840
BROUGHT UP FOR THE ULTERIOR

05:08:45.907 --> 05:08:50.678
MOTIVE OF ALLOWING THE AUTOCRATS

05:08:50.745 --> 05:08:52.413
TO WIN AND CHANGE THE RULES AND

05:08:52.480 --> 05:08:54.916
HAVE US NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND.

05:08:54.983 --> 05:08:59.988
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY. I'M

05:09:00.054 --> 05:09:00.955
SORRY. THERE'S TWO MORE PEOPLE

05:09:01.022 --> 05:09:02.824
THAT WERE WANTING TO HAVE

05:09:02.891 --> 05:09:03.958
OPPOSITION RECORDED. GO AHEAD

05:09:04.025 --> 05:09:06.661
AND TAKE YOUR 30S EACH, I

05:09:06.728 --> 05:09:08.563
APOLOGIZE. NO WORRIES. MY NAME

05:09:08.630 --> 05:09:10.198
IS JASMINE GRAY AND I'M A

05:09:10.265 --> 05:09:12.166
RESIDENT HERE IN SACRAMENTO, AND

05:09:12.233 --> 05:09:14.035
MY SENTIMENTS ARE THE SAME AS

05:09:14.102 --> 05:09:15.837
WHAT WAS EXPLAINED BEFORE IS

05:09:15.904 --> 05:09:18.640
THAT AS A AS A CITIZEN, AS A

05:09:18.706 --> 05:09:19.841
RESIDENT HERE, I DON'T THINK

05:09:19.908 --> 05:09:21.743
THAT OUR LAWS SHOULD BE LOOKING

05:09:21.809 --> 05:09:24.078
AT COUNTERING WHAT'S GOING ON IN

05:09:24.145 --> 05:09:25.914
ANOTHER STATE. IT SHOULD BE

05:09:25.980 --> 05:09:28.383
REFLECTIVE OF WHAT IS NEEDED

05:09:28.449 --> 05:09:30.118
HERE FOR THE RESIDENTS HERE. AND

05:09:30.184 --> 05:09:32.787
SO I WANT TO STRONGLY OPPOSE THE

05:09:32.854 --> 05:09:36.257
BILL. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS

05:09:36.324 --> 05:09:41.296
DIANA CHÁVEZ, AND AS A MINE

05:09:41.362 --> 05:09:43.564
REPUBLICAN MINORITY NOW HERE IN

05:09:43.631 --> 05:09:45.300
CALIFORNIA, I STRONGLY OPPOSE

05:09:45.366 --> 05:09:46.868
THIS BECAUSE I THINK MY VOICE IS

05:09:46.935 --> 05:09:49.270
BEING COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AS

05:09:49.337 --> 05:09:51.172
BEING A REPUBLICAN. IT SEEMS

05:09:51.239 --> 05:09:52.540
EVERYTHING WANTS TO GO

05:09:52.607 --> 05:09:53.808
DEMOCRATIC. AND SO I STRONGLY

05:09:53.875 --> 05:09:58.413
OPPOSE THIS REDISTRICTING. ANY

05:09:58.479 --> 05:10:00.715
OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM

05:10:00.782 --> 05:10:01.282
COMMITTEE MEMBERS? ASSEMBLY

05:10:01.349 --> 05:10:06.955
MEMBER? YES, I HAVE QUITE A FEW.

05:10:07.021 --> 05:10:08.790
SO I ACTUALLY JUST WANTED SOME

05:10:08.856 --> 05:10:11.259
CLARITY TO. IF YOU CAN ANSWER

05:10:11.326 --> 05:10:14.062
THIS, WHEN DID WE FIRST SEE THE

05:10:14.128 --> 05:10:16.564
MAPS AND WHEN WERE YOU GIVEN THE

05:10:16.631 --> 05:10:19.133
MAPS TO START DRAWING THESE

05:10:19.200 --> 05:10:23.538
LINES? AND I ASK IN THE MAIN

05:10:23.604 --> 05:10:25.773
REASON WHY I ASKED THAT IS

05:10:25.840 --> 05:10:26.374
BECAUSE THERE WAS A STATEMENT

05:10:26.441 --> 05:10:28.309
THAT WAS MADE THAT THESE

05:10:28.376 --> 05:10:31.646
CONGRESSIONAL MAPS HAVE FEWER.

05:10:31.713 --> 05:10:35.316
YOU STATED THAT THERE WERE FEWER

05:10:35.383 --> 05:10:38.920
SPLITS WITH THESE MAPS. IT IS MY

05:10:38.987 --> 05:10:39.988
UNDERSTANDING THAT AS OF LAST

05:10:40.054 --> 05:10:42.523
NIGHT AT 8:00, THAT THERE ARE

05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:44.726
MORE SPLITS NOW, AND THAT WAS

05:10:44.792 --> 05:10:46.561
COMPLETELY CHANGED. SO IF YOU

05:10:46.627 --> 05:10:48.663
WROTE YOUR TESTIMONY BEFORE 8

05:10:48.730 --> 05:10:49.998
P.M, THE ENTIRE MAPS ARE

05:10:50.064 --> 05:10:52.333
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I DID IT

05:10:52.400 --> 05:10:54.802
BASED ON THE MAPS RELEASED ON

05:10:54.869 --> 05:10:56.270
FRIDAY. ON FRIDAY, YEAH. OKAY,

05:10:56.337 --> 05:10:58.039
SO THE MAPS CHANGED LAST NIGHT

05:10:58.106 --> 05:11:00.908
AND NOW THERE ARE MORE SPLITS.

05:11:00.975 --> 05:11:02.710
AGAIN, THE MAPS WERE CHANGED AS

05:11:02.777 --> 05:11:05.613
OF YESTERDAY MORNING AT 8 A.M,

05:11:05.680 --> 05:11:07.448
AND IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF

05:11:07.515 --> 05:11:10.718
TWEAKS THAT WERE DONE. AND I

05:11:10.785 --> 05:11:12.020
KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT IT'S

05:11:12.086 --> 05:11:14.522
NOT THE ENTIRE MAPS. BUT I MEANT

05:11:14.589 --> 05:11:15.690
IT MORE TOWARDS THE TESTIMONY.

05:11:15.757 --> 05:11:16.991
IT WAS WRONG. IT WAS INCORRECT.

05:11:17.058 --> 05:11:18.893
WELL, THERE ARE FEWER FEWER

05:11:18.960 --> 05:11:21.162
SPLITS THAN THE TEXAS MAPS FOR

05:11:21.229 --> 05:11:23.164
SURE. THAT'S WHAT MY TESTIMONY

05:11:23.231 --> 05:11:26.434
WAS. OKAY, THE IF YOU DON'T MIND

05:11:26.501 --> 05:11:28.236
WHEN THERE WERE JUST SO YOU

05:11:28.302 --> 05:11:30.838
KNOW, WE DID HAVE THERE WERE

05:11:30.905 --> 05:11:32.373
SOME CHANGES. THEY DID TWO

05:11:32.440 --> 05:11:34.776
THINGS. THEY ELIMINATE A ZERO

05:11:34.842 --> 05:11:36.544
POPULATION SPLIT IN THE CITY OF

05:11:36.611 --> 05:11:38.713
INDUSTRY AND IMPROVE THE

05:11:38.780 --> 05:11:39.781
COMPACTNESS OF THE PLAN IN

05:11:39.847 --> 05:11:42.850
SOUTHERN SANTA ANA. WHEN DID

05:11:42.917 --> 05:11:46.621
THOSE CHANGES HAPPEN? YESTERDAY.

05:11:46.687 --> 05:11:50.191
YESTERDAY? WHEN? WHEN WERE THOSE

05:11:50.258 --> 05:11:52.360
CHANGES MADE PUBLIC TO ALL

05:11:52.427 --> 05:11:54.562
COMMITTEE MEMBERS? BECAUSE THEY

05:11:54.629 --> 05:11:56.397
WEREN'T MADE PUBLIC YESTERDAY AT

05:11:56.464 --> 05:11:58.499
8 A.M. FOR ME. BECAUSE WHEN I

05:11:58.566 --> 05:11:59.867
WROTE MINE, THE CITY OF CLOVIS

05:11:59.934 --> 05:12:01.436
HAD THREE CONGRESSIONAL

05:12:01.502 --> 05:12:02.303
DISTRICTS. THE CITY OF CLOVIS

05:12:02.370 --> 05:12:04.772
NOW HAS A CHANGE AND HAS ONE.

05:12:04.839 --> 05:12:06.107
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR

05:12:06.174 --> 05:12:07.475
COMMITTEE STAFF POSTED THEM ON

05:12:07.542 --> 05:12:09.277
OUR ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS WEBSITE

05:12:09.343 --> 05:12:11.479
YESTERDAY MORNING AT 8 A.M.

05:12:11.546 --> 05:12:13.281
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE THERE. AND

05:12:13.347 --> 05:12:15.883
WE'VE HAD OVER 3000, PROBABLY

05:12:15.950 --> 05:12:18.619
NOW, ABOUT 5000 RESIDENTS ACROSS

05:12:18.686 --> 05:12:19.987
CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE SUBMITTED

05:12:20.054 --> 05:12:21.823
TO THE ONLINE PORTAL THAT WAS

05:12:21.889 --> 05:12:24.092
AVAILABLE. THANK YOU, MADAM

05:12:24.158 --> 05:12:25.593
CHAIR. ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE, AS

05:12:25.660 --> 05:12:27.395
WELL AS CHAIR CERVANTES ON THE

05:12:27.462 --> 05:12:30.565
SENATE SIDE, A PORTAL THAT WAS

05:12:30.631 --> 05:12:32.033
AVAILABLE TO RESIDENTS AS OF

05:12:32.100 --> 05:12:34.168
FRIDAY, I THINK EVEN BEFORE

05:12:34.235 --> 05:12:35.536
THAT. AND SO WE WANT TO THANK

05:12:35.603 --> 05:12:37.672
YOU FOR BEING SO TRANSPARENT AND

05:12:37.738 --> 05:12:39.240
PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

05:12:39.307 --> 05:12:42.844
FOLKS TO SEE THE MAPS. AND AS

05:12:42.910 --> 05:12:44.579
HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY OUR

05:12:44.645 --> 05:12:46.013
WITNESSES TO, YOU KNOW, 70. I'M

05:12:46.080 --> 05:12:48.616
GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR HERE WITH

05:12:48.683 --> 05:12:50.852
THE DATA, 76.7% OF PEOPLE WILL

05:12:50.918 --> 05:12:52.620
BE IN THEIR SAME CONGRESSIONAL

05:12:52.687 --> 05:12:55.256
DISTRICT. THE MAPS CHANGE 58% OF

05:12:55.323 --> 05:12:58.960
DISTRICTS BY LESS THAN 20%, AND

05:12:59.026 --> 05:13:01.596
37% BY LESS THAN 10%. EIGHT

05:13:01.662 --> 05:13:02.930
DISTRICTS WILL BE IDENTICAL TO

05:13:02.997 --> 05:13:05.233
THE LINES DRAWN BY THE CITIZENS

05:13:05.299 --> 05:13:06.300
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. OKAY.

05:13:06.367 --> 05:13:08.803
THANK YOU. AS WE MOVE ON TO MY

05:13:08.870 --> 05:13:09.704
NEXT QUESTION, I'M NOT DONE

05:13:09.770 --> 05:13:11.572
HERE. I HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

05:13:11.639 --> 05:13:14.575
TIME SO I CAN MOVE ON. SO DO YOU

05:13:14.642 --> 05:13:15.209
AGREE? EXCUSE ME. WE'RE TALKING

05:13:15.276 --> 05:13:16.911
ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO FREEZE YOUR

05:13:16.978 --> 05:13:18.045
TIME, OKAY? AND ALLOW THE

05:13:18.112 --> 05:13:21.482
SENATOR TO FINISH WITH HER

05:13:21.549 --> 05:13:23.551
REPORT. HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE

05:13:23.618 --> 05:13:26.087
LEFT? 11 MINUTES AND 45 SECONDS.

05:13:26.154 --> 05:13:27.255
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM

05:13:27.321 --> 05:13:29.624
CHAIR. AND WE JUST. YOU KNOW, I

05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:30.892
WILL CERTAINLY KEEP DECORUM HERE

05:13:30.958 --> 05:13:32.727
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, BUT I WANT

05:13:32.793 --> 05:13:33.561
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC

05:13:33.628 --> 05:13:34.729
UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE'RE DOING

05:13:34.795 --> 05:13:36.130
HERE. AND THEN THERE'S 21

05:13:36.197 --> 05:13:37.165
DISTRICTS, EXACTLY THE IDEAL

05:13:37.231 --> 05:13:38.332
DISTRICT SIZE, THE SAME NUMBER

05:13:38.399 --> 05:13:40.468
AS THE CITIZEN REDISTRICTING

05:13:40.535 --> 05:13:41.402
COMMISSION AND THE PROPOSED

05:13:41.469 --> 05:13:42.470
CONGRESSIONAL MAPS, AS BEEN

05:13:42.537 --> 05:13:43.938
MENTIONED BY MR. BRENNAN, KEEPS

05:13:44.005 --> 05:13:46.307
MORE CITIES WHOLE THAN WITHIN A

05:13:46.374 --> 05:13:47.942
SINGLE DISTRICT THAN MOST RECENT

05:13:48.009 --> 05:13:49.944
MAPS ENACTED BY THE COMMISSION.

05:13:50.011 --> 05:13:53.014
AS YOU KNOW, THE COMMISSION HAD

05:13:53.080 --> 05:13:54.382
SIX REPUBLICANS, FIVE DEMOCRATS,

05:13:54.448 --> 05:13:56.617
FOUR NON PARTY PREFERENCE FOLKS

05:13:56.684 --> 05:13:58.719
THAT WERE DOING THE HARD WORK

05:13:58.786 --> 05:14:02.089
BACK IN 2020. AND SO I THINK

05:14:02.156 --> 05:14:04.225
THAT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, 76.7% OF

05:14:04.292 --> 05:14:05.693
THE CURRENT MAPS THAT YOU SEE

05:14:05.760 --> 05:14:06.994
HERE ARE BASED OFF THAT

05:14:07.061 --> 05:14:08.362
COMMISSION MAP IN 2020. SO

05:14:08.429 --> 05:14:11.365
THAT'S THESE ARE THESE ARE SMALL

05:14:11.432 --> 05:14:12.800
CHANGES WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT

05:14:12.867 --> 05:14:15.002
WE'RE COMBATING TEXAS ON THIS

05:14:15.069 --> 05:14:16.637
DEMOCRACY ISSUE, WHICH IS VERY

05:14:16.704 --> 05:14:17.939
IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. DO YOU

05:14:18.005 --> 05:14:19.640
AGREE THAT WE HAVE NOT ARE WE

05:14:19.707 --> 05:14:21.042
STARTING. OKAY. DO YOU AGREE

05:14:21.108 --> 05:14:23.411
THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD AS MANY

05:14:23.477 --> 05:14:25.780
HEARINGS AS WERE HELD BY THE

05:14:25.846 --> 05:14:26.847
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

05:14:26.914 --> 05:14:31.552
COMMISSION? DO YOU AGREE THAT WE

05:14:31.619 --> 05:14:33.154
HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH AS MANY

05:14:33.221 --> 05:14:34.655
HEARINGS? I THINK THE

05:14:34.722 --> 05:14:35.756
INFORMATION HAS BEEN THERE. THE

05:14:35.823 --> 05:14:37.291
MAPS ARE BASED ON PROCEEDINGS

05:14:37.358 --> 05:14:38.492
AND PUBLIC INPUT FROM

05:14:38.559 --> 05:14:39.727
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION PROCESS

05:14:39.794 --> 05:14:42.263
BASED ON THE 2020 CENSUS, VOTERS

05:14:42.330 --> 05:14:43.698
ARE ABLE TO SEE THOSE MAPS IN

05:14:43.764 --> 05:14:45.833
THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE

05:14:45.900 --> 05:14:47.168
WEBSITE, SUBMIT PUBLIC COMMENTS

05:14:47.235 --> 05:14:47.902
SO WE CAN ANSWER THEIR

05:14:47.969 --> 05:14:50.137
QUESTIONS. THE VOTERS WILL MAKE

05:14:50.204 --> 05:14:51.172
THE ULTIMATE DECISION ON THEIR

05:14:51.239 --> 05:14:52.740
MAPS. GOT IT. SO YOU AGREE. DO

05:14:52.807 --> 05:14:53.841
YOU AGREE THAT WE HAVE NOT

05:14:53.908 --> 05:14:55.710
FOLLOWED THE SAME REQUIREMENTS

05:14:55.776 --> 05:14:57.545
IN DRAWING LINES AS THE CITIZENS

05:14:57.612 --> 05:14:58.412
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WAS

05:14:58.479 --> 05:14:59.847
REQUIRED TO FOLLOW PURSUANT TO

05:14:59.914 --> 05:15:01.182
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION? AND

05:15:01.249 --> 05:15:03.718
WE'LL SAY AGAIN, OVER 76% OF

05:15:03.784 --> 05:15:05.319
THIS MAP THAT YOU SEE HERE HAD

05:15:05.386 --> 05:15:07.188
BEEN VETTED PUBLICLY, HAD BEEN

05:15:07.255 --> 05:15:09.624
DONE BY THE COMMISSION. AND FROM

05:15:09.690 --> 05:15:12.426
MR. WILLIS'S TESTIMONY IN SENATE

05:15:12.493 --> 05:15:13.227
ELECTIONS. AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO

05:15:13.294 --> 05:15:16.264
PONTIFICATE ON THIS, IS THE

05:15:16.330 --> 05:15:17.898
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SINCE

05:15:17.965 --> 05:15:21.135
FRIDAY OF LAST WEEK WILL HAVE 78

05:15:21.202 --> 05:15:24.338
DAYS. DID WE SAY 78 DAYS TO LOOK

05:15:24.405 --> 05:15:26.140
AT THIS BEFORE THEY IT HITS THE

05:15:26.207 --> 05:15:27.875
BALLOTS AND ON THE BALLOT THEY

05:15:27.942 --> 05:15:29.343
WILL HAVE A LINK THAT WILL

05:15:29.410 --> 05:15:31.312
DIRECT THEM TO THE MAP. SO THEY

05:15:31.379 --> 05:15:32.380
CAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE BE MORE

05:15:32.446 --> 05:15:33.581
EDUCATED WHEN THEY'RE AT THE

05:15:33.648 --> 05:15:34.849
BALLOT BOX AS WELL. AND

05:15:34.915 --> 05:15:36.217
CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE THE FINAL

05:15:36.284 --> 05:15:39.020
SAY. THIS IS MUCH MORE TIME THAN

05:15:39.086 --> 05:15:40.888
WOULD BE THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN

05:15:40.955 --> 05:15:42.290
GIVEN THROUGH THE REDISTRICTING

05:15:42.356 --> 05:15:44.492
PROCESS, WHICH WAS 14 DAYS. SO

05:15:44.558 --> 05:15:45.726
IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT,

05:15:45.793 --> 05:15:48.129
MR. WILLIS, I'D LOVE TO PUT YOU

05:15:48.195 --> 05:15:50.197
ON THE PHONE. OKAY, GOOD. I DID

05:15:50.264 --> 05:15:50.965
WELL FOR YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY.

05:15:51.032 --> 05:15:53.834
WAS ANY NON-GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE

05:15:53.901 --> 05:15:55.403
ASSISTING IN THE DRAWINGS OF

05:15:55.469 --> 05:15:59.140
THESE LINES? NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

05:15:59.206 --> 05:16:00.908
I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU WOULD INFER

05:16:00.975 --> 05:16:03.311
THAT. AGAIN, THIS IS A THIS IS

05:16:03.377 --> 05:16:05.846
AN ATTACK ON CALIFORNIANS. THIS

05:16:05.913 --> 05:16:07.815
IS AN ATTACK ON CALIFORNIANS.

05:16:07.882 --> 05:16:09.617
LET'S BE VERY CLEAR HERE WHAT IS

05:16:09.684 --> 05:16:10.751
HAPPENING. THERE ARE TEXAS

05:16:10.818 --> 05:16:11.719
LEGISLATORS THAT ARE BEING

05:16:11.786 --> 05:16:13.354
LOCKED UP AND REQUIRED TO BE

05:16:13.421 --> 05:16:14.722
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE

05:16:14.789 --> 05:16:16.023
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO DO THEIR

05:16:16.090 --> 05:16:17.625
JOB REPRESENTING THEIR

05:16:17.692 --> 05:16:19.727
COMMUNITIES. SO OUR RESPONSE IS

05:16:19.794 --> 05:16:21.095
ABSOLUTELY GOING TO SAY, WE

05:16:21.162 --> 05:16:23.331
WANT, AS CALIFORNIANS TO COMBAT

05:16:23.397 --> 05:16:26.000
THAT, HOW IN THE HELL ARE WE

05:16:26.067 --> 05:16:29.337
GOING TO SAY THAT MEDICARE

05:16:29.403 --> 05:16:30.571
CHILDREN THAT ARE ON MEDICARE,

05:16:30.638 --> 05:16:33.541
IT'S OKAY TO CONTINUE TO CUT 3.4

05:16:33.607 --> 05:16:34.942
MILLION CALIFORNIANS OFF OF

05:16:35.009 --> 05:16:36.677
MEDICARE. SO WOULD YOU BE OKAY

05:16:36.744 --> 05:16:37.712
WITH THAT, TELLING YOUR

05:16:37.778 --> 05:16:39.213
RESIDENTS IN THE DISTRICT THAT

05:16:39.280 --> 05:16:40.548
IT'S OKAY TO CUT THEM FROM

05:16:40.614 --> 05:16:43.217
MEDICARE? SO I'M ASKING THE

05:16:43.284 --> 05:16:45.820
QUESTIONS. AND ONE OF THE MAIN

05:16:45.886 --> 05:16:47.955
THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO KNOW ON

05:16:48.022 --> 05:16:49.623
THIS IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW

05:16:49.690 --> 05:16:51.459
WHO WROTE THE MAPS. THERE WAS A

05:16:51.525 --> 05:16:52.827
REPORT DONE BY KCRA THAT STATED

05:16:52.893 --> 05:16:54.729
THAT THE D TRIPLE C HAD A DIRECT

05:16:54.795 --> 05:16:55.863
INVOLVEMENT WITH THIS. IN THIS

05:16:55.930 --> 05:16:57.031
LEGISLATION, IT STATES THAT THE

05:16:57.098 --> 05:16:59.667
MAPS WERE CREATED PREPARED BY BY

05:16:59.734 --> 05:17:02.169
THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. THAT'S

05:17:02.236 --> 05:17:03.237
INACCURATE. THAT'S WHY IT'S

05:17:03.304 --> 05:17:04.705
PERTINENT TO THIS. BUT MOVING

05:17:04.772 --> 05:17:06.607
ON, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MEMBERS

05:17:06.674 --> 05:17:07.575
HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THESE

05:17:07.641 --> 05:17:10.544
MAPS PASSED? WE DO, IN THE SENSE

05:17:10.611 --> 05:17:11.645
THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT

05:17:11.712 --> 05:17:12.913
MEDICARE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

05:17:12.980 --> 05:17:14.982
THAT MEDICARE IS NOT CONTINUED

05:17:15.049 --> 05:17:15.883
TO BE CUT. WE WANT TO ENSURE

05:17:15.950 --> 05:17:18.085
THAT SNAP BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN.

05:17:18.152 --> 05:17:19.587
WHY ARE THEY BEING CUT? WHY CAN

05:17:19.653 --> 05:17:21.856
YOU GO BACK TO YOUR DISTRICT AND

05:17:21.922 --> 05:17:23.524
REALLY TELL THEM, WE'RE GOING TO

05:17:23.591 --> 05:17:24.825
CUT YOUR SNAP BENEFITS, WE'RE

05:17:24.892 --> 05:17:25.960
GOING TO CUT YOUR MEDICARE,

05:17:26.026 --> 05:17:27.528
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

05:17:27.595 --> 05:17:29.163
RACIALLY PROFILE YOU IN LOS

05:17:29.230 --> 05:17:30.731
ANGELES BECAUSE YOU'RE AN

05:17:30.798 --> 05:17:32.099
IMMIGRANT. AND ON TOP OF THAT,

05:17:32.166 --> 05:17:34.802
WE MIGHT JUST DECIDE IF WE LOSE

05:17:34.869 --> 05:17:36.737
THIS ELECTION, THAT TRUMP MIGHT

05:17:36.804 --> 05:17:39.006
BE ELECTED FOR A THIRD TERM,

05:17:39.073 --> 05:17:39.974
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE ELECTING

05:17:40.040 --> 05:17:42.209
KINGS, ALL OF A SUDDEN WE CANNOT

05:17:42.276 --> 05:17:44.779
WE CANNOT DO THAT. WE CANNOT AND

05:17:44.845 --> 05:17:46.213
WE WILL. OKAY. LET'S HAVE ORDER,

05:17:46.280 --> 05:17:47.615
PLEASE. HERE. IT'S LAUGHABLE.

05:17:47.681 --> 05:17:49.183
BUT THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT

05:17:49.250 --> 05:17:50.985
NOW. AND THIS IS TRUE. THIS IS

05:17:51.051 --> 05:17:52.019
TRUE. I APPRECIATE YOU TRULY

05:17:52.086 --> 05:17:53.421
BEING HONEST WITH THAT.

05:17:53.487 --> 05:17:55.022
ABSOLUTELY. I REALLY DO LIKE

05:17:55.089 --> 05:17:59.393
HONESTY. THAT WAS FAIRLY

05:17:59.460 --> 05:18:01.662
SURPRISING. UNDERSTANDING THE

05:18:01.729 --> 05:18:04.799
URGENCY DONE WITH WITH THIS AND

05:18:04.865 --> 05:18:05.966
HOW WE'RE MOVING IT THROUGH

05:18:06.033 --> 05:18:07.568
THAT. IT WAS OPENLY ADMITTED

05:18:07.635 --> 05:18:09.870
THAT WE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS

05:18:09.937 --> 05:18:11.005
LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AND THIS

05:18:11.071 --> 05:18:13.340
BODY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST.

05:18:13.407 --> 05:18:14.008
THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT WE

05:18:14.074 --> 05:18:15.643
NOT MISREPRESENT THE ANSWER WAS

05:18:15.709 --> 05:18:17.678
NOT WHAT WAS SAID, BUT THAT THIS

05:18:17.745 --> 05:18:20.314
GIVEN THIS, EVERY, EVERY, EVERY

05:18:20.381 --> 05:18:20.848
MEMBER OF CALIFORNIA HAS A

05:18:20.915 --> 05:18:22.583
VESTED INTEREST IN DEMOCRACY.

05:18:22.650 --> 05:18:23.818
OKAY, I REALIZE THAT WE LIKE TO

05:18:23.884 --> 05:18:25.786
PLAY GOTCHA GAMES TODAY, BUT

05:18:25.853 --> 05:18:27.154
LET'S KEEP IT IN CHECK. LET'S

05:18:27.221 --> 05:18:28.589
KEEP OUR QUESTIONS TO THE MERITS

05:18:28.656 --> 05:18:31.225
OF THIS BILL. AB 604, PLEASE.

05:18:31.292 --> 05:18:32.226
GIVEN THIS IS BEING RUSHED

05:18:32.293 --> 05:18:34.695
THROUGH WITH ZERO RESEARCH OR

05:18:34.762 --> 05:18:37.832
CONSIDERATION OF IMPLICATION, I

05:18:37.898 --> 05:18:40.534
FEEL IT'S KIND OF WORTHLESS TO

05:18:40.601 --> 05:18:41.969
ASK. BUT YOU KNOW, HAVE YOU READ

05:18:42.036 --> 05:18:44.805
THE STUDY BY JONES REGARDING

05:18:44.872 --> 05:18:46.507
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDERING AND

05:18:46.574 --> 05:18:49.910
TURNOUT? DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

05:18:49.977 --> 05:18:52.179
ABOUT AB 604, THE MERITS OF THE

05:18:52.246 --> 05:18:53.914
BILL? WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THE

05:18:53.981 --> 05:18:56.650
BILL? WELL, IT'S I DON'T SEE HOW

05:18:56.717 --> 05:18:58.052
THAT'S RELEVANT IN THE BILL. IT

05:18:58.118 --> 05:18:59.587
STATES THAT IT'S THE

05:18:59.653 --> 05:19:02.223
GERRYMANDERED MAP. AND I'M

05:19:02.289 --> 05:19:02.823
ASKING ABOUT RESEARCH DONE ON

05:19:02.890 --> 05:19:06.727
GERRYMANDERING. THE MAPS ARE

05:19:06.794 --> 05:19:09.730
PUBLICLY POSTED ON THE ASSEMBLY

05:19:09.797 --> 05:19:10.731
COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE FOR

05:19:10.798 --> 05:19:13.200
EVERYBODY TO SEE. THE VOTERS

05:19:13.267 --> 05:19:14.101
WILL BE THE ULTIMATE SAY ON

05:19:14.168 --> 05:19:15.369
WHETHER THESE DISTRICTS ARE

05:19:15.436 --> 05:19:17.304
APPROVED OR NOT FOR THE

05:19:17.371 --> 05:19:19.840
TEMPORARY BASIS UNTIL 2032, BUT

05:19:19.907 --> 05:19:23.043
I BELIEVE THAT GERRYMANDERING IS

05:19:23.110 --> 05:19:24.245
PERTINENT TO IT, AND THERE'S

05:19:24.311 --> 05:19:27.214
MULTIPLE STUDIES THAT HAVE TO

05:19:27.281 --> 05:19:28.048
DEAL WITH GERRYMANDERING THAT I

05:19:28.115 --> 05:19:31.018
THINK ARE VERY RELEVANT TO THE

05:19:31.085 --> 05:19:33.120
BILL. SINCE IT'S IN THE BILL, WE

05:19:33.187 --> 05:19:34.989
HAVE NOT READ IT. WHAT IS YOUR

05:19:35.055 --> 05:19:36.757
POINT? CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOUR

05:19:36.824 --> 05:19:37.992
QUESTION IS? THAT'D BE GREAT TO

05:19:38.058 --> 05:19:39.960
KNOW. WELL, IT'S THE FACT THAT

05:19:40.027 --> 05:19:40.895
GERRYMANDERING HAPPENING

05:19:40.961 --> 05:19:42.062
ANYWHERE ELSE OR EVERYWHERE ELSE

05:19:42.129 --> 05:19:43.597
WHEN WE HAVE EMPIRICAL DATA,

05:19:43.664 --> 05:19:45.165
THAT IT DOES NOT HELP THE PEOPLE

05:19:45.232 --> 05:19:47.635
OF CALIFORNIA. WHY WOULD WE

05:19:47.701 --> 05:19:51.005
BRING THAT HERE IF IT IF IT

05:19:51.071 --> 05:19:52.806
SHOWS US AND IT TELLS US THAT IN

05:19:52.873 --> 05:19:54.742
THESE STUDIES, YOU KNOW, THERE'S

05:19:54.808 --> 05:19:56.443
A STUDY DONE BY BMC STARKEY THAT

05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:57.611
ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT THE

05:19:57.678 --> 05:19:58.846
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

05:19:58.913 --> 05:20:01.148
GERRYMANDERING, REDISTRICTING

05:20:01.215 --> 05:20:02.883
AND INFANT MORTALITY AND DEATHS,

05:20:02.950 --> 05:20:05.185
THE VOTERS. AND IS AM I TAKING

05:20:05.252 --> 05:20:07.054
THIS TO BE A POSITION THAT YOU

05:20:07.121 --> 05:20:07.922
SUPPORT INDEPENDENT

05:20:07.988 --> 05:20:09.523
REDISTRICTING FOR THE ENTIRE 50

05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:11.292
STATES IN THE UNITED STATES?

05:20:11.358 --> 05:20:12.993
YES. OKAY. GOOD TO KNOW. YES, OF

05:20:13.060 --> 05:20:14.595
COURSE. THAT'S THAT'S GREAT TO

05:20:14.662 --> 05:20:15.796
HEAR. THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR.

05:20:15.863 --> 05:20:17.064
YEAH. ANYTHING YOU COULD DO TO

05:20:17.131 --> 05:20:19.733
HELP TEXAS AND FLORIDA LET THEM

05:20:19.800 --> 05:20:20.868
KNOW THAT THAT POSITION WOULD BE

05:20:20.935 --> 05:20:22.136
GREATLY APPRECIATED. THAT'S A

05:20:22.202 --> 05:20:23.837
GREAT POINT. THAT TIME AND TIME

05:20:23.904 --> 05:20:25.372
AGAIN I'VE GONE TO ADVOCATE, BUT

05:20:25.439 --> 05:20:27.441
I ALSO UNDERSTAND MY POSITION AS

05:20:27.508 --> 05:20:29.176
A LEGISLATOR IN THE STATE OF

05:20:29.243 --> 05:20:31.245
CALIFORNIA IS TO THE CALIFORNIA

05:20:31.312 --> 05:20:33.080
PEOPLE. AND WE CAN'T REACT TO

05:20:33.147 --> 05:20:34.715
WHAT OTHER STATES DO, WHAT

05:20:34.782 --> 05:20:35.916
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES. BECAUSE THE

05:20:35.983 --> 05:20:37.952
WAY I THINK ABOUT IT, SEVEN

05:20:38.018 --> 05:20:39.453
MONTHS AGO, THERE'S A DIFFERENT

05:20:39.520 --> 05:20:40.454
PERSON IN THE FEDERAL

05:20:40.521 --> 05:20:41.188
ADMINISTRATION AND IN THE WHITE

05:20:41.255 --> 05:20:43.724
HOUSE, COST OF LIVING WAS STILL

05:20:43.791 --> 05:20:45.826
$825,000. IN THE STATE, 25% OF

05:20:45.893 --> 05:20:47.428
RESIDENTS, 20% OF RESIDENTS

05:20:47.494 --> 05:20:48.729
STILL COULDN'T AFFORD IT. SO IF

05:20:48.796 --> 05:20:50.664
WE CREATED OUR POLICIES, WHICH

05:20:50.731 --> 05:20:52.600
IT FEELS LIKE HERE IN THIS

05:20:52.666 --> 05:20:54.134
LEGISLATIVE BODY IS REACTING TO

05:20:54.201 --> 05:20:55.502
EVERYBODY ELSE, WE'RE DOING A

05:20:55.569 --> 05:20:57.137
DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF

05:20:57.204 --> 05:20:58.072
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY IT'S

05:20:58.138 --> 05:21:00.140
IMPORTANT. SO YES, I AGREE WITH

05:21:00.207 --> 05:21:02.076
YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE HERE. I

05:21:02.142 --> 05:21:04.144
WISH WE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE

05:21:04.211 --> 05:21:05.946
MODEL TO THE REST OF THE NATION

05:21:06.013 --> 05:21:08.082
THAT THEY SHOULD ADOPT OURS, BUT

05:21:08.148 --> 05:21:09.984
INSTEAD, IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE

05:21:10.050 --> 05:21:10.951
FORGOTTEN THE STATEMENT THAT WAS

05:21:11.018 --> 05:21:12.853
MADE BY MICHELLE OBAMA THAT WHEN

05:21:12.920 --> 05:21:14.722
THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH. BUT

05:21:14.788 --> 05:21:16.357
INSTEAD NOW WE'VE THIS THE

05:21:16.423 --> 05:21:17.524
LEADERSHIP HERE IN THE STATE

05:21:17.591 --> 05:21:19.259
SAYS WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE'LL GO

05:21:19.326 --> 05:21:20.694
LOWER. WHEN THEY GO

05:21:20.761 --> 05:21:22.229
AUTHORITARIAN, WE'LL BE MORE

05:21:22.296 --> 05:21:22.863
AUTHORITARIAN. AND DID YOU HAVE

05:21:22.930 --> 05:21:25.466
MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MERITS

05:21:25.532 --> 05:21:26.767
OF THE BILL? YES. PLEASE GO

05:21:26.834 --> 05:21:27.868
AHEAD AND ASK THIS. YOU KNOW,

05:21:27.935 --> 05:21:30.104
THERE THERE'S JUST SO MANY

05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:31.705
EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT ARE ARE

05:21:31.772 --> 05:21:33.641
DONE ON THIS. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

05:21:33.707 --> 05:21:35.142
AT THE MAPS, HOW DID WE TAKE

05:21:35.209 --> 05:21:37.578
INTO CONSIDERATION COMMUNITIES

05:21:37.645 --> 05:21:39.713
OF INTEREST? YOU KNOW, WERE THEY

05:21:39.780 --> 05:21:42.349
DONE TO PROTECT RACE, RELIGION,

05:21:42.416 --> 05:21:44.118
ALL THE IDEOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE

05:21:44.184 --> 05:21:45.953
RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:21:46.020 --> 05:21:47.354
WE'RE PROTECTING THE VOTERS OF

05:21:47.421 --> 05:21:49.056
CALIFORNIA? WAS THAT DONE IN

05:21:49.123 --> 05:21:49.957
THAT CONSIDERATION? IT'S A

05:21:50.024 --> 05:21:51.158
PARTIZAN GERRYMANDER. THAT'S

05:21:51.225 --> 05:21:51.992
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

05:21:52.059 --> 05:21:53.594
THIS IS PARTIZAN. POLITICS IS

05:21:53.661 --> 05:21:55.496
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

05:21:55.562 --> 05:21:58.132
IF TEXAS WANTS TO AGAIN, IF

05:21:58.198 --> 05:22:00.000
TRUMP GIVES THEM A CALL AND

05:22:00.067 --> 05:22:01.802
SAYS, LITERALLY, AS HE DID WITH

05:22:01.869 --> 05:22:03.937
GOVERNOR ABBOTT, FIND ME FIVE

05:22:04.004 --> 05:22:05.773
SEATS, WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

05:22:05.839 --> 05:22:07.541
SIT BACK AND JUST SAY, WELL,

05:22:07.608 --> 05:22:08.876
IT'S OKAY. FIND THE FIVE SEATS.

05:22:08.942 --> 05:22:11.045
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 6 MILLION

05:22:11.111 --> 05:22:13.280
PEOPLE WILL BE TAKEN OFF OF

05:22:13.347 --> 05:22:13.914
MEDICARE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE

05:22:13.981 --> 05:22:15.716
NOT GOING TO STAND BY FOR THAT.

05:22:15.783 --> 05:22:17.618
SO NO, THIS IS COMPLETELY

05:22:17.685 --> 05:22:18.252
PARTIZAN POLITICS HERE.

05:22:18.318 --> 05:22:19.420
OBVIOUSLY THAT IS HAPPENING. AND

05:22:19.486 --> 05:22:21.488
WE'RE DOING SO WITH THE INTENT

05:22:21.555 --> 05:22:24.725
OF SUPPORTING AND BRINGING

05:22:24.792 --> 05:22:25.893
FORWARD THE QUALITY OF LIFE

05:22:25.959 --> 05:22:26.994
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN SO

05:22:27.061 --> 05:22:28.228
AFFECTED BY CALIFORNIANS,

05:22:28.295 --> 05:22:30.130
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR PARTY

05:22:30.197 --> 05:22:30.998
AFFILIATION, REGARDLESS OF WHERE

05:22:31.065 --> 05:22:33.834
YOU LIVE IN THE STATE. SO DO YOU

05:22:33.901 --> 05:22:35.836
KNOW IF THE MAPS WERE MADE SURE

05:22:35.903 --> 05:22:36.837
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

05:22:36.904 --> 05:22:38.238
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES,

05:22:38.305 --> 05:22:39.840
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST, BECAUSE

05:22:39.907 --> 05:22:41.108
IT'S STATED IN THE BILL, IT

05:22:41.175 --> 05:22:42.910
STATES THAT THESE MAPS WERE

05:22:42.976 --> 05:22:43.544
CREATED TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES

05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:45.312
OF INTEREST, AND IT DEFINES THAT

05:22:45.379 --> 05:22:47.381
TOO. YEAH, I I'LL JUST GO BACK

05:22:47.448 --> 05:22:48.916
TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID SEVERAL

05:22:48.982 --> 05:22:51.485
TIMES, WHICH IS THIS MAP. THE

05:22:51.552 --> 05:22:52.886
MAIN ARCHITECTURE OF THIS MAP IS

05:22:52.953 --> 05:22:54.021
FROM THE REDISTRICTING

05:22:54.088 --> 05:22:54.922
COMMISSION, AND THE

05:22:54.988 --> 05:22:56.790
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION ISSUED

05:22:56.857 --> 05:22:59.693
A VOLUMINOUS REPORT AND MAPS ALL

05:22:59.760 --> 05:23:01.562
ABOUT HOW THEY FOLLOWED THAT,

05:23:01.628 --> 05:23:02.763
HOW THEY FOLLOWED THE VOTING

05:23:02.830 --> 05:23:04.765
RIGHTS ACT, HOW THEY FOLLOWED

05:23:04.832 --> 05:23:05.599
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST, HOW

05:23:05.666 --> 05:23:06.834
THEY FOLLOWED GEOGRAPHIC

05:23:06.900 --> 05:23:07.634
INTEGRITY. JUST FOR CLARITY, FOR

05:23:07.701 --> 05:23:09.703
ME, YOU MEAN THE REDISTRICTING

05:23:09.770 --> 05:23:10.537
COMMISSION AND THE INDEPENDENT,

05:23:10.604 --> 05:23:12.439
AND YOU GUYS UTILIZE THOSE TO

05:23:12.506 --> 05:23:14.808
CREATE. OKAY, SO THAT WAS JUST

05:23:14.875 --> 05:23:16.343
FOR CLARITY ON MY PART, CORRECT?

05:23:16.410 --> 05:23:20.214
YES. AND BUT THAT AS MANY PEOPLE

05:23:20.280 --> 05:23:22.382
HAVE SAID ALREADY, THAT IS THE

05:23:22.449 --> 05:23:23.917
BASIS, THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS,

05:23:23.984 --> 05:23:26.353
THE BEGINNING PART FOR THIS MAP.

05:23:26.420 --> 05:23:27.888
AND AS PEOPLE HAVE SAID OVER AND

05:23:27.955 --> 05:23:31.358
OVER AGAIN, 76% OF THAT MAP IS

05:23:31.425 --> 05:23:33.160
BAKED INTO THIS MAP. BUT WHAT I

05:23:33.227 --> 05:23:34.495
HEARD FROM SOME OF THE TESTIMONY

05:23:34.561 --> 05:23:36.964
FROM SEIU TWO, THAT THE

05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:38.398
COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST WERE

05:23:38.465 --> 05:23:40.367
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT TO MAKE THIS

05:23:40.434 --> 05:23:42.136
MAP, AS THEY WERE BY THE

05:23:42.202 --> 05:23:43.737
COMMISSION. CORRECT. THEY

05:23:43.804 --> 05:23:45.239
FOLLOWED THE SAME CRITERIA. FAIR

05:23:45.305 --> 05:23:48.275
MAPS ACT, THE CRITERIA FOR THE

05:23:48.342 --> 05:23:49.276
COMMISSION, AND CONSISTENT WITH

05:23:49.343 --> 05:23:51.545
THE STATE CONSTITUTION. SO ALL

05:23:51.612 --> 05:23:53.881
OF THOSE YOU HAVE JUST OVER TWO

05:23:53.947 --> 05:23:56.483
MORE MINUTES. YEP. THANK YOU.

05:23:56.550 --> 05:23:57.918
NO, I APPRECIATE IT. I

05:23:57.985 --> 05:24:00.320
APPRECIATE THE CLARITY PROVIDED

05:24:00.387 --> 05:24:04.158
HERE. YOU KNOW, I, I REALLY DO

05:24:04.224 --> 05:24:05.926
WISH THAT I HAD MORE TIME, THAT

05:24:05.993 --> 05:24:07.394
EVERYBODY HAD MORE TIME. AS WE

05:24:07.461 --> 05:24:08.962
GET TO SEE THIS, AS IT'S

05:24:09.029 --> 05:24:13.567
CHANGING SO QUICKLY. SO THANK

05:24:13.634 --> 05:24:14.168
YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND THANK

05:24:14.234 --> 05:24:16.970
YOU FOR THE HONESTY. THANK YOU.

05:24:17.037 --> 05:24:19.740
WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO ASSEMBLY

05:24:19.807 --> 05:24:20.641
MEMBER SALEH. THANK YOU, MADAM

05:24:20.707 --> 05:24:21.742
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS, I

05:24:21.809 --> 05:24:23.744
DO APPRECIATE THE SECOND PART OF

05:24:23.811 --> 05:24:24.945
TODAY'S MEETING A LITTLE MORE

05:24:25.012 --> 05:24:27.381
WITH DECORUM, AND I DO ENCOURAGE

05:24:27.447 --> 05:24:27.981
ALL OF US TO REMEMBER THAT WE

05:24:28.048 --> 05:24:29.783
ARE AMBASSADORS OF CALIFORNIANS

05:24:29.850 --> 05:24:31.451
AND THAT OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS

05:24:31.518 --> 05:24:33.453
WANT TO SEE US BEHAVE WITH

05:24:33.520 --> 05:24:35.022
DECORUM. SO I WANT TO JUST THANK

05:24:35.088 --> 05:24:36.623
MY COLLEAGUES ALL THAT. THE

05:24:36.690 --> 05:24:37.758
SECOND PART HAS BEEN A LITTLE

05:24:37.825 --> 05:24:39.193
MORE WITH MORE CLASS AND MORE

05:24:39.259 --> 05:24:40.561
RESPECT TO EACH OTHER. THAT

05:24:40.627 --> 05:24:41.829
BEING SAID, THANK YOU TO BOTH

05:24:41.895 --> 05:24:43.096
MATURE LEADERS FOR TODAY'S

05:24:43.163 --> 05:24:44.565
PRESENTATION. I KNOW THIS IS

05:24:44.631 --> 05:24:45.365
INFORMATIONAL THAT CONTINUES

05:24:45.432 --> 05:24:48.135
PART OF THE PROCESS, AND I KNOW

05:24:48.202 --> 05:24:49.102
THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

05:24:49.169 --> 05:24:50.737
WAS ASKED MULTIPLE TIMES, IS

05:24:50.804 --> 05:24:51.805
THERE ANY VESTED INTEREST? I

05:24:51.872 --> 05:24:53.574
JUST WANT TO, FOR THE RECORD,

05:24:53.640 --> 05:24:55.008
POINT OUT THAT IN 2026, I HAVE

05:24:55.075 --> 05:24:55.876
ZERO INTEREST IN RUNNING FOR

05:24:55.943 --> 05:24:57.578
CONGRESS. WANT TO PUT THAT ON

05:24:57.644 --> 05:24:59.246
THE RECORD? I'M VERY HAPPY TO

05:24:59.313 --> 05:25:00.747
REPRESENT THE HALF A MILLION

05:25:00.814 --> 05:25:02.149
PEOPLE IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT.

05:25:02.216 --> 05:25:03.317
I'M VERY PROUD TO REPRESENT, AND

05:25:03.383 --> 05:25:05.853
SO I WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH

05:25:05.919 --> 05:25:06.787
FOR THEM. THAT BEING SAID, ALSO,

05:25:06.854 --> 05:25:08.121
I ACTUALLY WANT TO APPRECIATE

05:25:08.188 --> 05:25:10.023
SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE TODAY

05:25:10.090 --> 05:25:11.859
BY THE PUBLIC, SPECIFICALLY

05:25:11.925 --> 05:25:13.293
THOSE THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION.

05:25:13.360 --> 05:25:15.095
WHY? BECAUSE THEY WERE RAISING

05:25:15.162 --> 05:25:17.965
THE ALARM OF REPRESENTATION. AND

05:25:18.031 --> 05:25:19.733
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I

05:25:19.800 --> 05:25:22.236
AGREE WITH YOU. WHEN I REPRESENT

05:25:22.302 --> 05:25:24.071
A DISTRICT THAT'S HIGHLY

05:25:24.137 --> 05:25:26.540
IMMIGRANT, HIGHLY UNDOCUMENTED,

05:25:26.607 --> 05:25:29.176
AND THEY WANT A VOICE, A VOICE

05:25:29.243 --> 05:25:31.645
OF THEIR FAMILIES BEING TAKEN,

05:25:31.712 --> 05:25:34.615
THEIR FAMILIES BEING KIDNAPED BY

05:25:34.681 --> 05:25:37.751
THIS ADMINISTRATION. AND I WILL

05:25:37.818 --> 05:25:41.021
TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THAT MAYBE I

05:25:41.088 --> 05:25:43.123
CAN'T SAY 100%, BUT A GOOD

05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:45.058
AMOUNT OF EXAMPLES, BUT THERE'S

05:25:45.125 --> 05:25:47.094
NO WARRANTS, THERE'S NO

05:25:47.160 --> 05:25:48.862
DOCUMENTATION AND SHOWING UP TO

05:25:48.929 --> 05:25:49.830
SNAP PEOPLE AROUND, TAKE THEM,

05:25:49.897 --> 05:25:53.000
JUST TAKE THEM TO MY DISTRICT,

05:25:53.066 --> 05:25:55.035
WHO I PROUDLY REPRESENT WILL NOT

05:25:55.102 --> 05:25:57.537
STAND FOR THAT. AND WHAT I'M

05:25:57.604 --> 05:25:59.673
VERY HAPPY, INCLUDING IN THE

05:25:59.740 --> 05:26:02.643
PANEL EARLIER THAT SPOKE IN

05:26:02.709 --> 05:26:04.778
OPPOSITION, VERY CREDIBLE

05:26:04.845 --> 05:26:06.146
INDIVIDUALS THAT SPOKE ABOUT THE

05:26:06.213 --> 05:26:07.648
PROCESS OF AN INDEPENDENT

05:26:07.714 --> 05:26:09.917
COMMISSION AND HOW THEY WERE

05:26:09.983 --> 05:26:10.550
PART OF THE PROCESS. AND YEAH,

05:26:10.617 --> 05:26:11.885
THEY SHARED THEIR, THEIR, THEIR

05:26:11.952 --> 05:26:14.087
NØ SIDE, BUT THEY SPOKE ABOUT

05:26:14.154 --> 05:26:17.090
THE PROCESS, THE PUBLIC COMMENT,

05:26:17.157 --> 05:26:19.026
WHAT IT TOOK TO GET TO THIS

05:26:19.092 --> 05:26:20.327
POINT. AND AS I SAY, AS

05:26:20.394 --> 05:26:21.995
CALIFORNIA GOES, THE NATION

05:26:22.062 --> 05:26:23.797
GOES. SO NOW THAT WE'RE TALKING

05:26:23.864 --> 05:26:25.365
ABOUT HOW THIS PROCESS WAS GREAT

05:26:25.432 --> 05:26:26.700
AND MEANINGFUL, I CAN TELL YOU

05:26:26.767 --> 05:26:28.435
AS A FORMER COUNCILMEMBER IN MY

05:26:28.502 --> 05:26:30.170
DISTRICT, WE WERE PART OF THAT

05:26:30.237 --> 05:26:32.506
PROCESS IN PUBLIC HEARINGS AND

05:26:32.572 --> 05:26:33.640
RAISING OUR HAND AND SAYING THAT

05:26:33.707 --> 05:26:35.943
THIS CITY SHOULD BE PART OF THAT

05:26:36.009 --> 05:26:36.944
CITY, THAT THIS CITY, THAT IT

05:26:37.010 --> 05:26:39.079
JUST IT WAS A PROCESS THAT AT

05:26:39.146 --> 05:26:40.247
LEAST AS A LOCAL COUNCILMEMBER,

05:26:40.314 --> 05:26:41.682
I WAS PART OF, AND I CAN TELL

05:26:41.748 --> 05:26:44.952
YOU THAT IT FELT GOOD TO BE PART

05:26:45.018 --> 05:26:46.420
OF A PROCESS OF WHAT OUR

05:26:46.486 --> 05:26:47.054
DISTRICTS LOOK LIKE, NOT ONLY

05:26:47.120 --> 05:26:47.821
FOR CONGRESSIONAL, FOR STATE

05:26:47.888 --> 05:26:49.923
SENATE AND FOR STATE ASSEMBLY.

05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.857
I'M HAPPY BECAUSE I WILL BE

05:26:50.924 --> 05:26:52.326
HONEST WITH YOU, I HAD SOME

05:26:52.392 --> 05:26:54.027
CONCERNS OF THIS MOVING FORWARD

05:26:54.094 --> 05:26:55.929
WITH THIS. BUT WHEN I READ IN

05:26:55.996 --> 05:26:58.098
THE BILL, BECAUSE I READ IT TO

05:26:58.165 --> 05:27:01.001
THAT, IT WOULD BE TEMPORARY AND

05:27:01.068 --> 05:27:03.003
THAT IT WOULD RETURN BACK TO THE

05:27:03.070 --> 05:27:04.171
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. I WAS

05:27:04.237 --> 05:27:06.807
VERY PROUD. AND I THINK

05:27:06.873 --> 05:27:08.041
INDEPENDENTS OUT THERE IN

05:27:08.108 --> 05:27:09.476
CALIFORNIA NOT LOOKING AT EITHER

05:27:09.543 --> 05:27:10.944
EITHER REPRESENTATION OF A

05:27:11.011 --> 05:27:13.880
PARTY. I THINK THAT'S VERY

05:27:13.947 --> 05:27:15.482
MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THIS IS A

05:27:15.549 --> 05:27:18.885
VERY DIRECT TO MY PRO TEM, MY

05:27:18.952 --> 05:27:22.489
MAJORITY LEADER COMMENTS. SHE

05:27:22.556 --> 05:27:26.159
SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A

05:27:26.226 --> 05:27:27.594
TEMPORARY APPROACH THAT ONCE WE

05:27:27.661 --> 05:27:29.396
GET BACK TO THE REGULAR

05:27:29.463 --> 05:27:31.465
SCHEDULE, THE CALIFORNIANS WILL

05:27:31.531 --> 05:27:32.966
HAVE A COMMISSION THAT THEY

05:27:33.033 --> 05:27:34.768
SUPPORT. AND THEY LIKE

05:27:34.835 --> 05:27:36.536
INDEPENDENTS, REPUBLICANS AND

05:27:36.603 --> 05:27:37.704
DEMOCRATS. SO THAT BEING SAID,

05:27:37.771 --> 05:27:40.140
THIS IS A TEMPORARY APPROACH,

05:27:40.207 --> 05:27:42.642
AND I RESPECT THE OPPOSITION'S

05:27:42.709 --> 05:27:44.578
COMMENTS. BUT I ALSO HAVE TO

05:27:44.644 --> 05:27:47.814
REPRESENT MY DISTRICT AS AS

05:27:47.881 --> 05:27:48.982
SENATOR CERVANTES EARLIER SAID,

05:27:49.049 --> 05:27:50.884
WHEN SHE GOES TO THE DISTRICT,

05:27:50.951 --> 05:27:52.052
WE WERE OUT IN THE DISTRICT FOR

05:27:52.119 --> 05:27:53.453
30 DAYS AND I HEARD FROM

05:27:53.520 --> 05:27:54.755
COMMUNITY, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

05:27:54.821 --> 05:27:56.823
PROTECT ME? HOW ARE YOU AS BEING

05:27:56.890 --> 05:27:58.859
A STATE REP? YOU WERE A LOCAL

05:27:58.925 --> 05:27:59.860
MAYOR. NOW YOU'RE A STATE. WE

05:27:59.926 --> 05:28:02.029
HAVE NOW HAVE QUOTE UNQUOTE, I

05:28:02.095 --> 05:28:03.463
QUOTE THE PRESIDENT MORE POWER

05:28:03.530 --> 05:28:04.698
NOW. AND THEY SEE IT AS MORE

05:28:04.765 --> 05:28:06.066
AUTHORITY, MORE POWER. I SEE IT

05:28:06.133 --> 05:28:08.035
AS MORE OF A VOICE. AND I'M

05:28:08.101 --> 05:28:09.636
BRINGING THAT VOICE TO MY

05:28:09.703 --> 05:28:10.303
CONSTITUENTS AND SAY, YES, THIS

05:28:10.370 --> 05:28:11.938
IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO REACT. AND

05:28:12.005 --> 05:28:14.107
THE BIGGEST PART OF THIS PROCESS

05:28:14.174 --> 05:28:15.876
THAT UNLIKE TEXAS, WHERE THEY'RE

05:28:15.942 --> 05:28:18.011
GOING TO LEGISLATE AND DO THIS

05:28:18.078 --> 05:28:19.846
AND RAM IT DOWN PEOPLE'S

05:28:19.913 --> 05:28:21.248
THROATS, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE

05:28:21.314 --> 05:28:23.016
VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA A VOICE

05:28:23.083 --> 05:28:25.719
SAY, YOU DECIDE. AND TO EVERYONE

05:28:25.786 --> 05:28:27.687
TALKING ABOUT A PROCESS OF HOW

05:28:27.754 --> 05:28:28.989
WE GOT HERE, FULLY UNDERSTAND

05:28:29.056 --> 05:28:30.157
AND FULLY RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES

05:28:30.223 --> 05:28:32.092
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOW WE GOT

05:28:32.159 --> 05:28:33.527
HERE. FULLY RESPECT THAT. BUT I

05:28:33.593 --> 05:28:34.728
CAN ASSURE YOU THAT ONE OF THE

05:28:34.795 --> 05:28:36.863
QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED IN THIS

05:28:36.930 --> 05:28:38.732
PROCESS IS, HOW WERE THESE MAPS

05:28:38.799 --> 05:28:40.033
PUT TOGETHER? AND I THINK WITHIN

05:28:40.100 --> 05:28:41.034
TIME OF US MOVING FORWARD, WE

05:28:41.101 --> 05:28:43.537
WILL SEE THAT THE PROCESS OF THE

05:28:43.603 --> 05:28:45.238
COMMISSION WAS WAS MIRRORED IN

05:28:45.305 --> 05:28:47.707
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES,

05:28:47.774 --> 05:28:51.211
PROTECTING IS IT 100% TO THE TO

05:28:51.278 --> 05:28:53.246
THE MAJORITY LEADER'S COMMENT.

05:28:53.313 --> 05:28:54.581
IT'S A PROCESS TO PROTECT

05:28:54.648 --> 05:28:56.450
COMMUNITY. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

05:28:56.516 --> 05:28:57.617
100% FAVORABLE FOR EVERYONE, BUT

05:28:57.684 --> 05:28:58.919
IT'S TEMPORARY. IT'S GOING TO BE

05:28:58.985 --> 05:29:01.621
THREE CYCLES 26, 28 AND 30 BACK

05:29:01.688 --> 05:29:03.924
IN 32. WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO

05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:06.426
THE COMMISSION AND I WILL

05:29:06.493 --> 05:29:07.260
HAPPILY MISS TALKING WITH YOU.

05:29:07.327 --> 05:29:09.529
AND I WILL COAUTHOR A RESOLUTION

05:29:09.596 --> 05:29:11.531
SAYING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE ALL

05:29:11.598 --> 05:29:12.766
50 STATES DO THIS. I WILL

05:29:12.833 --> 05:29:14.568
COAUTHOR WITH REPUBLICAN AS A

05:29:14.634 --> 05:29:17.804
DEMOCRAT SAYING ALL STATES

05:29:17.871 --> 05:29:19.506
SHOULD DO THIS MOVING FORWARD.

05:29:19.573 --> 05:29:21.074
HAPPILY. WE DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S

05:29:21.141 --> 05:29:23.577
THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND ONCE

05:29:23.643 --> 05:29:24.845
THE VOTERS DECIDE THAT THIS

05:29:24.911 --> 05:29:27.481
MIGHT BE A TEMPORARY APPROACH TO

05:29:27.547 --> 05:29:30.050
PROTECT DEMOCRACY, AND WE WILL

05:29:30.117 --> 05:29:31.785
HAPPILY DO THAT TODAY, AT LEAST,

05:29:31.852 --> 05:29:34.221
MY VOTE IS FOR MY CONSTITUENTS

05:29:34.287 --> 05:29:36.490
THAT WE GO BACK IN 2032 AND THE

05:29:36.556 --> 05:29:38.291
VOTERS GO BACK TO THIS

05:29:38.358 --> 05:29:39.292
COMMISSION, THAT THEY FULLY

05:29:39.359 --> 05:29:40.727
SUPPORT INDEPENDENTS,

05:29:40.794 --> 05:29:42.229
REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS. BASED ON

05:29:42.295 --> 05:29:45.398
TODAY'S PUBLIC COMMENT. BUT SNAP

05:29:45.465 --> 05:29:47.267
PROGRAMS, MEDI-CAL, MEDICAID ARE

05:29:47.334 --> 05:29:50.437
ON THE LINE, AND I WILL NOT

05:29:50.504 --> 05:29:51.905
STAND FOR ANY ONE MORE COMMUNITY

05:29:51.972 --> 05:29:53.039
MEMBERS TO BE TAKEN AND SNATCHED

05:29:53.106 --> 05:29:56.243
MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE ONE PART OF

05:29:56.309 --> 05:29:57.711
OUR NATION, ONE PART OF OUR

05:29:57.777 --> 05:29:59.880
STATE, ONE PART OF OUR CITY IS

05:29:59.946 --> 05:30:04.184
BEING TARGETED. SO I WELCOME THE

05:30:04.251 --> 05:30:05.952
SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY. LET'S MAKE

05:30:06.019 --> 05:30:09.456
THIS A TEMPORARY APPROACH. AND

05:30:09.523 --> 05:30:12.058
LAST THING I'LL SAY IS, IF TEXAS

05:30:12.125 --> 05:30:13.860
AND ANY OTHER STATES BACKS DOWN.

05:30:13.927 --> 05:30:16.196
SO CALIFORNIA, IT'S VERY CLEAR

05:30:16.263 --> 05:30:18.899
IN THE LANGUAGE THAT IF NO ONE

05:30:18.965 --> 05:30:19.533
ELSE DOES ANYTHING, CALIFORNIA

05:30:19.599 --> 05:30:21.401
WILL REMAIN. AND WE WILL

05:30:21.468 --> 05:30:22.502
CONTINUE RESPECTING THE LINES

05:30:22.569 --> 05:30:25.038
THAT THE COMMISSION PUT

05:30:25.105 --> 05:30:27.507
TOGETHER. SO WITH THAT, I LOOK

05:30:27.574 --> 05:30:30.877
FORWARD TO CALIFORNIANS, OUR 20

05:30:30.944 --> 05:30:31.878
MILLION VOTERS. IS THAT WHAT WE

05:30:31.945 --> 05:30:33.780
SAID? 20 PLUS, 20 PLUS MILLION

05:30:33.847 --> 05:30:35.015
VOTERS WILL HAVE US AT THE

05:30:35.081 --> 05:30:36.917
BALLOT BOX ON NOVEMBER 4TH. AND

05:30:36.983 --> 05:30:38.418
RESPECTING EVERYONE'S OPINION,

05:30:38.485 --> 05:30:40.520
THEY WILL DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS

05:30:40.587 --> 05:30:42.055
NEXT. AND THE LAST, LAST PART OF

05:30:42.122 --> 05:30:44.090
THAT PROCESS, THEY WILL HAVE 78

05:30:44.157 --> 05:30:47.027
DAYS TO LOOK AT THE MAPS. IT'S

05:30:47.093 --> 05:30:48.595
PUBLIC NOW. I HAVE THE LINK. IF

IN ORDER TO WORK ON REDRAWING

05:36:57.063 --> 05:36:57.997
OPTION TO WEIGH IN, WHICH THEY

05:36:58.064 --> 05:37:00.633
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO OVER, I

05:37:00.700 --> 05:37:02.702
THINK, 4000 OR 5000 PEOPLE. YOU

05:37:02.769 --> 05:37:03.236
KNOW MORE THAN I DO, MADAM

05:37:03.303 --> 05:37:05.672
CHAIR, ON ON THIS GOOD WORK THAT

05:37:05.738 --> 05:37:06.873
YOU'VE DONE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

05:37:06.940 --> 05:37:08.975
THE MAPS VERY PUBLIC. SO THE

05:37:09.042 --> 05:37:10.343
MAPS ARE BASED ON KNOWLEDGE AND

05:37:10.410 --> 05:37:10.977
PUBLIC INPUT FROM THE

05:37:11.044 --> 05:37:11.611
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. SO WE

05:37:11.678 --> 05:37:14.147
AGREE WITH THAT. AND THE

05:37:14.213 --> 05:37:16.416
PROPOSED MAP SPLITS FEWER CITIES

05:37:16.482 --> 05:37:18.251
THAN THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION

05:37:18.318 --> 05:37:20.119
MAP. WE AGREE WITH THAT. THE MAP

05:37:20.186 --> 05:37:20.853
REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SPLIT

05:37:20.920 --> 05:37:23.289
CITIES FROM 60 TO 57. THIS MAP

05:37:23.356 --> 05:37:25.858
MAKES 26 CITIES WHOLE THAT HAVE

05:37:25.925 --> 05:37:27.260
BEEN SPLIT UP UNDER THE CURRENT

05:37:27.327 --> 05:37:28.828
LINES. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU

05:37:28.895 --> 05:37:30.997
A LITTLE BIT EXAMPLE, BECAUSE I

05:37:31.064 --> 05:37:31.631
DID OVERHEAR YOUR CONVERSATION

05:37:31.698 --> 05:37:33.733
BEFORE ASSEMBLY MEMBER, BECAUSE

05:37:33.800 --> 05:37:35.468
YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

05:37:35.535 --> 05:37:37.770
CITY OF CLOVIS. IS THAT TRUE?

05:37:37.837 --> 05:37:39.706
YES. OKAY. YES. THE ORIGINAL MAP

05:37:39.772 --> 05:37:40.974
THAT I'D SEEN, CLOVIS WAS SPLIT

05:37:41.040 --> 05:37:43.076
INTO THREE, BUT THE MAP

05:37:43.142 --> 05:37:45.511
YESTERDAY PUT IT IN ONE, SO IT'S

05:37:45.578 --> 05:37:46.713
GREAT. I'M GLAD YOU WERE LOOKING

05:37:46.779 --> 05:37:48.414
AT THE MAPS TO UNDERSTAND THE

05:37:48.481 --> 05:37:49.816
IMPACTS ON YOUR COMMUNITIES.

05:37:49.882 --> 05:37:52.585
BECAUSE OF THIS LEGISLATION,

05:37:52.652 --> 05:37:53.286
EVERY CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO

05:37:53.353 --> 05:37:56.956
DO THAT. SO SPECIFIC TO THE CITY

05:37:57.023 --> 05:37:58.591
OF FRESNO, THE CITY HAS WAS

05:37:58.658 --> 05:37:59.626
ALREADY SPLIT BY THE

05:37:59.692 --> 05:38:01.227
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION INTO

05:38:01.294 --> 05:38:03.262
THREE DISTRICTS SPECIFIC TO THE

05:38:03.329 --> 05:38:05.431
CITY OF CLOVIS. IT WAS

05:38:05.498 --> 05:38:07.000
PREVIOUSLY WHOLE AND IS SPLIT BY

05:38:07.066 --> 05:38:09.302
THIS PLAN. HOWEVER, THERE ARE 26

05:38:09.369 --> 05:38:10.870
CITIES THAT WERE SPLIT BY THE

05:38:10.937 --> 05:38:12.305
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION THAT

05:38:12.372 --> 05:38:14.674
THIS PLAN MAKES WHOLE. SO AS A

05:38:14.741 --> 05:38:15.575
RESULT, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

05:38:15.642 --> 05:38:19.779
CITIES SPLIT IS REDUCED FROM 60

05:38:19.846 --> 05:38:21.648
TO 57, AND TWO OF THOSE INVOLVED

05:38:21.714 --> 05:38:24.250
ZERO PEOPLE. THAT WAS GOING TO

05:38:24.317 --> 05:38:25.985
GO BACK TO VICE CHAIR MACEDO.

05:38:26.052 --> 05:38:28.287
SHE WAS SHE SHE HAD THE FLOOR

05:38:28.354 --> 05:38:29.489
HERE. LET HER CONTINUE WITH HER

05:38:29.555 --> 05:38:32.125
QUESTIONING. PLEASE. I'M NOT

05:38:32.191 --> 05:38:33.192
EXPECTING AN ANSWER TO THIS, BUT

05:38:33.259 --> 05:38:34.694
I'LL ASK IT ANYWAY. DID ANYONE

05:38:34.761 --> 05:38:36.863
WITH A CONFLICT OF INTEREST,

05:38:36.929 --> 05:38:38.564
INCLUDING POTENTIAL CANDIDATES

05:38:38.631 --> 05:38:39.899
FOR CONGRESS? MR. SALAS, I KNOW

05:38:39.966 --> 05:38:41.668
THIS TAKES YOU OUT OF IT, BUT

05:38:41.734 --> 05:38:43.469
DON'T WORRY. PARTICIPATE IN

05:38:43.536 --> 05:38:44.604
DRAWING OR REVIEWING THE MAPS.

05:38:44.671 --> 05:38:45.972
ANY POTENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR

05:38:46.039 --> 05:38:47.774
CONGRESS? NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

05:38:47.840 --> 05:38:49.609
OKAY, IF THESE MAPS ARE

05:38:49.676 --> 05:38:51.177
CHALLENGED IN COURT, HOW LONG

05:38:51.244 --> 05:38:53.246
COULD CALIFORNIANS BE LEFT

05:38:53.312 --> 05:38:54.881
UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHO REPRESENTS

05:38:54.947 --> 05:38:56.115
THEM, IN WHICH DISTRICTS THEY

05:38:56.182 --> 05:38:59.052
RESIDE? THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE A

05:38:59.118 --> 05:39:01.754
QUESTION FOR THE ATTORNEYS. CAN

05:39:01.821 --> 05:39:03.523
YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION? IF

05:39:03.589 --> 05:39:04.724
THESE MAPS ARE CHALLENGED IN

05:39:04.791 --> 05:39:06.592
COURT, WHICH I'M ASSUMING THEY

05:39:06.659 --> 05:39:08.628
LIKELY WILL BE, HOW LONG COULD

05:39:08.695 --> 05:39:10.129
CALIFORNIANS BE LEFT UNCERTAIN

05:39:10.196 --> 05:39:11.931
ABOUT WHO REPRESENTS THEM, IN

05:39:11.998 --> 05:39:14.701
WHICH DISTRICTS THEY RESIDE? I

05:39:14.767 --> 05:39:16.102
THINK THERE'LL ALWAYS BE

05:39:16.169 --> 05:39:17.336
CERTAIN. I MEAN, THEY WILL

05:39:17.403 --> 05:39:18.805
ALWAYS BE CERTAIN ON WHO

05:39:18.871 --> 05:39:21.240
REPRESENTS THEM AND WHAT MAPS

05:39:21.307 --> 05:39:23.209
APPLY TO EACH ELECTION. SO YOU

05:39:23.276 --> 05:39:24.477
DON'T SEE ANY CHALLENGES IN

05:39:24.544 --> 05:39:25.712
COURT DELAYING THIS? I THINK

05:39:25.778 --> 05:39:28.114
THAT THESE MAPS ARE LEGALLY

05:39:28.181 --> 05:39:31.250
SOUND ABSOLUTELY INTERESTING.

05:39:31.317 --> 05:39:33.820
OKAY, WHOEVER IS PAYING YOU, I'M

05:39:33.886 --> 05:39:36.155
SURE WILL MAYBE AGREE WITH YOU.

05:39:36.222 --> 05:39:37.557
HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE JUSTIFY

05:39:37.623 --> 05:39:38.725
ABANDONING THE TRANSPARENT,

05:39:38.791 --> 05:39:40.026
VOTER APPROVED COMMISSION

05:39:40.093 --> 05:39:42.128
PROCESS IN FAVOR OF A SECRETIVE

05:39:42.195 --> 05:39:43.763
PROCESS CONTROLLED BY, LIKE YOU

05:39:43.830 --> 05:39:45.131
JUST SAID, PARTIZAN INTERESTS?

05:39:45.198 --> 05:39:46.699
BECAUSE THIS IS A PARTIZAN

05:39:46.766 --> 05:39:48.034
GERRYMANDER? YEAH, TEXAS STARTED

05:39:48.101 --> 05:39:50.336
IT. I MEAN, IF TEXAS IF WHEN

05:39:50.403 --> 05:39:52.572
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS THE

05:39:52.638 --> 05:39:55.475
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS TO FIND HIM

05:39:55.541 --> 05:39:56.976
FIVE SEATS, LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT

05:39:57.043 --> 05:39:58.544
HAPPENED, JUST LIKE HE DID IN

05:39:58.611 --> 05:40:00.446
GEORGIA DURING THE 20 THE LAST

05:40:00.513 --> 05:40:02.048
ELECTION. SO YOU WANT TO TALK

05:40:02.115 --> 05:40:04.150
ABOUT CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND

05:40:04.217 --> 05:40:06.385
CORRUPTION. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

05:40:06.452 --> 05:40:07.787
LET'S ABSOLUTELY TALK ABOUT IT,

05:40:07.854 --> 05:40:09.222
BECAUSE I THINK THE PUBLIC

05:40:09.288 --> 05:40:10.523
SHOULD KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS

05:40:10.590 --> 05:40:12.091
GOING ON HERE. SO WHAT WE'RE

05:40:12.158 --> 05:40:14.093
DOING IN THE VERY LEGAL WAY AND

05:40:14.160 --> 05:40:16.062
TRANSPARENT WAY IS PROVIDING A

05:40:16.129 --> 05:40:19.031
REACTION TO THE TEXAS PHONE CALL

05:40:19.098 --> 05:40:21.067
THAT THAT TRUMP DECIDED TO DO,

05:40:21.134 --> 05:40:22.902
TO ASK FOR FIVE SEATS, TO

05:40:22.969 --> 05:40:24.637
BASICALLY CIRCUMVENT OUR

05:40:24.704 --> 05:40:26.539
DEMOCRACY, TO SUPERSEDE AND TO

05:40:26.606 --> 05:40:28.207
TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FROM

05:40:28.274 --> 05:40:29.742
PEOPLE. THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE

05:40:29.809 --> 05:40:31.477
HAVE A BUNCH OF WORKING

05:40:31.544 --> 05:40:32.578
FAMILIES, ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

05:40:32.645 --> 05:40:34.080
HERE TODAY, BECAUSE THEY ARE

05:40:34.147 --> 05:40:35.782
THEY'RE TIRED OF IT. RURAL

05:40:35.848 --> 05:40:37.583
HOSPITALS ARE GOING TO BE

05:40:37.650 --> 05:40:39.152
COMPLETELY DECIMATED. I MEAN,

05:40:39.218 --> 05:40:40.787
ALL OF IT, YOU KNOW, THIS AND

05:40:40.853 --> 05:40:42.789
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY TOUGH.

05:40:42.855 --> 05:40:44.891
SO AND I WOULD ACTUALLY JUST

05:40:44.957 --> 05:40:45.725
SAY, TOO, IF I'M DOWN WITH YOU,

05:40:45.792 --> 05:40:48.227
I THINK IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A

05:40:48.294 --> 05:40:48.861
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AT THE

05:40:48.928 --> 05:40:50.563
FEDERAL LEVEL, YOU ALL HAVE THE

05:40:50.630 --> 05:40:51.831
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. YOU CAN

05:40:51.898 --> 05:40:54.901
GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND ASK

05:40:54.967 --> 05:40:56.335
FOR IT NOW TO CREATE A 50 STATE

05:40:56.402 --> 05:40:58.104
NATIONWIDE INDEPENDENT

05:40:58.171 --> 05:41:00.306
REDISTRICTING PLAN. THAT WOULD

05:41:00.373 --> 05:41:02.108
BE FANTASTIC. I DO IT ALL. THANK

05:41:02.175 --> 05:41:05.678
YOU. ABSOLUTELY. IF YOU KEEP YOU

05:41:05.745 --> 05:41:08.281
GUYS, KEEP BRINGING UP TEXAS.

05:41:08.347 --> 05:41:11.117
WHY IS OTHER MISSOURI. WELL,

05:41:11.184 --> 05:41:12.852
WELL NOW YOU BRING IT UP

05:41:12.919 --> 05:41:14.620
MAJORITY LEADER. BUT THAT'S I

05:41:14.687 --> 05:41:16.923
MEAN THIS ISN'T A THIS ISN'T

05:41:16.989 --> 05:41:18.624
ABOUT TEXAS. AND I UNDERSTAND

05:41:18.691 --> 05:41:20.126
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GOING AT.

05:41:20.193 --> 05:41:21.794
LISTEN, TEXAS DOES NOT HAVE THE

05:41:21.861 --> 05:41:22.662
INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING

05:41:22.728 --> 05:41:24.730
COMMISSION. AND THIS WHETHER WE

05:41:24.797 --> 05:41:25.932
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT OR NOT.

05:41:25.998 --> 05:41:27.300
THIS STARTED WITH DEMOCRAT

05:41:27.366 --> 05:41:28.634
GROUPS SUING THE STATE OF TEXAS

05:41:28.701 --> 05:41:31.170
FOR THEIR MAPS. AND YES, THEN

05:41:31.237 --> 05:41:32.338
AFTERWARDS WE CAN TALK ABOUT

05:41:32.405 --> 05:41:34.774
WHATEVER THE VOTING DISAGREE ON

05:41:34.841 --> 05:41:36.776
IT. SO THEY HAD TO REDO THEIR

05:41:36.843 --> 05:41:38.444
MAPS BECAUSE DEMOCRAT GROUPS

05:41:38.511 --> 05:41:39.645
TOLD THEM THEY HAD TO. THAT'S

05:41:39.712 --> 05:41:41.080
WHAT THIS ALL STARTED WITH. NOW

05:41:41.147 --> 05:41:42.782
DEMOCRATS LIKELY BY OTHER

05:41:42.849 --> 05:41:44.884
THINGS. BUT MY QUESTION IS, IS

05:41:44.951 --> 05:41:47.553
WHAT CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO

05:41:47.620 --> 05:41:48.754
COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA'S

05:41:48.821 --> 05:41:51.023
REQUIREMENT THAT DISTRICTS BE

05:41:51.090 --> 05:41:52.892
CONTIGUOUS AND COMPACT? BECAUSE

05:41:52.959 --> 05:41:54.293
THERE'S ONE DISTRICT THAT IS, I

05:41:54.360 --> 05:41:57.230
BELIEVE, 30 MILES WIDE AND 40

05:41:57.296 --> 05:41:59.799
OR, I'M SORRY, 30 MILES WIDE AND

05:41:59.866 --> 05:42:01.801
400 MILES LONG OR SOMETHING LIKE

05:42:01.868 --> 05:42:02.902
THAT. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE

05:42:02.969 --> 05:42:04.871
CURRENT I, KEVIN KELLY DISTRICT?

05:42:04.937 --> 05:42:06.205
BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE CASE.

05:42:06.272 --> 05:42:07.540
IT GOES FROM LAKE TAHOE TO DEATH

05:42:07.607 --> 05:42:09.141
VALLEY. IS THAT THE DISTRICT?

05:42:09.208 --> 05:42:10.509
NO, THAT EXISTS NOW. THE

05:42:10.576 --> 05:42:11.944
DISTRICT. OKAY. IF WE COULD

05:42:12.011 --> 05:42:13.079
BRING COMMENTS THROUGH THE CHAIR

05:42:13.145 --> 05:42:14.847
HERE AS WELL. LET'S GO AHEAD AND

05:42:14.914 --> 05:42:17.250
HAVE THE VICE CHAIR CONTINUE TO

05:42:17.316 --> 05:42:19.151
ASK HER QUESTIONING OF THE

05:42:19.218 --> 05:42:21.520
AUTHORS. WHAT CONSIDERATION WAS

05:42:21.587 --> 05:42:22.555
GIVEN TO COMPLIANCE WITH

05:42:22.622 --> 05:42:24.991
CALIFORNIA'S REQUIREMENT THAT

05:42:25.057 --> 05:42:27.059
DISTRICTS BE CONTIGUOUS AND

05:42:27.126 --> 05:42:33.165
COMPACT. YEAH. I DON'T HAVE A

05:42:33.232 --> 05:42:35.735
LEGAL ANSWER FOR REDISTRICTING

05:42:35.801 --> 05:42:37.637
COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS AS WELL.

05:42:37.703 --> 05:42:39.605
SO AGAIN, I'M GOING TO CONTINUE

05:42:39.672 --> 05:42:41.874
TO HIT THIS POINT. AND I KNOW

05:42:41.941 --> 05:42:43.609
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT, BUT

05:42:43.676 --> 05:42:46.746
76.7% OF THIS MAP CURRENTLY IS

05:42:46.812 --> 05:42:48.347
BASED OFF OF THE 2020

05:42:48.414 --> 05:42:49.415
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. JUST

05:42:49.482 --> 05:42:51.150
YES OR NO. ALL OF THE

05:42:51.217 --> 05:42:52.218
CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN THEN TO

05:42:52.285 --> 05:42:53.986
THE COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA

05:42:54.053 --> 05:42:55.888
REQUIREMENTS CONTIGUOUS NOW THAN

05:42:55.955 --> 05:42:57.924
THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE. YES, THE

05:42:57.990 --> 05:43:01.227
NEW THE MAPS THAT ARE OUT THERE

05:43:01.294 --> 05:43:02.094
NOW ARE CONTIGUOUS AND MORE

05:43:02.161 --> 05:43:06.332
COMPACT. SO DOES THAT PARTICULAR

05:43:06.399 --> 05:43:08.000
COMPLIANCE RULE THAT I WAS I'M

05:43:08.067 --> 05:43:09.835
NOT PART OF LEADERSHIP, AS MR.

05:43:09.902 --> 05:43:11.404
BENNETT POINTED OUT. SO I DON'T

05:43:11.470 --> 05:43:13.639
KNOW IF THIS WAS HEY, WE NEED TO

05:43:13.706 --> 05:43:15.274
MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THIS. WAS

05:43:15.341 --> 05:43:16.776
IT WAS IT TALKED ABOUT? WAS IT?

05:43:16.842 --> 05:43:19.178
HEY, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

05:43:19.245 --> 05:43:20.546
DOING THIS OR YOU'RE JUST SAYING

05:43:20.613 --> 05:43:21.280
IT'S DONE. AS FAR AS I'M

05:43:21.347 --> 05:43:22.982
CONCERNED, IT'S OKAY IF THE

05:43:23.049 --> 05:43:24.250
COMMISSION'S MAPS ARE ALREADY

05:43:24.317 --> 05:43:25.651
CONSTITUTIONAL AND ENFORCEABLE.

05:43:25.718 --> 05:43:27.186
WHAT PUBLIC INTEREST IS SERVED

05:43:27.253 --> 05:43:30.323
BY PASSING AB 604, BESIDES

05:43:30.389 --> 05:43:30.923
GIVING THE MIDDLE FINGER TO

05:43:30.990 --> 05:43:33.559
PRESIDENT TRUMP? IT'S TAKING

05:43:33.626 --> 05:43:36.295
CARE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. I

05:43:36.362 --> 05:43:38.230
THINK WE'VE GIVEN YOU A LOT OF

05:43:38.297 --> 05:43:41.267
THE DATA. I MEAN, AGAIN, 6.4

05:43:41.334 --> 05:43:43.769
MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE ON

05:43:43.836 --> 05:43:46.305
MEDICARE. AND AS YOU'VE SEEN

05:43:46.372 --> 05:43:47.740
HERE, WE'VE GOT HEALTH WORKERS

05:43:47.807 --> 05:43:49.542
THAT ARE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT

05:43:49.608 --> 05:43:51.243
HAVE SUPPORTED THIS BILL BECAUSE

05:43:51.310 --> 05:43:53.813
3.4 MILLION ARE UNDER ATTACK AND

05:43:53.879 --> 05:43:55.715
MAY LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE BASED

05:43:55.781 --> 05:43:57.717
ON WHAT THIS BIG, BEAUTIFUL,

05:43:57.783 --> 05:43:59.618
UGLY, HORRIBLE BILL JUST DID.

05:43:59.685 --> 05:44:01.420
AND SO THAT IS A DIRECT ATTACK

05:44:01.487 --> 05:44:02.822
ON CALIFORNIANS. AND I DON'T

05:44:02.888 --> 05:44:04.724
KNOW HOW I CAN GO BACK TO MY

05:44:04.790 --> 05:44:06.892
DISTRICT. IF I WERE A REPUBLICAN

05:44:06.959 --> 05:44:07.994
AND SAY, I ALLOWED THIS AND I'M

05:44:08.060 --> 05:44:09.762
NOT EVEN SPEAKING UP ON IT, AND

05:44:09.829 --> 05:44:11.530
I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN FIGHT UP

05:44:11.597 --> 05:44:13.265
AGAINST IT, I'M NOT GOING TO TRY

05:44:13.332 --> 05:44:14.667
TO EVEN IN ONE SLIGHTEST BIT,

05:44:14.734 --> 05:44:18.004
TRY TO CLAIM FIVE MORE SEATS TO

05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:19.772
ACTUALLY PROTECT MY

05:44:19.839 --> 05:44:21.007
CONSTITUENTS, WHICH IS WHAT WE

05:44:21.073 --> 05:44:23.376
WERE ALL DONE, WHICH WE ALL

05:44:23.442 --> 05:44:24.977
DECIDED TO DO WHEN WE TOOK THE

05:44:25.044 --> 05:44:26.379
OATH TO BECOME STATE

05:44:26.445 --> 05:44:28.014
REPRESENTATIVES. AND, YOU KNOW,

05:44:28.080 --> 05:44:29.982
I THINK SNAP BENEFITS,

05:44:30.049 --> 05:44:31.484
EDUCATION, YOU NAME IT, WE'RE

05:44:31.550 --> 05:44:33.019
GETTING A $1 BILLION RANSOM NOW

05:44:33.085 --> 05:44:34.920
FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

05:44:34.987 --> 05:44:38.057
AGAINST UCLA. THIS IS HORRENDOUS

05:44:38.124 --> 05:44:40.393
FOR RESEARCH GRANTS TO I'M GLAD

05:44:40.459 --> 05:44:42.495
YOU BROUGHT UP CANCER RURAL. AND

05:44:42.561 --> 05:44:44.263
JUST A COUPLE MORE MINUTES HERE.

05:44:44.330 --> 05:44:45.631
I'M GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT

05:44:45.698 --> 05:44:46.999
UP BECAUSE I, AS A REPUBLICAN,

05:44:47.066 --> 05:44:48.734
HAVE GONE BACK TO MY DISTRICT

05:44:48.801 --> 05:44:50.369
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ASKING GAVIN

05:44:50.436 --> 05:44:52.104
NEWSOM WHY HE LEFT BILLIONS OF

05:44:52.171 --> 05:44:54.340
DOLLARS READY TO BE REIMBURSED

05:44:54.407 --> 05:44:55.508
FOR MEDI-CAL SYSTEM, THAT HE

05:44:55.574 --> 05:44:57.209
DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO TURN IN

05:44:57.276 --> 05:44:58.244
THE APPLICATION FOR. I HAVE

05:44:58.310 --> 05:44:59.712
FOUGHT FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR

05:44:59.779 --> 05:45:01.247
PROVIDERS IN RURAL HOSPITALS

05:45:01.313 --> 05:45:02.848
BECAUSE THEY ARE LEAVING. SO AS

05:45:02.915 --> 05:45:05.084
A REPUBLICAN, I CAN TELL YOU I'M

05:45:05.151 --> 05:45:06.519
FIGHTING FOR MY CONSTITUENTS.

05:45:06.585 --> 05:45:07.853
BUT THE SAME WAY THAT WE DON'T

05:45:07.920 --> 05:45:09.455
HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE

05:45:09.522 --> 05:45:10.823
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, I DON'T HAVE

05:45:10.890 --> 05:45:12.691
JURISDICTION OVER TEXAS ELECTEDS

05:45:12.758 --> 05:45:14.226
I'M TRYING TO FOCUS ON WHAT I

05:45:14.293 --> 05:45:16.662
CAN DO HERE WITH THE DOLLARS WE

05:45:16.729 --> 05:45:17.630
HAVE HERE. WITH THAT BEING SAID,

05:45:17.696 --> 05:45:19.298
THERE WAS A DISPARAGING COMMENTS

05:45:19.365 --> 05:45:20.199
MADE ABOUT MYSELF AND MY

05:45:20.266 --> 05:45:21.700
COLLEAGUES VOTE ON A

05:45:21.767 --> 05:45:23.602
REDISTRICTING BILL, AND I WOULD

05:45:23.669 --> 05:45:24.570
LIKE TO CLARIFY IF THE CHAIR

05:45:24.637 --> 05:45:27.473
WOULD ALLOW ME THAT VOTE. I'M

05:45:27.540 --> 05:45:29.675
NOT SURE WHAT THIS HAS TO DO

05:45:29.742 --> 05:45:32.812
WITH THE BILL. IT WAS BROUGHT UP

05:45:32.878 --> 05:45:33.979
PREVIOUSLY. OKAY. CAN WE HOLD ON

05:45:34.046 --> 05:45:35.948
THAT? AND WE'LL ALLOW THAT AT

05:45:36.015 --> 05:45:37.616
THE END OF THE HEARING HERE.

05:45:37.683 --> 05:45:40.019
OKAY? OKAY. LET'S TRY TO

05:45:40.086 --> 05:45:44.090
CONTINUE ON AB 604. ANY OTHER

05:45:44.156 --> 05:45:46.092
COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS ON THE

05:45:46.158 --> 05:45:47.993
DAIS? QUICK COMMENTS. I KNOW

05:45:48.060 --> 05:45:49.728
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

05:45:49.795 --> 05:45:50.296
CONVERSATION AND BIPARTISAN

05:45:50.362 --> 05:45:52.565
SUPPORT, WHICH IS AMAZING FOR

05:45:52.631 --> 05:45:53.599
FEDERAL INDEPENDENT

05:45:53.666 --> 05:45:55.167
REDISTRICTING LEGISLATION. THE

05:45:55.234 --> 05:45:57.603
GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A TEMPLATE

05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:59.171
FOR THAT, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN

05:45:59.238 --> 05:46:01.707
PASSED BY THE HOUSE OF

05:46:01.774 --> 05:46:02.341
REPRESENTATIVES AT THE

05:46:02.408 --> 05:46:03.876
CONGRESSIONAL LEVEL. TWICE.

05:46:03.943 --> 05:46:05.544
THERE WAS THE FOR THE PEOPLE ACT

05:46:05.611 --> 05:46:08.481
IN 2019 LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND

05:46:08.547 --> 05:46:10.549
THE FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT IN THE

05:46:10.616 --> 05:46:12.351
2021 LEGISLATIVE SESSION. BOTH

05:46:12.418 --> 05:46:14.220
VERSIONS PASSED THE HOUSE. BOTH

05:46:14.286 --> 05:46:17.056
VERSIONS WERE FILIBUSTERED BY

05:46:17.123 --> 05:46:18.824
UNANIMOUSLY BY REPUBLICANS IN

05:46:18.891 --> 05:46:20.693
THE SENATE. SO WE WOULD HAVE

05:46:20.759 --> 05:46:23.262
THIS IN THE UNITED STATES IF

05:46:23.329 --> 05:46:24.430
REPUBLICANS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

05:46:24.497 --> 05:46:25.798
WOULD SUPPORT IT. I WANT TO

05:46:25.865 --> 05:46:27.633
ENCOURAGE MY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU

THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRACY,

05:46:37.042 --> 05:46:37.610

REPUBLICAN UNITED STATES

05:46:38.477 --> 05:46:39.645
SENATORS THAT ARE BLOCKING THE

05:46:39.712 --> 05:46:41.747
ABILITY FOR US TO HAVE THAT IN

05:46:41.814 --> 05:46:42.748
THE UNITED STATES. AND I WILL
