CHAIRS. ALSO, IN THE INTEREST

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.903

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.739
Q&amp;A SEGMENT, WE'LL HAVE A

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:10.775
LIMITED TIME FOR EACH MEMBER TO

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:13.344
ASK QUESTIONS AS WE DO AN

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.779
INITIAL ROUND, AND I APOLOGIZE

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:16.914
IN ADVANCE IF I CUT YOU OFF

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:17.782
AFTER FIVE MINUTES. SO WITH

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:21.719
THAT, LET'S JUMP INTO THE VERY

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:23.954
IMPORTANT TOPIC OF TODAY'S

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:26.323
HEARING. AS WE'VE NOTED IN

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.192
PREVIOUS OVERSIGHT HEARINGS,

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.627
CALIFORNIA'S FUELS TRANSITION

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:32.696
PLAN IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:33.531
COMPLICATED AND IMPORTANT

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:36.333
CHALLENGES THAT POLICYMAKERS

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.868
MUST NAVIGATE, BOTH TODAY AND

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.703
IN THE DECADE TO COME. WE

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.139
CERTAINLY DO NOT TAKE THIS

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:43.674
CHALLENGE LIGHTLY. THE RECENT

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.910
DECISIONS BY PHILLIPS, 66 AND

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.912
VALERO TO POTENTIALLY SHUTTER

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:50.114
OPERATIONS OF THEIR REFINERIES

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.882
IN WILMINGTON AND BENICIA,

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:54.752
RESPECTIVELY, PROVIDE A PIVOTAL

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.620
MOMENT IN THIS TRANSITION.

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:58.622
WHILE MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:00.191
AMBITIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:01.058
HAVE BEEN SIGNALING THIS

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.627
DECLINE FOR DECADES, THE

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.329
REALITY IS THAT STATE IS

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.697
LARGELY WITHOUT A ROBUST,

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:09.033
SYSTEM WIDE TRANSITION PLAN.

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.801
THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:12.203
COMMISSION, THROUGH THE VICE

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:14.238
CHAIRS OFFICE, HAS PUT FORWARD

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:16.640
A MULTI-PRONGED STRATEGY TO

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:19.009
ADDRESS BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:21.178
TERM IMPACTS OF THESE IMMEDIATE

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:21.912
REFINERY CLOSURES AND THE

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:23.914
LARGER TRANSITION CHALLENGE.

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:26.150
TODAY'S HEARING SEEKS TO

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:27.585
UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTIONS THAT

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:28.786
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:31.288
FORWARD, AND I WILL NOTE BEFORE

00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:32.756
WE JUMP IN, THAT IT IS MY GOAL

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.758
THAT WE REMAIN FOCUSED, NOT

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.727
JUST ON THE VERY IMPORTANT,

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:39.797
URGENT SHORT TERM FIXES, BUT

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.932
ALSO ON THE LONGER TERM

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:42.666
PLANNING THAT IS NECESSARY TO

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:45.035
ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT FIND

00:41:45.102 --> 00:41:46.537
OURSELVES PLAYING A NEVER

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:49.206
ENDING GAME OF WHACK A MOLE AND

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:51.675
ADDRESSING THESE ON IN A CRISIS

00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:53.744
RESPONSE. SO WITH THAT WELCOME,

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:56.080
CHAIR WILSON, CHAIR BRIAN AND

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:59.016
I'LL TURN TO OUR CO-CHAIRS FOR

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:01.719
THEIR OPENING REMARKS. THANK

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.520
YOU. CHAIR. PETRIE-NORRIS.

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:04.822
THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:06.090
THIS COMMITTEE FOR PRIORITIZING

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.791
THE TIMES AND THOSE NEW

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.293
ADDITIONS TO BE INVOLVED IN

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.328
SUCH A CRITICAL CONVERSATION.

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:13.664
AND WE FIND OURSELVES HERE

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:15.232
REALLY BECAUSE WE ARE

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:18.035
TRANSITIONING, BUT WE'RE ALSO

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:21.505
FINDING THAT THE RATE OF OUR

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:22.940
TRANSITION FOR PETROLEUM SUPPLY

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:25.843
DOES NOT MATCH THE DEMAND. AND

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.678
THAT IS WHY THIS IMPORTANT

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:28.812
CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING, AS

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.014
YOU CAN IMAGINE, AS YOU'VE

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.781
WATCHED THE HEADLINES,

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:32.149
ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.817
CALIFORNIA, THERE'S A LOT OF

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.552
MAJOR TOPICS HAPPENING THAT WE

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:36.687
ARE TRYING TO RESOLVE IN THE

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:38.756
LAST FEW WEEKS OF THE SESSION,

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.658
AND THIS IS JUST AS CRITICALLY

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:42.693
IMPORTANT. IT INVOLVES

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.961
COMMUNITIES. IT INVOLVES

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:46.063
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. IT

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.899
INVOLVES INDUSTRY THAT PROVIDES

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:51.769
JOBS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.504
INVOLVES WHAT DOES A CLEAN

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.806
FUTURE LOOK LIKE FOR US? WHAT

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:58.042
DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO HAVE CLEAN

00:42:58.108 --> 00:42:59.977
AIR, CLEAN WATER, AND A HEALTHY

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:01.045
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE CAN LEAVE

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:02.780
TO OUR CHILDREN AND ENSURE THAT

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:03.881
ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT BE REGRESSING

00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:05.749
IN OTHER AREAS, ESPECIALLY AS

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:08.185
IT RELATES TO OUR FEDERAL

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:08.686
PARTNERS, THAT WE'RE NOT

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.054
REGRESSING IN WHAT IS CRITICAL

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.822
TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:15.192
HEALTH, AND WHAT IS CRITICAL TO

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:15.926
CALIFORNIA'S VALUES. NOW, OUR

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:17.628
TRANSPORTATION FUEL MARKET IS

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:19.463
UNIQUE AND RELATIVELY ISOLATED,

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.199
PARTIALLY DUE TO THE CRITICAL

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:23.300
NEED TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:26.537
UNIQUE AIR QUALITIES. WE ALSO

00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:27.905
KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA,

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:30.708
REFINERIES ARE MAJOR LOCAL

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:31.809
EMPLOYERS PROVIDING HIGH RISK

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:34.011
AND OFTEN HIGH PAYING JOBS AND

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:37.014
A ROBUST TAX BASE TO THEIR

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.650
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. REFINERY

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:41.652
CAPACITY IN THIS STATE IS

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:42.720
HIGHLY REGIONALIZED AND

00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:45.255
CONSOLIDATED, WHICH ADDS TO THE

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:46.590
RISK OF ABRUPT DISRUPTIONS

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:50.194
DURING OUTAGES. AND AT THE SAME

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.095
TIME, WE KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.629
LOCATED NEAR REFINERIES AND OIL

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:54.832
AND GAS EXTRACTION

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:56.333
INFRASTRUCTURE BEAR THE BRUNT

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.134
OF POLLUTION IN THE STATE AND

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:59.003
HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:01.972
NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOME. BUT AS

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:03.073
REFINERIES CLOSE AND

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.608
CONSOLIDATE ACROSS THE GLOBE,

00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:06.844
WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR FUTURE

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.412
REFINERY CLOSURES, CLOSURES

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:11.048
WITH TARGETED STRATEGIES TO

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:11.682
SUPPORT THE TRANSITION,

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:14.184
INCLUDING STABILIZING SUPPLY,

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:17.054
MINIMIZING PRICE SHOCKS AND

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:18.922
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES, AND

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.725
SUPPORTING OUR WORKERS. NOW,

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:23.160
WHILE THE STATE CONTINUES TO

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:25.362
WORK TOWARDS OUR GOALS OF

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:26.830
CARBON NEUTRALITY, WE ARE

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.565
FACING AN HISTORIC MOMENT TO

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:30.801
NAVIGATE A MANAGED TRANSITION

00:44:30.868 --> 00:44:33.604
INTO A ZERO EMISSION FUTURE.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.906
AND THIS MOMENT IS

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:36.907
UNPRECEDENTED AND WILL TAKE A

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.275
THOUGHTFUL AND COLLABORATIVE

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:41.111
APPROACH WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:43.247
PRESENT. AND I APPRECIATE VICE

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:44.915
CHAIR GUNDA FOR LEADING THOSE

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:47.051
CONVERSATIONS UP TO THIS POINT.

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:49.086
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NAVIGATE

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:52.456
SMOOTHLY, AND THIS HEARING IS A

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:53.624
PART OF WHAT'S MAKING THAT

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:58.328
HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:44:58.395 --> 00:45:00.898
CHAIR BRIAN. THANK YOU, MADAM

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:03.067
CHAIRS AND COLLEAGUES, AND

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:04.668
THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE FOLKS

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:06.003
WHO CAME OUT TODAY, ESPECIALLY

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:06.904
THOSE WHO LIVE NEAR

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.005
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:09.706
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND FOUND

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:12.142
TIME IN YOUR DAY TO MAKE IT UP

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:12.976
TO SACRAMENTO. OUR GOAL IS TO

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.011
MANAGE A TRANSITION TOWARDS

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.746
CLEANER FUELS WHILE BALANCING

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:16.613
AFFORDABILITY. AND THAT'S NO

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.715
SMALL, UNCOMPLICATED MATTER.

00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:20.684
CALIFORNIA IS STRIVING TO REACH

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.853
CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2025,

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.455
WHICH IS INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS

00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:27.591
AND NECESSARY, BUT STILL

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:28.826
CHALLENGING TO ACHIEVE. OVER MY

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:30.961
TENURE IN THE ASSEMBLY, WE'VE

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:32.963
PASSED A MYRIAD OF LAWS TO

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.132
REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON OIL AND

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:35.632
FOSSIL FUELS, REDUCE AND

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.668
MITIGATE INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION,

00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:38.869
ESTABLISH HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:40.070
PROTECTION ZONES TO RESTRICT

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:41.738
NEW DRILLING NEAR COMMUNITIES,

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:43.774
REQUIRE PERMANENT CLOSURES FOR

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:45.576
IDLE WELLS AND CURB LOW

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:47.744
PRODUCTION WELLS. BUT STILL,

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:49.580
OUR DEMAND ON FOSSIL FUELS IS

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:50.848
GREATER THAN OUR TRANSITION HAS

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:53.984
BEEN UP TO THIS POINT. WE STILL

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.719
HAVE SOME WORK TO DO TO GET

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:56.954
THIS BALANCE RIGHT, AND I'M

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.489
LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM

00:45:58.555 --> 00:45:59.823
YOU ALL TODAY IN THIS HEARING,

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.958
AND GRATEFUL TO ALL OF MY

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:02.793
COLLEAGUES WHO COULD JOIN US

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.128
HERE ON THE DAIS. THANK YOU.

00:46:04.194 --> 00:46:05.729
ALL RIGHT. SO WE ARE GOING TO

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:08.432
GO AHEAD AND HEAR FROM OUR

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:11.235
FIRST PANELISTS. WE'VE INVITED

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.536
PROFESSOR EMILY GRUBERT FROM

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.771
THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME TO

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.907
PROVIDE SOME OPENING REMARKS

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:19.076
AND HELP US TO FRAME THIS

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:20.310
DISCUSSION. I BELIEVE PROFESSOR

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:23.413
GRUBERT IS JOINING US REMOTELY.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.749
WELCOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:27.718
CHAIRS, AND THANK YOU, EVERYONE,

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:28.752
FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME AND

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.754
SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF THIS

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:31.855
AFTERNOON WITH YOU. I WANT TO

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:33.924
JUST IN THESE BRIEF OPENING

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:34.825
REMARKS, MAKE THREE BIG POINTS.

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:36.660
AND THEN I REALLY LOOK FORWARD

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:38.061
TO A CONVERSATION QUESTION AND

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.563
ANSWERS. AND I SHOULD SAY AT

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.265
THE BEGINNING, I'M AN ASSOCIATE

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:42.099
PROFESSOR AT NOTRE DAME AND

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:43.600
ALSO A CONSULTANT TO THE CDC ON

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:45.035
SOME OF THESE TRANSITION ISSUES.

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:46.670
I THINK THE FIRST THING I WANT

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:48.739
TO START WITH IS JUST TO THANK

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:51.141
YOU FOR YOUR WORK. THIS IS ONE

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:51.742
OF THESE. THE NOTION OF FOSSIL

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:52.809
TRANSITION IS ONE OF THESE

00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:55.379
THINGS THAT IS ENORMOUSLY,

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:56.446
ENORMOUSLY CHALLENGING AND

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:58.715
ENORMOUSLY GLOBAL. CALIFORNIA

00:46:58.782 --> 00:46:59.983
IS AMONG THE FIRST THAT'S

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.618
ACTUALLY DEALING WITH MANY OF

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:02.786
THESE QUESTIONS OF MANAGED

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:04.254
TRANSITION. AND REALLY THE

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:04.888
PARTICULAR CONSIDERATION OF HOW

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.690
YOU ACTUALLY ENSURE THAT THIS

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:08.792
IS DONE IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:09.560
PEOPLE AND PROTECTS THE

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:10.661
ENVIRONMENT, WHILE ALSO

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:12.062
ENSURING THAT THE PROCESS IS

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:13.764
SMOOTH. CALIFORNIA IS NOT ALONE,

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.732
BUT IT IS EARLY ON WHAT THIS

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:16.800
ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE. AND SO

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.769
MAYBE THE POINT THAT I'D LIKE

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:19.736
TO EMPHASIZE AS YOU DO THIS

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:20.837
VERY DIFFICULT WORK IS THAT

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:22.906
THIS PROBLEM IS NOT GOING TO GO

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:24.775
AWAY. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE OF 1

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:27.044
OR 2 REFINERIES. IT'S NOT EVEN

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:27.911
REALLY AN ISSUE OF NINE

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:28.679
REFINERIES. WHAT HAPPENS AS WE

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:29.947
THINK ABOUT MANAGED TRANSITION

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.615
IN THE REFINING SECTOR IS ALSO

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:34.017
GOING TO COLOR A LOT OF HOW WE

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:34.885
THINK ABOUT WHAT SUCCESSFUL

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:37.154
POLICY LOOKS LIKE AS WE START

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:37.821
TO TRANSITION GAS BASED HEATING,

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.723
AS WE START TO TRANSITION THE

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:40.991
POWER SECTOR AND EVERYWHERE

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:42.626
ELSE WHERE WE USE FOSSIL FUELS,

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:43.794
AS WE'RE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.128
THIS SMOOTH, MANAGED TRANSITION

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:47.664
TO A A FUTURE THAT IS LIKELY TO

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.066
BE MUCH, MUCH EASIER TO MANAGE

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.601
ONCE WE'RE NO LONGER IN THIS

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:51.802
CHALLENGING POINT OF HAVING TO

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:53.870
MANAGE BOTH FOSSIL AND

00:47:53.937 --> 00:47:55.672
NON-FOSSIL SYSTEMS. SO THIS IS

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:56.707
IMPORTANT WORK AND IT'S NOT

00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.141
GOING AWAY. THE SECOND MAJOR

00:47:58.208 --> 00:47:59.610
POINT THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:00.777
RIGHT UP FRONT IS THAT IN

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:02.846
GENERAL, I THINK WHAT WE SEE AS

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:04.881
A PRETTY CONSISTENT THING FROM

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:05.749
OTHER INDUSTRIES, OTHER

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.818
CONTEXTS, AND IN THIS ONE AS

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:08.719
WELL, IS THAT THE PUBLIC

00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:11.788
ALREADY OWNS THE RISK OF

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:12.823
TRANSITION WHEN LARGE

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:15.158
FACILITIES GO BANKRUPT OR EXIT

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:16.660
SUDDENLY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS,

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:17.928
IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:19.696
CRITICAL ENOUGH THAT IT'S

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:20.731
ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO CONTINUE

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:21.965
TO PROVIDING SERVICES TO

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:22.699
CALIFORNIANS OR ANYONE ELSE

00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:25.168
WHO'S AFFECTED, THERE IS,

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:27.604
GENERALLY SPEAKING, A PUBLIC

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:30.107
OBLIGATION TO EITHER MAINTAIN

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:31.675
CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS OR

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.744
OTHERWISE KIND OF STABILIZE

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.379
THESE SYSTEMS IN A WAY THAT

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:36.213
MEANS THAT THE LIABILITY IS

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.781
ALREADY WITH THE PUBLIC. THIS

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:39.182
ALSO APPLIES TO ASSET

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:39.983
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND WE

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.718
EXPECT THAT IN THE CASE OF

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.787
REALLY LARGE INDUSTRIAL SITES,

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:45.122
THAT SOME OF THE REMEDIATION

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:45.756
REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:46.957
FACILITIES IS GOING TO BE QUITE

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:48.659
LARGE. IN THE COAL INDUSTRY, WE

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.927
SEE QUITE A LOT OF REMEDIATION

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.262
OBLIGATIONS PASSING BACK TO THE

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:53.196
PUBLIC THROUGH BANKRUPTCIES AND

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:54.698
SUCH. SO THE PUBLIC ALREADY

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.767
OWNS THE RISK HERE. AND A LOT

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:58.201
OF THE POLICY OPTIONS THAT I

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.703
THINK WE THINK ABOUT DEEPLY ON

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.904
THE RESEARCH SIDE ARE REALLY

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.873
HOW THE PUBLIC CAN ALSO OWN

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:03.674
SOME OF THE BENEFIT OF A

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.675
WELL-MANAGED TRANSITION. AND

00:49:04.741 --> 00:49:05.976
THEN I THINK THE THIRD POINT

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:08.645
THAT I'D LIKE TO START WITH IS

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:09.713
JUST THIS REALLY DOES SET THE

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:10.814
TONE HOW THE STATE OF

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.015
CALIFORNIA DEALS WITH THE

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:12.749
TRANSITION OF REFINING, REALLY

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:15.052
IS GOING TO INFORM THE WAY THAT

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.621
MANY, MANY OTHER TRANSITIONS

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.790
OCCUR. I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED

00:49:19.856 --> 00:49:20.724
IN THE OPENING REMARKS A MOMENT

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.726
AGO THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD NOT

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.528
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IN

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:25.629
CRISIS MODE EVERY TIME. SO

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:26.997
AGAIN, THIS IS NOT THE QUESTION

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.999
OF 1 OR 2 REFINERIES. THIS IS

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:30.267
REALLY THE ENTIRE FOSSIL SYSTEM.

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:31.935
AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:33.670
THAT WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS GOING

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:34.838
TO INFORM HOW ADDITIONAL

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:35.739
INDUSTRIES AND ADDITIONAL

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:37.040
FACILITIES THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:38.575
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO. SO IN

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:39.710
A SETTING WHERE THERE'S THE

00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:41.211
POTENTIAL FOR PRETTY

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:41.878
SIGNIFICANT EXTRACTIVISM IN

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.580
TERMS OF REQUIRING STATE

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:44.748
FUNDING AND SUCH FOR

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:45.882
STABILIZING SOME OF THESE

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:47.551
MARKETS. I THINK A MAJOR

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:48.719
QUESTION TO KEEP IN MIND IS

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.787
JUST WHAT THE STATE IS GETTING

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:52.055
IN RETURN FOR SOME OF THIS

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:52.856
ACTIVITY. SO THANK YOU VERY

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.758
MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:56.893
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU PROFESSOR.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.228
WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US.

00:49:58.295 --> 00:49:59.963
MEMBERS. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.065
IS HEAR FROM THE PANELISTS FROM

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:02.933
OUR NEXT PANEL BEFORE WE THEN

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:05.535
OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS FOR

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:06.636
PROFESSOR GRUBERT AS WELL AS

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:08.805
OUR OTHER PANELISTS. SO WE'LL

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:11.608
GO AHEAD NOW AND WELCOME. LET'S

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:14.044
SEE. WE WE HAVE INVITED CARB

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:17.047
CHAIR LIANE RANDOLPH, CÁC VICE

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:18.548
CHAIR FOR DEPARTMENT OF

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:21.284
CONSERVATION DIRECTOR JENNIFER

00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:23.320
LUCCHESE, AND MAYOR OF BENICIA

00:50:23.387 --> 00:50:26.890
STEVE YOUNG. WELCOME. THANK YOU

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:29.693
SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.130
AFTERNOON, AND THANK YOU FOR

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:34.765
HAVING US. I AM GOING TO START

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:37.634
WITH A PRESENTATION TO SORT OF

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.903
KIND OF SET THE STAGE FOR WHERE

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.006
WE ARE TODAY. I'M LIANE

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.875
RANDOLPH, I AM THE CHAIR OF THE

00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:46.109
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.644
AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.780
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:50.847
CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:53.250
FUEL MARKET. CARB IS CHARGED

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:54.584
WITH PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:55.719
THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF AIR

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:56.887
POLLUTION, AND DEVELOPING

00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:58.822
PROGRAMS AND ACTIONS TO FIGHT

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.657
CLIMATE CHANGE. MANY OF THE

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.726
STRATEGIES WE USE TO ADDRESS

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:03.727
CLIMATE CHANGE ARE THE SAME

00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:06.296
STRATEGIES THAT WILL ALSO

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:08.365
IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND PUBLIC

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:09.599
HEALTH. FOSSIL FUEL USE IN

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:11.868
VEHICLE IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:12.669
SOURCE OF CLIMATE AND AIR

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:15.071
POLLUTION IN THE STATE, AND

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:17.641
ACCORDINGLY, CARB'S REGULATIONS

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:19.242
ARE DESIGNED TO DECREASE DEMAND

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:22.245
FOR FOSSIL FUEL. LET'S GO TO

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:38.495
THE SLIDES.

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:41.998
I CAN CONTINUE ON

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:44.067
WHILE THE SLIDES ARE GOING.

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:47.170
OKAY. ALL OF THIS BEGAN WITH AB

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:50.707
32, WHICH REQUIRES FUEL USE TO

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:51.875
BE CUT DRASTICALLY TO REACH THE

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.677
GOALS IN STATUTE. THOSE

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:55.712
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS PRIMARILY

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.881
COME FROM ZERO EMISSION CARS,

00:51:57.948 --> 00:51:59.716
TRUCKS, AND CLEAN FUELS. OUR

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.918
CLEAN VEHICLE PROGRAMS INCLUDE

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:04.054
RULES TO ADVANCE ZERO EMISSION

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.721
VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT AND

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.089
INCENTIVES, WHICH ARE

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:06.823
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.226
OF CURRENT FEDERAL DISRUPTION.

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:11.294
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD,

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:12.863
OR LCFS, IS A CRITICAL PART OF

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.965
THE STATE'S APPROACH TO MAKING

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:16.066
FUEL LESS POLLUTING BY

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:17.934
ENCOURAGING THE PRODUCTION OF

00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:19.803
CLEANER ALTERNATIVES, WHICH ARE

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.905
NEEDED TO DISPLACE FOSSIL FUELS

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:22.973
AND REDUCE TRANSPORTATION

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:25.709
SECTOR EMISSIONS. TOGETHER WITH

00:52:25.775 --> 00:52:27.744
OUR SISTER AGENCIES, WE ARE

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:30.113
ENGAGED IN ONGOING

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.414
COLLABORATION, COMMUNICATION

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:33.149
AND PLANNING NEEDED TO MOVE

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:36.019
SMOOTHLY THROUGH THIS

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:38.188
TRANSITION PROCESS. THE

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.689
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. LET'S GO

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:41.758
TO THE NEXT SLIDE. REMAINS THE

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.126
LARGEST SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.661
MAN MADE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:47.163
EMISSIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR OVER

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.098
50%. WHEN YOU INCLUDE

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:49.733
EXTRACTION. TRANSPORTATION IS

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.568
ALSO THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF NOX

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:54.070
EMISSIONS, WHICH ARE A MAJOR

00:52:54.137 --> 00:52:56.139
COMPONENT OF WHAT CREATES SMOG.

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.707
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES LIKE TRUCKS,

00:52:57.774 --> 00:52:59.843
BUSSES, TRAINS, SHIPS, AND

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.678
PLANES ACCOUNT FOR OVER 60% OF

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:03.680
THE STATE'S NOX EMISSIONS,

00:53:03.747 --> 00:53:04.881
HEAVILY IMPACTING MAJOR

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:08.351
TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS. NEXT

00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:10.720
SLIDE. THE US EPA SETS HEALTH

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:13.323
BASED AIR QUALITY STANDARD, AND

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.592
DESPITE MAJOR CHALLENGES, WE

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:18.094
HAVE SEEN INCREDIBLE

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.596
IMPROVEMENT. NOX EMISSIONS HAVE

00:53:19.663 --> 00:53:22.766
DROPPED NEARLY 70% SINCE THE

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.901
1970S DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:27.170
VEHICLE RULES, WHICH HAVE

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:27.837
DIRECTLY RESULTED IN THE

00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:29.606
DEVELOPMENT OF MAJOR

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:31.775
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS.

00:53:31.841 --> 00:53:33.643
THIS CHART SHOWS THE PROGRESS

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.945
WE'VE MADE IN THE LAST 20 YEARS

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:38.381
AND HOW FAR WE STILL NEED TO GO.

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:39.849
NEXT SLIDE. CARB AND THE AIR

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.718
DISTRICTS ALSO SEEK TO REDUCE

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:43.720
RISK FROM EXPOSURE TO AIR

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.822
TOXICS, WHICH COME FROM

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:46.523
REFINERIES, SMALLER SOURCES

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.692
LIKE GAS STATIONS, AND MOBILE

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.594
SOURCES LIKE DIESEL TRUCKS. OUR

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.830
AIR TOXICS PROGRAMS BEGAN IN

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.532
1983, AND HAS SINCE IDENTIFIED

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:57.734
OVER 200 SUBSTANCES THAT ARE

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:58.969
HAZARDOUS TO HUMAN HEALTH,

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:00.937
INCLUDING LEAD, BENZENE,

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:03.540
POLYTHENE, ASBESTOS AND OTHER

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:06.009
TOXICS. WE HAVE ADOPTED

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:07.243
NUMEROUS REGULATIONS TO REDUCE

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:08.612
EMISSIONS AND EXPOSURE,

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:11.081
INCLUDING LIMITING THE LEVELS

00:54:11.147 --> 00:54:12.182
OF BENZENE IN GASOLINE AND

00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:13.550
PHASING OUT THE USE OF

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:15.752
CARCINOGENS AT DRY CLEANERS.

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.053
TODAY, THE STATE'S EFFORTS

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.722
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON REDUCING

00:54:18.788 --> 00:54:19.823
EMISSIONS OF DIESEL

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:21.858
PARTICULATES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:24.127
70% OF TOTAL KNOWN CANCER RISK

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:25.195
RELATED TO TOXIC AIR

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:28.999
CONTAMINANTS. NEXT SLIDE.

00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:30.000
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN REGULATING

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:31.568
GASOLINE TO REDUCE AIR

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:33.770
POLLUTION SINCE 1971, WHEN THE

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:35.939
REALITY OF SMOG AND THE

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:37.140
SOLUTION TO REDUCING IT BECAME

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:39.376
CLEAR. OUR STANDARDS FOR

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.111
GASOLINE HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:42.245
SEVERAL TIMES, ADDRESSING

00:54:42.312 --> 00:54:43.813
EMERGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:44.881
CONCERNS. EMERGING

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.249
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SUCH AS

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:48.551
REMOVING LEAD IN 1974 AND

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:53.223
PHASING OUT MTBE IN 1999. THE

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:54.791
FUEL STANDARDS WE USE TODAY

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:56.826
WERE FIRST ESTABLISHED IN 2000

00:54:56.893 --> 00:55:00.130
BY CARB, AND HAVE PROVIDED

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:00.864
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN OZONE

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.700
FORMING POLLUTANTS. THE LAST

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:05.368
REVISION TO OUR REFORMULATED

00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:08.238
GASOLINE STANDARD WAS IN 2007.

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:10.874
NEXT SLIDE CALIFORNIA HAS TWO

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.709
DIFFERENT BLENDS OF FUEL KNOWN

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:14.411
AS SUMMER BLEND AND WINTER

00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:16.613
BLEND. SUMMER FUEL HAS A

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.814
VOLATILITY LIMIT TO HELP LIMIT

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:20.116
OZONE FORMATION, WHICH IS

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:21.618
ANOTHER MAJOR COMPONENT OF WHAT

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.987
CREATES SMOG. WHEN CONTROLLING

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:27.090
OZONE, FORMATION IS LESS

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:28.792
CRITICAL TO MEETING AIR QUALITY

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:29.626
STANDARDS. THE STATE USES

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.895
WINTER BLEND, WHICH IS CHEAPER.

00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:33.997
THE USE OF THESE FUELS IS

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.699
INCLUDED IN THE STATE'S

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:36.933
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO ACHIEVE

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.069
FEDERALLY MANDATED AIR QUALITY

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:42.005
GOALS, MAKING THE USE OF THAT

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:44.941
FUEL REQUIRED. NEXT SLIDE.

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.976
DESPITE OUR SUCCESS REDUCING

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:48.978
NOX EMISSIONS AND TOXIC AIR

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:50.980
CONTAMINANTS, MORE WORK IS

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:53.717
NEEDED. MORE THAN 18 MILLION

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:55.018
CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN AREAS THAT

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:56.553
EXCEED FEDERAL OZONE STANDARDS,

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:59.823
AND FIVE OF THE TEN CITIES WITH

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.891
THE WORST AIR QUALITY ARE IN

00:56:01.958 --> 00:56:04.961
CALIFORNIA. OVER 5000 PREMATURE

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.663
DEATHS OCCUR AS A RESULT OF

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.799
EXPOSURE TO PM 2.5 POLLUTION,

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.735
WHICH IS MOSTLY PRODUCED BY

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:15.739
MOBILE SOURCES, AND THE IMPACTS

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:20.276
OF THOSE HEALTH EXPOSURES

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:22.779
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT LOW

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.647
INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:28.618
COMMUNITIES. NEXT SLIDE. WE OF

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:31.121
COURSE NEED TO DISCUSS THE

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:33.022
ILLEGAL APPROVAL OF THE

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.290
CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:36.793
RESOLUTIONS BY THE US SENATE

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.194
PURPORTING TO DISAPPROVE

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.796
CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR ACT

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:41.564
WAIVERS FOR OUR CLEAN CAR AND

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:44.734
CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAMS. WE ARE IN

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.770
LITIGATION ON THIS TOPIC AND WE

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.938
ARE CONFIDENT WE WILL PREVAIL,

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:51.241
BUT IT WILL TAKE YEARS TO

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.742
ACHIEVE THAT RESOLUTION. AND IN

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:55.044
THE MEANTIME, WE NEED TO ENSURE

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:56.146
THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:59.916
PROGRESS. WE RECENTLY ISSUED A

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:01.584
JOINT AGENCY REPORT THAT

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:03.353
IDENTIFIED SEVERAL OPTIONS FOR

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:05.188
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:07.323
THAT ARE ACTIONS THAT ARE NOT

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.892
SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AUTHORITY,

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:11.427
INCLUDING THE INDIRECT SOURCE

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:13.563
RULE FOR LARGE MULTI POINT

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.732
SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION AND

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:17.567
ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES THAT WILL

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:20.036
BE IMPORTANT TO DRIVE VOLUNTARY

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:21.871
ACTION THAT WILL OFFSET SOME OF

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:24.174
THE EXPECTED EMISSIONS

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:24.774
REDUCTION RESULTS THAT WE HAVE

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:30.013
LOST. CAN WE GO TO THE PREVIOUS

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:36.953
SLIDE? OKAY. WHILE MUCH OF THIS

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:37.821
PRESENTATION DISCUSSES THE AIR

00:57:37.887 --> 00:57:40.223
QUALITY AND CLIMATE BENEFITS OF

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.058
THIS FUELS TRANSITION, AS WE

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.827
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE AIR

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.762
POLLUTION THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.664
ADDRESS, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.532
TO NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL CLEAN

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:52.969
AIR ACT REQUIRES THE US EPA TO

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:54.504
SET NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:56.739
QUALITY STANDARDS THAT GET

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:58.541
REEVALUATED EVERY FIVE YEARS.

00:57:58.608 --> 00:58:00.677
MANY OF OUR CLIMATE REGULATIONS

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:01.945
ARE INCLUDED IN THE STATE

00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:05.014
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO ACHIEVE

00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:07.617
THESE STANDARDS. SO INACTION OR

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:10.420
LOOSENING OF THESE REGULATIONS,

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:11.654
INCLUDING OUR REGULATIONS

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:14.324
AROUND LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.892
DUTY VEHICLES, COULD RESULT IN

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:17.660
FAILING TO MEET THESE STANDARDS.

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:19.529
AND THERE ARE VARIOUS

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:21.097
CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:22.932
MEET THESE STANDARDS, SUCH AS

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.567
STATIONARY SOURCES SUCH AS

00:58:24.634 --> 00:58:27.070
SANCTIONS ON STATIONARY SOURCES

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.372
AND THE LOSS OF FEDERAL HIGHWAY

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:31.741
FUNDING. THESE SANCTIONS ARE

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.843
NOT THEORETICAL. IN OCTOBER OF

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.778
LAST YEAR, WE WERE DAYS AWAY

00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:38.147
FROM HIGHWAY SANCTIONS IN THE

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:39.349
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE WERE

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:42.085
ABLE TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE. BUT

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:42.785
THAT THREAT IS REAL, AND THAT

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:46.089
WAS UNDER A FRIENDLY

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:47.123
ADMINISTRATION. OKAY. NOW LET'S

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.826
GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I THINK

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:51.461
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:52.629
THAT CALIFORNIA'S WORK IS THE

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:54.163
RESULT OF LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION.

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.999
AB 32, AS I MENTIONED,

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:57.533
ESTABLISHED THE STATE'S FIRST

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.802
CLIMATE TARGETS FOR 2020, WHICH

00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.738
WERE ACHIEVED SIX YEARS EARLY.

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:04.173
AND MOST RECENTLY, THE

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:04.908
LEGISLATURE ADOPTED A NEW

00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:06.676
CLIMATE GOAL OF CARBON

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:09.979
NEUTRALITY BY 2045. AND EVERY

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:11.814
FIVE YEARS, CARB UPDATES ITS

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:14.751
SCOPING PLAN TO THAT OUTLINES

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:18.588
HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE CLIMATE

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:23.126
TARGETS. NEXT SLIDE. IN RECENT

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:23.927
YEARS, THE GOVERNOR AND

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:24.661
LEGISLATURE WORKED TOGETHER TO

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:26.696
PASS A SUITE OF CLIMATE

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:30.066
LEGISLATION TARGETED AT CARBON

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:30.934
NEUTRALITY AND CARBON DIOXIDE

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.539
REMOVAL, AND CARB STAFF HAVE

00:59:36.606 --> 00:59:38.675
TAKEN THESE NEW STATUTORY

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:39.842
REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED HERE.

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.644
THEY ARE REFLECTED IN THE MOST

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:45.148
RECENT 2022 SCOPING PLAN UPDATE.

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:46.549
THEY INCLUDE ESTABLISHING

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.351
CARBON NEUTRALITY AS A GOAL. AS

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:49.585
I MENTIONED, ESTABLISHING

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:51.955
INTERIM CLEAN ELECTRICITY

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:54.590
TARGETS TO ACHIEVE SB 100,

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:55.792
ESTABLISHING A CARBON CAPTURE,

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:58.928
UTILIZATION AND STORAGE PROGRAM,

00:59:58.995 --> 00:59:59.529
ESTABLISHING HEALTH PROTECTIVE

00:59:59.595 --> 01:00:01.197
ZONES AROUND OIL AND GAS

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:02.598
INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH WE WILL

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:05.034
DISCUSS, AND PROVIDING

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:06.102
DIRECTION ON INCORPORATING

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:07.870
CLEAN HYDROGEN AND NATURAL AND

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:08.805
WORKING LANDS IN THE STATE'S

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:11.240
CARBON NEUTRALITY EFFORTS. NEXT

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:15.745
SLIDE. THE LOW CARBON FUEL

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:16.612
STANDARD WAS CREATED AS AN

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:18.748
EARLY ACTION MEASURE UNDER AB

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:21.617
32. THE ADOPTION OF LCFS AND

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:24.220
EACH SET OF AMENDMENTS TO THE

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.555
REGULATION WAS CONDUCTED WITH A

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:27.023
ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS,

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:30.126
INCLUDING MULTI-YEAR INFORMAL

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:31.594
RULEMAKING PROCESSES, AS WELL

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:32.762
AS THE FORMAL ONE YEAR

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:34.764
RULEMAKING PROCESS THAT

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:35.665
INCLUDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:38.134
STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.268
ASSESSMENT, WHICH EVALUATES THE

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.470
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.805
REGULATION ON THE STATE'S

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.540
ECONOMY. AND AS WITH ALL OF OUR

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:46.876
AB 32 MEASURES, THE LOW CARBON

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.945
FUEL STANDARD IS REQUIRED TO BE

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:49.512
TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE AND

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:52.081
COST EFFECTIVE, AND IT'S A KEY

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:52.882
TOOL TO TRANSFORMING THE

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:55.084
STATE'S FUEL MARKET. IT

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:57.286
ESTABLISHES AN ANNUAL DECLINE

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:58.888
IN CARBON INTENSITY TARGET FOR

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:01.391
TRANSPORTATION FUELS SHOWN IN

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:04.060
THIS CHART. THE LOWER CARBON OR

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:04.861
CLEANER THE FUEL IS, THE MORE

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:06.996
CREDITS IT CAN GENERATE. FUELS

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:08.865
THAT EXCEED THE STANDARD

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.967
GENERATE DEFICITS. FUEL

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.802
PROVIDERS THEN PURCHASE CREDITS

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.871
TO EQUAL THEIR DEFICITS. THIS

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.739
CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR ALL

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:18.741
FUELS TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.610
INTENSITY, AS WELL AS THE

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:23.112
INTRODUCTION OF CLEAN FUELS TO

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.014
PROVIDE A SOURCE OF CREDITS.

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.716
SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:29.018
PROGRAM NEXT SLIDE, LCFS HAS

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.354
PROVIDED MANY BENEFITS TO

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:33.256
SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.758
AND CLIMATE GOALS, INCLUDING

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.794
DISPLACING OVER 31 BILLION

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.128
GALLONS OF PETROLEUM FUELS WITH

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:43.533
LOW CARBON FUELS AND GENERATING

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.935
$4 BILLION ANNUALLY TO SUPPORT

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.438
LOW CARBON INVESTMENTS,

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:50.173
INCLUDING TRANSIT. IT GIVES

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:53.242
CONSUMER OPTIONS WITH OVER 200

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:55.278
FUEL PROVIDERS NOW IN THE

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:59.682
PROGRAM. I HAVE TO NOTE, WE

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.784
HEARD DIRE PREDICTIONS THAT THE

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:02.785
MOST RECENT SET OF AMENDMENTS

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:04.921
TO THE PROGRAM WOULD RESULT IN

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.723
SKYROCKETING PRICES AT THE PUMP.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:10.093
THOSE AMENDMENTS CAME INTO

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.795
FORCE ON JULY 1ST, 2025, AND

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:15.431
THOSE DIRE PREDICTIONS HAVE NOT

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:16.666
MATERIALIZED. AT THE END OF

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:19.135
JUNE, GAS PRICES IN CALIFORNIA

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:21.804
AVERAGED $4.56. AT THE START OF

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.107
THIS MONTH, THE AVERAGE PRICE

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:27.143
WAS $4.39. WE KNOW THE MAIN

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.411
INPUT FOR CALIFORNIA FUEL

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:32.448
PRICES IS THE COST OF UNREFINED

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.584
PETROLEUM. HOWEVER, AS DIRECTOR

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:36.752
MILDER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:39.021
PETROLEUM MARKET OVERSIGHT, OR

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.624
DPMO, MADE CLEAR AT A HEARING

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.826
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE MYSTERY

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:46.329
GASOLINE SURCHARGE IS UNRELATED

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:47.630
TO CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.699
REQUIREMENTS, BUT INSTEAD

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.134
LIKELY RELATED TO CONCENTRATION

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.935
OF MARKET POWER WITHIN THE

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.770
REFINING SECTOR. SO AS WE

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:56.606
CONSIDER HOW TO ENSURE A

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:57.874
TRANSITION TO A ZERO EMISSION

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.575
TRANSPORTATION FUTURE, I THINK

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:01.644
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:04.180
KEEPING OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.882
MAJOR DRIVERS OF FUEL COSTS FOR

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.851
CALIFORNIANS. WHILE THE STATE

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:09.619
REMAINS COMMITTED TO THESE

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:11.888
CLIMATE GOALS, IT IS CLEAR THAT

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:15.291
A STABLE AND FAIR FUELS MARKET

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.760
IS NEEDED DURING THE TRANSITION

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:19.795
TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, AND THE

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:22.064
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD CAN

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:23.566
HELP WITH THAT TRANSITION BY

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:24.934
ENCOURAGING THE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:27.436
PROLIFERATION OF CLEANER FUELS.

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:30.773
NEXT SLIDE. THIS SLIDE SHOWS

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.608
HOW WE EXPECT THE

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:34.210
TRANSPORTATION MIX TO EVOLVE

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:35.811
OVER TIME. OUR CURRENT

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.647
TRANSPORTATION MIX SYSTEM

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.749
RELIES HEAVILY ON FOSSIL FUELS,

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:41.651
BUT EVEN WITH A RAPID

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.219
TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:44.854
VEHICLES, GIVEN THE USEFUL LIFE

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.856
OF VEHICLES AND THE FACT THAT

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.457
CLEAN VEHICLE REGULATORY

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:50.526
REQUIREMENTS PHASE IN OVER TIME,

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:52.228
WE KNOW THAT CONVENTIONAL

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.796
INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLES

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:55.097
WILL REMAIN ON THE ROAD FOR

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:56.999
SOME TIME, AND SOME EQUIPMENT

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:59.869
TYPES ARE ONLY NOW IN THE

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:02.104
INITIAL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.640
OF ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY AND

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.242
WILL REQUIRE LIQUID FUELS FOR

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:08.077
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SO YOU

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:09.845
SEE ON THE RIGHT OF THE CHART

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.681
THAT WE DON'T EXPECT TO

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.716
COMPLETELY REPLACE OUR FOSSIL

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.418
FUEL USE WITH JUST

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:16.018
ELECTRIFICATION AND HYDROGEN.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.221
WE KNOW THERE WILL BE CONTINUED

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.956
NEED FOR LIQUID FUELS IN THE

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:22.758
FUTURE, AND EVEN IN THE NEAR

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.060
TERM, THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:25.394
FOR IN-STATE PRODUCTION OF

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:26.629
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL TO

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.031
FREE UP CAPACITY TO PRODUCE

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:30.900
TRADITIONAL GASOLINE TO MEET

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:34.170
CURRENT DEMAND. NEXT SLIDE.

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:37.039
ANALYSIS FROM THE STATE'S 2022

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.207
SCOPING PLAN SHOW THAT

01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:39.542
ALTOGETHER, THESE EFFORTS WILL

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:42.311
REDUCE AIR POLLUTION ASSOCIATED

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:43.846
WITH FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION BY

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:46.816
71% COMPARED TO 2020, AND THAT

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:51.053
WILL HELP PUBLIC HEALTH. NEXT

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.656
SLIDE. MUCH OF THE BENEFITS WE

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:54.890
ARE DISCUSSING COME FROM THE

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:56.492
REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR FOSSIL

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.594
FUELS USED IN CARS AND TRUCKS,

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.863
BUT WE ALSO EXPECT THAT AS

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.965
DEMAND FOR FOSSIL FUELS

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:03.766
DECLINES AND CHANGES, THAT THE

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.068
SUPPLY SYSTEM WILL ALSO SHIFT

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:08.804
AND CHANGE. EVEN WITH CUTS IN

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.973
GASOLINE AND DIESEL DEMAND,

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.009
ONGOING DEMAND IS EXPECTED FROM

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:13.909
OTHER SECTORS, INCLUDING

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:16.712
AVIATION FUEL, OCEAN GOING

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:19.282
VESSELS, OFF ROAD FUEL, FUEL

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:21.217
EXPORTS, HYDROGEN GENERATION

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:25.655
AND REFINING. CO-PRODUCTS. NEXT

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:28.391
SLIDE. FINALLY, I KNOW THERE

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:29.158
HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.027
IN OUR AT BIRTH REGULATION, SO

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.562
I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON IT BRIEFLY

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.131
BEFORE HANDING THE MIC OVER TO

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.600
VICE CHAIR GUNDA CARB'S 2020.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.002
AT BIRTH, REGULATION IS

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.903
DESIGNED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:42.838
FROM OCEAN GOING VESSELS WHILE

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:43.973
THEY ARE DOCKED AT CALIFORNIA

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.244
PORTS. THE 2020 AMENDMENTS

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:50.813
BUILD ON A 2007 REGULATION THAT

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.649
ACHIEVED AN 80% REDUCTION IN

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:54.850
CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:57.086
FROM CRUISE SHIPS, CONTAINER

01:05:57.153 --> 01:06:00.089
SHIPS AND REEFER TANKER VESSELS.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:03.125
THE 2020 UPDATED REGULATION

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:05.594
WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1ST OF

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:08.130
2025 AT THE PORTS OF LOS

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:10.499
ANGELES AND LONG BEACH, AND

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:13.402
TANKER VISITS AND FUEL IMPORT

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:14.804
VOLUMES REMAIN UNAFFECTED.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:17.406
TANKER EMISSION REDUCTION

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:18.841
REQUIREMENTS WILL EXTEND

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:21.777
STATEWIDE JANUARY 1ST, 2027.

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.713
YOU WILL NOTE THAT THERE WAS A

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:25.848
FIVE YEAR LAG BETWEEN THE FIRST

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.917
COMPLIANCE DATE AND A SECOND

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:29.852
YEAR LAG FOR THE SECOND

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:36.459
COMPLIANCE DATE. THAT. LAG WAS

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:39.128
INTENDED TO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:41.397
THESE ARE COMPLEX VESSELS THAT

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:44.734
WILL REQUIRE COMPLEX EMISSIONS

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.003
REDUCTION STRATEGIES, AND THE

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.305
NUMBER OF EMISSIONS CAPTURE

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.973
SYSTEMS ON THE MARKET TO

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.376
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.811
VESSELS IS INCREASING IN PARTLY

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:57.847
AS A RESULT OF CARB'S PROCESSED

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:00.583
TO APPROVE AND DEPLOY SYSTEMS.

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:01.851
CURRENTLY, SIX APPROVED

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:04.053
EMISSIONS CAPTURE SYSTEMS ARE

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.154
ACTIVELY BEING USED FOR

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:08.224
COMPLIANCE. TECHNOLOGY

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:08.724
PROVIDERS ARE EXPANDING

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.826
TREATMENT CAPACITY TO CONTROL

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:13.562
MORE AUXILIARY ENGINES PER

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:14.964
VESSEL AND TO CONTROL BOILER

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:18.567
EMISSIONS. CARB CANNOT AND DOES

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.936
NOT TURN TANKER VESSELS AWAY.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:23.072
WE ARE MONITORING THE SIX

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:24.840
PETROLEUM INDUSTRY REPORTS,

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:27.209
INCLUDING THE WEEKLY FUELS

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:29.779
WATCH REPORT ON REFINERY STOCK

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:31.514
SINCE IMPLEMENTATION FOR

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.016
TANKERS BEGAN, VISITS AND FUEL

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.551
IMPORT VOLUMES REMAIN

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:39.422
UNAFFECTED. I WILL NOTE THERE

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:41.457
IS EXISTING LITIGATION ON THE

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:42.992
AT BIRTH RULE, AND WE ARE

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:45.394
CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:46.128
PARTIES TO THAT LITIGATION

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:49.465
ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ISSUES

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:52.034
AROUND AT BIRTH. SO THAT IS THE

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:54.537
STATUS OF OUR CURRENT WORK TO

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:57.106
ACHIEVE OUR LEGISLATIVE AIR

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:59.508
QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS. AND

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.043
NOW I WILL TURN THE MIC OVER TO

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:03.746
VICE CHAIR GUNDA. THANK YOU.

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.748
CHAIR RANDOLPH. GOOD AFTERNOON.

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.149
CHAIRS OF THE COMMITTEES AND

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:09.318
THE MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:10.219
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. I'M

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.854
WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:12.655
COMMISSION, AND I'M GOING TO GO

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:15.591
OVER SOME OF THE IMPACTS TO THE

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:18.127
MARKET AND HOW BEST TO

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.995
STABILIZE THE MARKET. NEXT

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:34.877
SLIDE PLEASE. SO AS THE SLIDES

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.812
ARE BEING PULLED UP, I THINK

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.948
MOST OF YOU HAVE THE PRINTOUTS.

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.749
THE FIRST FEW SLIDES ARE REALLY

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.051
RECOGNIZING SOME OF THE OPENING

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:44.019
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE

01:08:44.086 --> 01:08:46.288
CHAIRS OF THE COMMITTEE. IT IS,

01:08:46.355 --> 01:08:48.624
AS YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST PLOT

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:51.193
THAT MIGHT BE IN FRONT OF YOU.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.528
THERE ARE TWO LINES ON THE PLOT.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.697
SHOULD I JUST WAIT JUST FOR A

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:58.767
SECOND? OKAY, ON THE FIRST

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:00.936
SLIDE, WE HAVE TWO, TWO, TWO

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:02.771
LINES ON IT, AND THE FIRST ONE

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:06.642
THAT SHOWS IN PINK IS THE

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.844
GASOLINE DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA.

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:11.614
IF WE LOOK ALL THE WAY BACK TO

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.517
A DECADE AGO, THE PEAK OF

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:17.286
CALIFORNIA'S DEMAND OCCURRED

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:19.622
AROUND 2007, 2008. AND AS IT

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:22.858
WAS GROWING UP, YOU HAD THE

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:23.726
2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS. AND THEN

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:26.195
YOU SEE A DIP IN DEMAND. BUT IN

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:28.497
THE RECENT TIMES, THE PEAK IN

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.699
CALIFORNIA HAPPENED IN 2017.

01:09:30.766 --> 01:09:32.701
AND SINCE THEN THE DEMAND IN

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.770
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN GOING DOWN.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.705
BUT I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:38.674
GIVEN THAT MANY OF OUR

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:39.875
REFINERIES SUPPORT THE FUEL

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.577
SUPPLY IN NEVADA AND ARIZONA,

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:44.313
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TOTAL

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.548
DEMAND OF GASOLINE COMING OUT

01:09:45.614 --> 01:09:47.449
OF CALIFORNIA REFINERIES

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.718
SUPPORTING THE WESTERN REGION,

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:52.288
THE PEAK HAS HAPPENED IN 2019,

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.756
AND EVEN THAT IS BEGINNING TO

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:57.760
GO DOWN. SO NOW I'M I'M KIND OF

01:09:57.826 --> 01:10:08.537
MOVING FORWARD WITH. YEAH,

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.873
GREAT. AWESOME. SO JUST, YOU

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.309
KNOW, THAT'S THE CHART WE JUST

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.311
SPOKE ABOUT GOING INTO THE NEXT

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:20.182
SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT WHAT THE

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:27.056
NEXT SLIDE SHOWS. I'M GOING TO

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:28.791
KEEP WORKING THROUGH THIS. SO

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:30.893
AS YOU AS YOU WILL SEE IN THE

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.761
NEXT SLIDE. THIS SLIDE IS IS

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.897
LOOKING AT HOW IS THE SUPPLY IN

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:37.132
CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF REFINING

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:38.867
CAPACITY CHANGING OVER TIME.

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:39.768
AND ONE OF THE KEY POINTS THAT

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:42.404
THE CHAIRS HAVE MADE EARLIER IN

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:43.939
THEIR OPENING REMARKS IS THE

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:46.075
SUPPLY OF THE REFINING CAPACITY

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:48.677
IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING DOWN

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.613
FASTER THAN THE DEMAND FOR THE

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:52.615
FUELS THAT WE SUPPLY IN THE

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:56.752
WEST. SO NEXT SLIDE. SO

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:58.887
FURTHERMORE, AS WE THINK ABOUT

01:10:58.954 --> 01:10:59.922
THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, AND

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.057
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE UPSTREAM

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:03.626
CRUDE OIL AND JUST REMINDING

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:04.927
EVERYBODY THAT, YOU KNOW, WE

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.996
HAVE CRUDE OIL COMING INTO THE

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:07.596
REFINERIES THAT THEN CONVERTS

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:08.664
INTO REFINED FUELS. IN

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:11.000
CALIFORNIA, THE UPSTREAM CRUDE

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:13.969
OIL IN CALIFORNIA, COMING FROM

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:15.504
CALIFORNIA, HAS ALSO BEEN

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:16.939
DECLINING AT MUCH FASTER RATE

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:20.442
THAN THE DEMAND. SO AS WE LOOK

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:21.577
ABOUT THOSE THREE THINGS GOING

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.546
TO THE NEXT SLIDE. AS WE PULL

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.348
ALL OF THOSE THREE THINGS

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.816
TOGETHER, ONE OF THE

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.551
CONSEQUENCES THAT WE BEGIN TO

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:32.855
SEE ON THE SYSTEM IS THE PRICE

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.023
SPIKES, SOMETHING THAT THE

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.824
LEGISLATURE HAS SPENT A LOT OF

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.259
TIME THINKING THROUGH HOW BEST

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.894
TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS. BUT

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.196
THAT MISMATCH OF IN-STATE

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:42.731
DEMAND AND THE IN-STATE

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.900
REFINING CAPACITY AND IN-STATE

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.670
CRUDE OIL ARE ALL CONNECTED TO

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.972
THE TO THE PRICE AT THE PUMP

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.140
AND HAVE DIRECT CONSEQUENCES.

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.775
AND I JUST WANT TO NOTE AND

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.143
THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:55.944
MANY TOOLS THAT WERE GIVEN TO

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:56.979
THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AND I

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:57.913
ALSO WANT TO UPLIFT THAT.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.748
YOU'VE ASKED US TO REALLY THINK

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.617
ABOUT PRUDENT USAGE OF THOSE

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:02.785
TOOLS AND PUT A LOT OF

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:04.853
GUARDRAILS ON HOW BEST TO USE

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.788
THEM. TO DATE, THE ENERGY

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:08.791
COMMISSION HAS FUNDAMENTALLY

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.659
FOCUSED ON TRANSPARENCY AND

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:12.361
GETTING MORE DATA TO UNDERSTAND

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:14.863
THE INDUSTRY BEFORE WE DEPLOY

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.665
ADDITIONAL REGULATORY TOOLS.

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:19.601
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NEXT SLIDE

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:22.838
PLEASE. OKAY. SO NOW KIND OF

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.039
BRINGING DOWN TO WHAT'S

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.774
HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.610
DEMAND AND THE SUPPLY OF

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:29.978
REFINING CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:32.047
LET'S LET ME JUST KIND OF SET

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:34.750
YOU UP ON THIS. THE BOTTOM IN

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.351
GREEN ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:38.721
REFINERIES. SO EACH BAR IS THE

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.789
CAPACITY OF EACH OF THOSE

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.658
REFINERIES. THE ONES IN BLUE

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.860
ARE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:46.161
WHAT YOU HAVE ON THE TOP ARE

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.663
THOSE THAT HAVE EITHER

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.865
CONVERTED AWAY FROM REFINING

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:51.834
FUEL OR HAVE INDICATED CLOSURES.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.669
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.504
VERY EVIDENT FROM THE CHART IS

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:56.905
THE GAP BETWEEN THE DEMAND AND

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:59.007
IN-STATE REFINING CAPACITY, AND

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:01.677
WHAT YOU SEE IN SHADED YELLOW

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.112
BETWEEN THE OVERALL DEMAND AND

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:04.980
THE REFINING CAPACITY IS OUR

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:05.714
DEPENDANCE ON IMPORTS. TODAY,

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:08.617
WE GET ABOUT 10 TO 20% OF OUR

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.686
DEMAND BEING MET BY IMPORTS,

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:13.322
DEPENDING ON THE MONTH OF THE

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:14.823
YEAR. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD, ONE

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.259
OF THE CRITICAL THINGS THAT WE

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.827
ALL HAVE TO FOCUS ON IS WE'LL

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.863
HAVE A LOT MORE DEPENDENCY ON

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.498
IMPORTS, REGARDLESS OF WHAT

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:23.766
REFINING CAPACITY STAYS IN

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:26.735
CALIFORNIA. AND AS WE AS DOCTOR

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:28.771
GRUBERT MENTIONED EARLIER AND

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:30.606
THE CHAIRS OF THE COMMITTEE

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.174
COMMENTED, ONE OF THE IMPACTS

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:33.842
THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.011
AS THESE REFINERIES GO DOWN, IT

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:39.148
NOT ONLY IMPACTS THE SUPPLY AND

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.983
POTENTIALLY THE THE PRICES AT

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:42.818
THE PUMP, IT ALSO IMPACTS LOCAL

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:44.853
COMMUNITIES, LABOR AND SUCH.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.854
AND THINKING ABOUT A HOLISTIC

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:47.856
PLAN IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.658
AFTER THE VALERO'S ANNOUNCEMENT

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:52.327
IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, THE

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:53.796
GOVERNOR SENT THE ENERGY

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.764
COMMISSION A LETTER REALLY

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:57.499
ASKING US TO REDOUBLE OUR

01:13:57.566 --> 01:14:00.035
EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:00.803
CLEAR TRANSITION PLAN AND

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:02.371
STABILIZATION OF THE INDUSTRY.

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:04.439
AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:06.442
SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:07.042
THAT LETTER THAT WE SENT BACK

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.278
TO THE GOVERNOR. NEXT SLIDE

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:13.749
PLEASE. SO AS WE STARTED

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.951
WORKING THROUGH THE RESPONSE TO

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:18.353
THE GOVERNOR, ONE OF THE FIRST

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.055
THINGS WE WANTED TO DO IS

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:20.656
CONTINUE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:22.758
THE TRANSPARENCY TOOLS THAT THE

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:24.092
LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED US.

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.627
AND I WANT TO THANK HERE THE

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:27.296
INDUSTRY FOR CONTINUING TO

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.697
COLLABORATE WITH US TO PROVIDE

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.699
CRITICAL INFORMATION TO US

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:31.867
CONFIDENTIALLY, OF COURSE, BUT

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.268
CONTINUING TO ADVANCE THE

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:34.770
CONVERSATION TO DEVELOP MORE

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:36.572
TRANSPARENCY OF THE INDUSTRY AS

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:39.041
A WHOLE. SECOND, THERE HAS BEEN

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.976
A CROSS-AGENCY TASK FORCE THAT

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:42.878
HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.646
SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND GARCIA

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:47.683
FROM EPA AND CNRA, AND WE HAVE

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:49.751
BEEN MEETING SINCE FEBRUARY OF

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.653
THIS YEAR TO REALLY SILO THE

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.821
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:54.890
ENTIRE STATE APPARATUS. AND ONE

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.658
OF THE CRITICAL PARTS OF OUR

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:58.227
CONVERSATION WAS GETTING THEIR

01:14:58.293 --> 01:14:59.761
INPUT INTO DEVELOPING THE

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.530
LETTER. AND FINALLY, WE

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.665
MENTIONED THIS. IN THE PAST, WE

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.534
HAD ROUNDTABLES WITH ALL THE

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:08.070
IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:08.937
STAKEHOLDERS, AND I JUST WANT

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:11.640
TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK ALL

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.742
THOSE MEMBERS WHO'VE SAT WITH

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:14.610
US IN THOSE ROUNDTABLES,

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:16.945
SOMETIMES TEN HOURS AT A TIME,

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:17.779
AND REALLY PROVIDING

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:20.749
INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:22.651
OVERALL AND HOLISTIC IMPACT OF

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.620
THE TRANSITION AND HOW BEST TO

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.722
DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS. ONE OF

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:27.789
THE PIECES THAT I'LL SHOW YOU

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.825
IN THE LETTER THAT WE'VE PUT

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:32.194
FORWARD IS REALLY FROM THE

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:32.828
ENERGY COMMISSION'S PERSPECTIVE

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:33.896
AND FROM OUR OFFICE'S

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:35.864
PERSPECTIVE, ONE OF THE MOST

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:38.200
IMPORTANT THING FOR US WAS TO

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:38.867
FAITHFULLY REPRESENT THOSE

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:39.768
DISCUSSIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.770
WE PROVIDE A HOLISTIC VIEW TO

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.639
YOU AS YOU CONTINUE YOUR

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.707
DELIBERATIONS ON WHAT WAS SAID

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:47.776
IN THE ROOM, AND WHAT ARE SOME

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:48.777
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:51.246
CAME OUT IN THE ROOM? NEXT

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:54.182
SLIDE PLEASE. SO BEFORE WE GO

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.584
INTO THE RECOMMENDATIONS PRETTY

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:58.720
QUICKLY, YOU KNOW, THE THE KIND

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:01.089
OF CONVERSATION OF PRICES AT

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:02.891
THE PUMP, YOU KNOW, KIND OF

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.159
EXTENDED INTO THE ENTIRE

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:05.928
ECOSYSTEM. THERE ARE SEVERAL

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:07.529
PARTS OF THE ECOSYSTEM. AND I

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:08.897
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE JUST

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.832
TAKE A MINUTE TO THINK THIS

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.801
THROUGH, BECAUSE OFTENTIMES

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:14.770
THERE IS A CONFUSION OF THE

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:17.039
CONVERSATION HERE. THERE IS AN

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:18.674
UPSTREAM ELEMENT. SO WE'RE

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.842
TALKING ABOUT CRUDE OIL

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:21.710
PRODUCTION. AND THEN IT COMES

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:24.880
DOWN TO THE REFINERIES AND THE

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:25.747
REFINERIES. YOU KNOW, WHETHER

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:26.748
USE CALIFORNIA CRUDE OR

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:28.850
IMPORTED CRUDE. AND THEN THERE

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:30.619
IS A PASSAGE OF THE REFINED

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:32.654
FUEL INTO THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:36.658
CURRENTLY, WE IMPORT OVER 65%,

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:40.729
CLOSE TO 75% OF OUR FUEL OF OUR

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.598
CRUDE OIL FROM ELSEWHERE. SO

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:45.901
THAT'S JUST WANT TO MAKE MAKE

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:48.003
SURE I NOTE THAT 75%, ROUGHLY

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.704
75% OF OUR CRUDE OIL

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.139
CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA COMES

01:16:51.206 --> 01:16:52.574
FROM OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.876
AS WE MOVE DOWN THE CHAIN, MUCH

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.845
OF THAT IS CONVERTED TO REFINED

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:59.881
FUELS. AND ABOUT 80 TO 90% OF

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.184
REFINED FUELS IN CALIFORNIA

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:02.784
COME FROM CALIFORNIA. BUT WE

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:05.887
STILL DEPEND ON 2010 TO 20% OF

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:07.823
IMPORTS ON REFINED FUEL AS WELL.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.891
SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:12.127
TWO DISTINCTIONS. AND FINALLY,

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:13.829
AS WE MOVE DOWN THE VALUE CHAIN,

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:15.163
THERE IS THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.732
WE'VE HAD AROUND CONSUMER

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.867
PROTECTION ON HOW THE PRICE AT

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:21.803
THE PUMP GETS MADE. NEXT SLIDE

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:26.742
PLEASE. SO JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.910
THAT WE DIG INTO FURTHER ON THE

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:31.213
CRUDE OIL. AND AGAIN AS, AS WE

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:33.215
SHOWED IN THE PREVIOUS OVERALL

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:34.583
PICTURE, THERE ARE SEVERAL

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:36.752
PARTS OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:38.653
THAT ARE CRITICAL IN THE SENSE

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.356
THAT THEY'RE BRITTLE. SO YOU

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:43.625
CANNOT SAY TO SOME PARTS OF

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:44.693
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU CANNOT

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.561
BRING IT DOWN TO 10%

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.697
CONSUMPTION OR 20% USAGE, AND

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:50.332
THEY EITHER ARE THERE OR NOT

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:51.800
THERE. SO THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:53.635
PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM IS WE

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:55.037
NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHICH PARTS

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.438
OF THAT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.073
HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED IN ORDER

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.975
TO HAVE A STABLE SUPPLY AT THE

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.743
PUMP. SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THE

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:04.012
CRUDE OIL, AND I JUST WANT TO

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:05.647
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:07.716
CRUDE OIL, WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.851
LOOKING AT 1989 OR SO, WHEN WE

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:13.088
HAD THE HIGHEST CRUDE OIL USAGE

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:15.557
IN CALIFORNIA, TO NOW THE

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:18.193
OVERALL DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.695
HAS GONE DOWN 28%. WHILE THAT

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.931
HAPPENED, OUR RELIANCE ON

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:25.233
CALIFORNIA CRUDE HAS DROPPED BY

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.569
65%. AND THE REST OF US, THE

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:28.837
REST OF IT BEING MADE THROUGH

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:31.206
IMPORTS OF CRUDE OIL. THE

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:33.608
IMPACT OF THIS CHART IS, GIVEN

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:35.010
THAT MUCH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:37.179
THAT CONNECTS US FROM THE WELLS

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.181
ALL THE WAY TO THE REFINERIES

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.882
AND DOWNSTREAM, THOSE PIPELINES

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:43.051
THAT CONNECT CRUDE OIL TO THE

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.820
REFINERIES ARE NOW APPROACHING

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:47.656
CRITICAL LOW LEVELS. AND THAT

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:49.024
MEANS SOME OF THOSE OPERATORS

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:52.327
FOR EITHER BUSINESS CASE OR

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.196
SAFETY OR RELIABILITY COULD

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:55.764
SHUT DOWN. AND THAT DIRECTLY

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:57.999
MAKES US RECOGNIZE THE

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.801
IMPORTANCE OF STABILIZING THE

01:18:59.868 --> 01:19:01.803
CRUDE OIL VOLUME TO THEN

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.339
STABILIZE THOSE PIPELINE

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:07.843
SYSTEMS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:09.544
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS JUST PUT IN

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:11.079
THERE FOR YOUR RECORD. AND WE

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.981
CAN TALK ABOUT THIS IN Q&amp;A IF

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.716
YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. BUT

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.518
YOU KNOW AT A AT A TOP LEVEL

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.053
WANT TO JUST RECOGNIZE THAT

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:18.854
THERE ARE THREE SYSTEMS,

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.523
PIPELINE SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOW

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.825
THAT WE RELY ON. ONE GOES FROM

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:25.527
CENTRAL VALLEY TO SAN FRANCISCO

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.596
AREA WHERE WE HAVE REFINERIES.

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:29.898
CENTRAL VALLEY TO LOS ANGELES

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:31.066
AND CENTRAL COAST TO LOS

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.767
ANGELES. THOSE ARE THE THREE

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:33.902
PIPELINE SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:35.637
TALKING ABOUT. AND BECAUSE OF

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:37.706
ECONOMIC AND PHYSICAL VOLUMES

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:39.040
THAT THEY CAN CARRY, THERE'S

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.610
TWO THINGS HAPPENING. ONE, THEY

01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:42.811
EITHER NEED TO SHUT THEM DOWN

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:45.080
OR IF IT'S A COMMON CARRIER,

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:47.716
THEY WILL HAVE TO GO TO CPUC TO

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:49.718
GET AN INCREASE IN THE RATES

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:50.852
THAT THEY CAN CHARGE FOR

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:53.355
TRANSPORT OF THAT VOLUME. SO IN

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:54.890
EITHER CASE, WE WILL HAVE THIS

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:57.058
TROUBLE OF THAT COST BEING

01:19:57.125 --> 01:20:00.295
PASSED ON TO THE PUMP. NEXT

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:02.664
SLIDE PLEASE. SO AGAIN, THANKS

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.966
TO PROFESSOR GRUBERT WHO SPOKE

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:07.169
AT THE TOP. I REALLY WANT TO

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.703
COMMEND HER AND THANK HER

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:10.172
SCHOLARLY WORK FOR HELPING US

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.040
FRAME THIS CONVERSATION WHEN WE

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.208
TAKE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.709
WE'VE JUST PRESENTED TO YOU.

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:16.678
CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:19.347
SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS IN CLIMATE

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:20.582
TARGETS AND HEALTH TARGETS, AND

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:23.118
THAT IS EVIDENT FROM THE CHART

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:24.085
THAT WE SHOWED YOU EARLIER,

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.087
WHICH IS BENDING THE DEMAND WE

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.889
HAVE. WE HAVE HIT MATURITY, AND

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.691
THE DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:30.825
FOSSIL FUELS IS GOING TO

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.928
CONTINUE TO GO DOWN. AND AS YOU

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:35.096
THINK ABOUT THAT TRANSITION,

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:37.499
WHAT WE CALL IN SCHOLARLY WORK,

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.701
AGAIN, TO DOCTOR GRUBER'S WORK,

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.736
THIS IS CALLED THE TRANSITION.

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.138
THE TRANSITION IS BASICALLY

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:45.740
WHEN YOU HAVE THE LEGACY SYSTEM,

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:48.843
WHILE DECLINING, HAS STILL A

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.313
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE MARKET

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:52.681
TO BE SERVING. SO WE HAVE

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:55.617
DEMAND IN PETROLEUM GOING DOWN,

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.686
BUT IT'S STILL VERY SIGNIFICANT.

01:20:57.752 --> 01:20:59.888
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE THE

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:02.424
NEW EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, THE

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:03.024
CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.693
ARE COMING UP BUT HAVE NOT

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:06.761
ACHIEVED FULL SCALE. SO WHAT

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.964
WHAT THIS TRANSITION REQUIRES

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.766
IS THREE THINGS. ONE, CONTINUED

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:13.335
INVESTMENTS IN THE LEGACY

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:14.970
SYSTEM, ENSURING THAT THE

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.938
MARKET HAS CONFIDENCE TO INVEST

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:19.574
IN THAT LEGACY SYSTEM. TWO WE

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:20.875
DOUBLE DOWN OUR EFFORTS TO

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:23.311
CONTINUE TO PUT MONEY AND

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.246
EFFORT TOWARDS SCALING THE

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:27.215
EMERGING SYSTEM. AND THREE, A

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:28.683
PROACTIVE PLANNING TO MAKE SURE

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.785
THAT THIS CRISIS DOES NOT

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.120
IMPACT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:33.655
AND VULNERABLE AND WORKERS. AND

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.790
SO ALL THOSE THREE THINGS HAVE

01:21:35.857 --> 01:21:38.627
TO BE DONE NOW SO THAT WE DON'T

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:40.195
CONTINUE TO REACT TO THIS IN

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.764
CRISIS. NEXT SLIDE. SO THIS IS

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.233
MY LAST SLIDE. AND I JUST WANT

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.003
TO MAKE SURE I THANK THE

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:48.970
ROUNDTABLE MEMBERS FOR THEIR

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.039
INCREDIBLE HARD WORK ON MAKING

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:52.741
SURE WE PUT THESE

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.409
RECOMMENDATIONS IN FRONT OF THE

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:56.611
GOVERNOR. SO WE PUT OUR

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:58.013
SOLUTIONS IN THREE BUCKETS. AND

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.648
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:01.716
THREE BUCKETS ARE NOT OR

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.585
BUCKETS THERE AND BUCKETS. AND

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:05.587
WE AGREED THAT ALL THESE

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:06.955
CONVERSATIONS, THE INTERESTS

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:09.591
THAT ARE LAID OUT HERE, ARE

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:12.327
INTERESTS THAT REALLY ARE FROM

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.262
THE DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS WE

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:16.865
HAVE. INDUSTRY HAS A LOT OF

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:19.467
INPUT ON MAKING SURE THE

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.169
INDUSTRY INVESTMENTS ARE

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:22.737
STABILIZED. WE, AS STATE

01:22:22.804 --> 01:22:24.906
AGENCIES HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.741
IN MAKING SURE THE SUPPLY AND

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:28.710
THE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED.

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.812
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE LONG

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:32.647
TERM TRANSITION IS DONE. SO

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:33.915
JUST TO KIND OF GIVE A QUICK

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:35.784
CHECK ON THIS ON BUCKET NUMBER

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:38.753
ONE IS ABOUT GIVEN THAT VALERO

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.555
HAS GIVEN NOTICE, AND I WANT TO

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:44.092
JUST NOTE THAT IF VALERO WERE

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:46.528
TO CLOSE NEXT YEAR IN APRIL, AS

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:48.897
THEY'VE INDICATED, WE WILL HAVE

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:49.698
ONLY TWO REFINERIES IN THE

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.900
NORTH AND AND THAT WILL REDUCE

01:22:51.966 --> 01:22:53.601
THE RESILIENCY IN THE NORTH.

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:55.770
AGAIN, AS THESE RETIREMENTS

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.939
HAPPEN, THE MARKET WILL SOLVE

01:22:58.006 --> 01:22:59.741
FOR ITSELF. AND WE ARE SEEING

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.009
THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.944
THAT. BUT WHILE THE MARKET

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:03.812
TRIES TO SOLVE IT IN THE SHORT

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:05.914
TERM, WE WILL HAVE THOSE

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.048
TRANSITION PERIODS WHERE THE

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:08.183
MARKET IS STILL TRYING TO

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:09.884
FIGURE OUT, AND THAT'S WHERE WE

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:11.653
ARE MOST EXPOSED. AND IT'S

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.587
IMPORTANT FOR US TO PROACTIVELY

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.089
WHETHER VALERO CHOOSES TO

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.957
CONTINUE TO OPERATE OR NOT,

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:17.792
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.195
SURE THAT THE LONG TERM

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.062
TRANSITION TO A SIGNIFICANT

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:22.797
PART OF OUR FUEL COMING FROM

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.532
IMPORTS IS BOTTLENECKED

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:26.201
ACTIVELY AND PROACTIVELY.

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.002
THAT'S ONE Ã. AND THEN GOING

01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:30.271
INTO THE SECOND ONE, WE'RE

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:30.672
CONTINUING TO HAVE

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:31.573
CONVERSATIONS WITH VALERO, AND

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:32.207
THEY'RE CONFIDENTIAL IN NATURE.

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.843
SO I'M GOING TO HOLD THAT HERE

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.711
IN SECOND. BUCKET IS PRIMARILY

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.279
FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THE

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:41.049
INDUSTRY ENTIRE VALUE CHAIN

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:43.251
FEELS CONFIDENCE TO CONTINUE

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:44.552
THEIR INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:46.588
THIS IS THE FOSSIL

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:48.523
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT REQUIRES A

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:49.691
STABILIZATION OF CRUDE OIL. AND

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.860
THE REASONS BEHIND IT THAT I

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.395
MENTIONED A FEW MINUTES AGO.

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:54.929
AND A COLLEAGUE, DIRECTOR LUCAS,

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:57.198
WILL TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:58.767
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. SECOND,

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.935
WE NEED TO HARMONIZE SOME OF

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:03.071
THE STATE REGULATORY TOOLS WITH

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:05.874
THE TRANSITION. AND AS CHAIR

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.709
RANDOLPH MENTIONED, CARB IS

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:08.877
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE TOOLS

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:11.613
THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR HANDS.

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:12.647
AND FROM KETK'S PERSPECTIVE,

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.015
ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT THE

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:14.816
INDUSTRY HAS TALKED ABOUT AS

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.618
ONE OF THE MOST DESTABILIZING

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.286
FOR THEM FROM AN INVESTOR

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.054
CONFIDENCE POINT OF VIEW, IS

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:22.791
THE PENALTY CAP, THE MARGIN CAP.

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:24.058
WE ARE WORKING WITH THE

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:25.894
INDUSTRY. WE HAVE A BUSINESS

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.830

FOR A MARGIN, MARGIN CAP PAUSE

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.875
AND THE LENGTH OF THE PAUSE.

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:43.244
AND AND THE EXACT CONTEXT OF

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.712
THE PAUSE ARE CONTINUING TO BE

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:45.980
DEBATED RIGHT NOW. AND WE

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:48.683
EXPECT THE STAFF TO BRING IT UP.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:51.085
AND FOR A VOTE ON THE 29TH AND

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:53.755
THE THIRD FOR A LOCAL DISTRICTS,

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:55.056
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART THAT

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.558
THERE IS A DISCREPANCY

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.726
SOMETIMES BETWEEN A DISTRICTS,

01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:00.528
IN A LOCAL AGENCIES, IN A

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.730
REGIONAL AGENCIES AND STATE

01:25:02.797 --> 01:25:04.365
AGENCIES, AND IN ORDER TO

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:06.634

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:09.904
CONVERSATIONS WITH DISTRICTS

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:12.340
AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES TO

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:14.209
FORM INFORMAL WORKING GROUPS TO

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.044
MAKE SURE WE ARE ALIGNED AS WE

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:17.812
MOVE FORWARD IN THIS TRANSITION.

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:19.581
AND FINALLY, I WANT TO JUST

01:25:19.647 --> 01:25:21.816
MAKE SURE I UPLIFT THE THE

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:23.117
BUCKET THREE. THAT'S WHAT WE

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:25.453
CALL THEM. THE LAST SECTION,

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.222
THE HOLISTIC TRANSITION. IT IS

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:28.523
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.258
FAITHFULLY REPRESENT THE

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:31.893
CONVERSATIONS IN THE ROOM THAT

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.194
WE'VE HAD, THAT THESE ARE

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:35.363
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LABOR AND

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:37.332
COMMUNITIES. AS PROFESSOR

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:39.067
GRUBERT MENTIONED, WHEN

01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:40.568
INDUSTRIES, FOSSIL INDUSTRIES

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.704
WE'VE SEEN IN COAL AND OTHER

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:44.839
PLACES IN THE WORLD, WHEN THEY

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.074
SHUT DOWN, THE IMPACTS ARE

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.175
QUICKLY PASSED TO THE

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:49.377
COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S IMPORTANT

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:50.678
FOR US TO ACTIVELY THINK ABOUT

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:52.013
WHAT ARE THE MEASURES WE ARE

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.182
GOING TO TAKE TO ENSURE WE

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:55.683
PROTECT THEM. THESE HAVE MANY

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:56.885
RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR LETTER.

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:59.587
BUT, YOU KNOW, THREE KEY POINTS.

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:00.855
IT'S AROUND FUNDING THE

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.857
TRANSITION AND MAKING SURE THE

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:04.959
COMMUNITIES AND THE WORKER

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:06.761
TRANSITION CONTINUES TO HAPPEN.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.863
SECOND, IN TERMS OF LIABILITY,

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:11.833
WHAT DO WE DO. YOU KNOW, AS

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.668
PROFESSOR GRUBERT MENTIONED, AS

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:15.837
THE REFINERIES LEAVE, TO THE

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:16.905
EXTENT THAT THERE IS LIABILITY

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:18.773
THAT'S GOING TO BE PASSED ON TO

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.909
THE COMMUNITIES, YOU KNOW, HOW

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:21.643
DO WE ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:23.711
REGULATORY FORUMS TO ALLOW FOR

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:24.946
THAT TO NOT FALL ON THEM? AND

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.614
FINALLY, THE HEALTH AND SAFETY.

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.716
SO I'M HERE TO ANSWER MORE

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:29.951
QUESTIONS WHEN IT'S WHEN WE'RE

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.486
READY. BUT WITH THAT I'LL PASS

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.721
IT TO DIRECTOR LUCCHESI. GOOD

WE HOST CAL GEM, THE STATE'S

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:48.536
OIL AND GAS REGULATOR. NEXT. OR

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:50.772
OUR FIRST SLIDE? IT WOULD HAVE

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:53.141
BEEN THE NEXT SLIDE AFTER VICE

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:56.411

IS TAKING A COMPREHENSIVE

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:02.984
APPROACH TO STABILIZING THE

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.486
PETROLEUM MARKET SYSTEM IN THIS

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.388
TRANSITION PERIOD, BUILDING ON

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:08.623
THE CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:10.358
PROTECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:11.926
GOALS AND POLICIES ESTABLISHED

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:14.729
BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE CENTRAL

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:16.731
OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:18.766
TO RETURN CALIFORNIA CRUDE

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:21.636
PRODUCTION TO 125 MILLION

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:24.038
BARRELS A YEAR. STABILIZATION

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:26.040
TARGET. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OUR

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:27.742
INTRASTATE PIPELINE SYSTEM AND

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.177
ENSURE A MORE RELIABLE DOMESTIC

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:31.679
CRUDE SUPPLY FOR OUR REFINERIES

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.448
AGAIN DURING THIS TRANSITION

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:35.183
PHASE. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:37.318
FOUR COMPONENTS. IT CODIFIES

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:40.088
OUR REGULATIONS BANNING WELL

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:40.788
STIMULATION TREATMENTS. ALSO

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:42.624
KNOWN AS HYDRAULIC FRACTURING.

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:45.159
IT PROTECTS THE KERN COUNTY

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:45.893
PERMITTING ORDINANCE AND

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.762

LITIGATION RISK SO IT CAN BE

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:51.799
IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY. IT

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:53.968
CREATES A NARROW, TEMPORARY

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:56.270
CEQA EXEMPTION FOR NEW DRILL

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:57.772
PERMITS IN EXISTING OIL FIELDS,

01:27:57.839 --> 01:28:00.041
PAIRED WITH A TWO FOR ONE PLUG

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.743
AND ABANDONMENT FRAMEWORK THAT

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:03.811
CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO SEAL

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:05.279
WELLS IN NEIGHBORHOODS. AND

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.648
FINALLY, IT STRENGTHENS AND

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:49.016
HIS TEAM AROUND THIS EXTREMELY

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.818
CRITICAL AND COMPLEX TRANSITION

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.620
PHASE OF OUR ENERGY TRANSITION.

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:53.954
AND WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.556
OVER TO YOU, CHAIR

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:57.691
PETRIE-NORRIS OR TO THE MAYOR.

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:58.926
THANK YOU. DIRECTOR. THANK YOU

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:01.695
TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WHO

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:02.930
HAVE JOINED US THUS FAR. I

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:05.032
THINK WE WILL GO AHEAD AND HEAR

01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:07.835
FROM MAYOR YOUNG AND THEN WE'LL

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:09.136
OPEN IT UP FOR MEMBER QUESTIONS.

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:11.105
WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:12.273
HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:14.708
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THIS IS

01:35:14.775 --> 01:35:16.844
A FRAUGHT TIME FOR OUR STATE AS

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:19.580
WE CONTEMPLATE LIFE WITH LESS

01:35:19.647 --> 01:35:21.782
OIL REFINERIES AND GASOLINE,

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:23.084
AND THE CHALLENGE OF HOW TO

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:25.119
TRANSITION TO A CLEANER FUTURE

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:27.188
WITHOUT SADDLING THE PEOPLE OF

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:27.788
CALIFORNIA WITH SIGNIFICANTLY

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:29.757
HIGHER GAS PRICES. I'M THE

01:35:29.824 --> 01:35:32.626
MAYOR OF BENICIA, A COMMUNITY

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:34.895
OF 27,000 PEOPLE ON THE SHORES

01:35:34.962 --> 01:35:36.897
OF THE CARQUINEZ STRAIT IN

01:35:36.964 --> 01:35:38.732
SOUTHERN SOLANO COUNTY. WITH

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:40.701
THE EXCEPTION OF CHAIR WILSON,

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:43.704
WHO'S OUR REPRESENTATIVE, YOU

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:45.639
MAY NOT KNOW THAT BENICIA WAS,

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:48.175
IN 1853 THE STATE CAPITOL

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:50.878
BEFORE IT MOVED TO SACRAMENTO.

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:55.249
WE ARE ALSO THE HOME OF VALERO,

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:57.918
AND VALERO IS OUR BIGGEST

01:35:57.985 --> 01:36:00.988
EMPLOYER, OUR BIGGEST TAXPAYER.

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:02.823
AND ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T PAY ANY

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.625
SALES TAX BECAUSE THEY ARE A

01:36:04.692 --> 01:36:06.760
WHOLESALE OPERATION, THEY DO

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:08.729
PAY PROPERTY TAX AND UTILITY

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:10.931
USER TAX AND THEY BUY OVER HALF

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:14.668
OF OUR WATER THAT THEY USE IN

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:17.571
THEIR PROCESSING OPERATION. THE

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:23.043
CLOSURE THAT IS SEEMS, SEEMS

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:25.746
CERTAIN WILL RESULT IN LOSSES

01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:28.716
TO THE CITY DIRECTLY OF ABOUT

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:30.651
10 TO $12 MILLION A YEAR. AND

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:33.587
WE ARE NOT A BIG CITY WHERE WE

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:35.289
CAN EASILY ABSORB THAT KIND OF

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:38.759
A HIT. WE HAVE ENGAGED AN

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.728
ECONOMICS FIRM TO TO FINE TUNE

01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:43.831
THAT NUMBER, AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:36:43.898 --> 01:36:46.233
HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE ACCURATE

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.102
INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:49.570
COMMUNITY SHORTLY. WE WERE

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:52.273
SURPRISED, AS ANYONE, BY THE

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:54.308
ANNOUNCEMENT BY VALERO IN APRIL

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.876
THAT THEY WOULD BE CLOSING IN

01:36:55.943 --> 01:37:00.548
APRIL OF 26, AFTER A DAY OF

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:05.085
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:06.620
REALITY OF THE SITUATION, THE

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:07.788
COUNCIL TOOK AN IMMEDIATE

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:10.558
ACTION TO CREATE FOUR DIFFERENT

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:13.827
TASK FORCES TO LOOK AT THE

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:15.095
IMPACTS OF THE CLOSURE ON THE

01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:17.865
COMMUNITY. ONE OF THEM WAS TO

01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:19.767
LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:20.668
SURROUNDING BUSINESSES IN THE

01:37:20.734 --> 01:37:24.171
INDUSTRIAL PARK. THERE ARE A

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:25.606
NUMBER OF BUSINESSES FOR WHOM

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:28.542
VALERO IS THEIR ONLY CUSTOMER,

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:30.678
SO WHEN VALERO CLOSES, THEY ARE

01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:31.946
LIKELY TO EITHER CLOSE OR

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:33.514
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:37.184
SCRAMBLE TO FIND NEW CUSTOMERS.

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:39.653
THERE'S ALSO THE IMPACT.

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:41.222
ANOTHER TASK FORCE LOOKED AT

01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:44.325
THE IMPACT ON SECONDARY

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:46.360
BENEFICIARIES, IF YOU WILL,

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:49.129
RESTAURANTS, HOTELS AND ALSO

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.898
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:54.768
SPORTS TEAMS AND OTHERS WHO ARE

01:37:54.835 --> 01:37:56.937
RECIPIENTS OF VALERO

01:37:57.004 --> 01:38:00.174
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR VARIOUS

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:02.843
COMMUNITY EVENTS. AND FINALLY,

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:03.911
WE WANTED TO LOOK AT WHAT IS

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:06.247
THE FUTURE OR WHAT COULD BE THE

01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:07.948
FUTURE OF THE 900 ACRES THAT

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:10.651
THEY OWN. BECAUSE WHEN THEY

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.920
LEAVE, WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:18.125
TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE FOR

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:22.830
MOVING FORWARD. AND THERE ARE

01:38:22.896 --> 01:38:24.765
LOTS OF LOCATIONAL ADVANTAGES

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:27.067
THAT BENICIA HAS. IT'S ON THE

01:38:27.134 --> 01:38:29.036
PORT. WE HAVE A PORT, WE HAVE

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:31.805
RAIL. THERE ARE TWO FREEWAYS

01:38:31.872 --> 01:38:33.607
THAT INTERSECT US. AND AGAIN,

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:35.809
WE HAVE THESE 900 ACRES THAT

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:38.312
VALERO OWNS, AS WELL AS

01:38:38.379 --> 01:38:39.713
ADDITIONAL SPACE IN OUR

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:42.750
INDUSTRIAL PARK. THE PREFERENCE,

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:44.018
MY PREFERENCE, THE PREFERENCE

01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:45.586
OF THE CITY, WOULD BE THAT

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:47.121
VALERO WOULD BE ABLE TO STAY

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:49.523
OPEN FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:51.659
TIME BEYOND APRIL 2ND YEARS,

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:53.894
THREE YEARS, FIVE YEARS. AND

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:56.330
THAT'S FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:57.898
ONE IS, FRANKLY, THE THE TRY TO

01:38:57.965 --> 01:38:59.767
PUT OFF THE ECONOMIC HIT THAT

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:02.303
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE. WE KNOW

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:04.204
THAT DISMANTLING ALL THE

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:05.773
EQUIPMENT IS GOING TO TAKE

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:08.108
SEVERAL YEARS. REMEDIATION OF

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:10.544
THE SITE WILL TAKE MANY, MANY

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:11.779
MORE YEARS THAN THAT. WE'RE

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:14.048
PROBABLY LOOKING AT A MINIMUM

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:16.216
OF 5 OR 10 YEARS BEFORE WE WILL

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:17.618
HAVE PRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT

01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:19.887
HAPPENING, WHERE WE COULD START

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:21.789
SEEING SOME KIND OF REVENUE TO

01:39:21.855 --> 01:39:24.692
REPLACE WHAT HAS THAT, WHAT WE

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:31.298
WILL LOSE FROM THEIR CLOSURE.

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:32.800
WE ARE AWARE OF THE

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:34.134
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ENERGY

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:35.703
COMMISSION, AND I WANT TO THANK

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:38.005
VICE CHAIR GUNDA FOR INCLUDING

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:39.573
OUR CITY MANAGER, MR. GIULIANI,

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.842
ON THAT TEAM. AND HE HAS BEEN

01:39:41.909 --> 01:39:43.110
COMING UP HERE REGULARLY TO

01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:45.813
MEET WITH THEM. AND A LOT OF

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:48.549
THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME

01:39:48.615 --> 01:39:50.651
OUT AT THE END OF JUNE FROM THE

01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:51.952
COMMISSION, I BELIEVE, ARE

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:53.654
SENSIBLE AND RATIONAL, GIVEN

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:56.090
THE EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE THAT

01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:57.725
WE FACE IN TRYING TO BALANCE

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.927
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS THAT

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:02.396
WE HAVE MADE WITH MAINTAINING

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:04.732
ENOUGH GAS SUPPLY, THAT WE

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:06.934
DON'T HAVE EXORBITANT PRICE

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.068
INCREASES THAT ARE GOING TO HIT

01:40:08.135 --> 01:40:11.171
LOW INCOME PEOPLE THE HARDEST.

01:40:11.238 --> 01:40:11.972
BUT THERE'S ONE RECOMMENDATION

01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:14.074
IN THAT SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:16.577
THAT IS SEEMS INEVITABLE, BUT

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:18.679
IS ALSO SORT OF A WORST CASE

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:21.382
SCENARIO FOR BENICIA. AND THAT

01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:25.619
IS THE IDEA THAT A LARGE OR THE

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:27.988
IDEA THAT REFINED GASOLINE

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:29.757
WOULD NEED TO BE IMPORTED FROM

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:31.658
ELSEWHERE AND THEN STORED

01:40:31.725 --> 01:40:33.761
BEFORE BEING REINTRODUCED BACK

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:35.662
INTO THE DOMESTIC MARKET,

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:37.698
BECAUSE WE HAVE A DEEP WATER

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:41.735
PORT AND EXISTING STORAGE TANKS,

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:43.036
IT SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT WE'RE

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:46.106
GOING TO BE TARGETED AS ONE OF

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:49.977
THOSE PLACES WHERE WE BECOME A

01:40:50.043 --> 01:40:52.679
TERMINAL, AND THAT, FROM OUR

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:55.682
PERSPECTIVE, IS A LOSE LOSE,

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:59.987
LOSE SCENARIO. THERE IS NO JOBS

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:01.622
THAT COME WITH THIS. THERE ARE

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:04.024
NO TAXES THAT COME WITH THIS.

01:41:04.091 --> 01:41:05.025
THERE WILL BE CONTINUED

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:07.127
EMISSIONS FROM THOSE TANKS THAT

01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:08.929
WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED. AND

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:10.164
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE WILL NOT

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:13.033
BE ABLE TO PLAN FOR REPLACEMENT

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.002
OF THAT SITE, PLAN FOR

01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:16.770
REDEVELOPMENT OF THAT SITE AS

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:19.740
LONG AS THAT'S THERE. OUR PORT,

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:21.108
WHICH CERTAINLY SERVES VALERO

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:22.976
NOW, AND THEY BRING IN ALL

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:26.747
THEIR OIL BY TANKER. IT IS OLD.

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:28.715
IT'S NOT ELECTRIFIED. SO I WAS

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.651
INTERESTED IN WHAT CHAIR

01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:31.952
RANDOLPH SAID ABOUT THE

01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:34.021
POSSIBILITY OF PERHAPS

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:36.089
UPGRADING THE PORTS, BECAUSE

01:41:36.156 --> 01:41:37.758
RIGHT NOW THESE TANKERS COME IN

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:39.927
AND THEY SPEW THEY HAVE TO THEY

01:41:39.993 --> 01:41:41.695
CAN'T TURN OFF. SO THEY SPEW

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:43.697
DIESEL INTO THE AIR

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:45.032
CONTINUOUSLY WHILE THEY ARE IN

01:41:45.098 --> 01:41:48.001
PORT. SO IF WE COULD ELECTRIFY

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:51.271
THE PORT, THAT WOULD BE A BIG

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:52.039
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO THE

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:55.642
COMMUNITY. IF IT'S GOING TO BE

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:59.246
OUR FATE THAT WE WOULD BECOME A

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:00.714
GAS TERMINAL, THEN I THINK

01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:03.517
THERE SHOULD BE SOME WAY TO

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:04.718
COMPENSATE THE CITY FOR THE

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.854
SEVERE AND SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.922
MONEY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:42:08.989 --> 01:42:10.824
EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THAT

01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:13.560
DECISION. AND THE MOST

01:42:13.627 --> 01:42:14.795
FRUSTRATING PART OF ALL OF THIS,

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.697
FOR ME, IS THAT THESE DECISIONS

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:19.132
ARE BEING MADE IN THE

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:19.967
BOARDROOMS IN SAN ANTONIO AND

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:21.735
HERE IN SACRAMENTO, AND WE'RE

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:24.872
NOT AT THE TABLE. WE HAVE NO

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:25.606
INFLUENCE OVER WHAT'S GOING TO

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:27.808
HAPPEN. WE ARE SIMPLY WAITING

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:29.910
FOR THE DECISION TO BE MADE AND

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:31.778
FOR OUR FATE TO BE REVEALED TO

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:34.915
US WHEN IT COMES TO THIS, LIKE

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:38.218
THE STATE, WE SHARE THE VALUE

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:40.087
OF INVESTING OUR RESOURCES AND

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:43.056
ENERGY IN POLICIES TO ENSURE A

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:44.691
HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. AND WE

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:45.692
TAKE SERIOUSLY OUR

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:47.861
RESPONSIBILITY AS CIVIC LEADERS

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:49.162
TO THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDER IDEAS

01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:52.900
AND ACTIONS THAT PROTECT OUR

01:42:52.966 --> 01:42:54.701
FUTURE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:56.270
YET, IN ORDER FOR THOSE

01:42:56.336 --> 01:42:57.671
ASPIRATIONAL GOALS OF

01:42:57.738 --> 01:42:59.973
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY TO

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.242
SUCCEED, WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:04.044
IT'S ALSO ECONOMICALLY VIABLE

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:05.946
FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:07.548
THAT'S BOTH THE OPPORTUNITY AND

01:43:07.614 --> 01:43:09.783
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE NOW FACE.

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:12.786
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.521
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. I THANK

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:16.123
YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:18.892
SPEAK TODAY, AND I LOOK FORWARD

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:19.793
TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION.

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:23.130
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MAYOR,

01:43:23.196 --> 01:43:24.064

PANELISTS. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:26.833
NOW OPEN IT UP FOR SOME

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:27.801
QUESTIONS AND CONVERSATION FROM

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:30.704
MEMBERS. JUST AS A REMINDER,

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:31.939
BECAUSE THIS IS A THREE

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.941
COMMITTEE HEARING, WE'RE GOING

01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:35.776
TO GO AHEAD AND LIMIT Q&amp;A TO

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:37.411
FIVE MINUTES PER MEMBER. SO

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:39.680
APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE IF I CUT

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:41.515
YOU OFF. WE'LL DO KIND OF A LAP

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:43.116
AND THEN COME BACK AS TIME

01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:44.851
PERMITS. SO, CHAIR WILSON, DID

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:47.654
YOU WANT TO KICK US OFF? YEAH.

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:49.289
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:51.758
THIS. GREAT. THANK YOU. THANK

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:53.927
YOU TO THE PANELISTS. I REALLY

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:55.162
APPRECIATE YOU INCLUDING ONE OF

01:43:55.228 --> 01:43:57.965
MY MAYORS, MAYOR OF BENICIA,

01:43:58.031 --> 01:44:01.101
MAYOR YOUNG. AND SO I WANTED TO

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:03.136
ASK YOU A CLARIFYING QUESTION,

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:04.204
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BENEFICIAL

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.840
FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO HEAR AND

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:09.076
THEN GO ON TO THE PANELIST. ONE

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:10.777
THING THAT YOU DID NOT INCLUDE

01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:14.982
IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS IS THE

01:44:15.048 --> 01:44:16.850
CITY OF BENICIA. AS FAR AS THE

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:17.951
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEIR

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:20.053
COMMITMENT TO A CLEAN

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.788
ENVIRONMENT AND SOME OF THE

01:44:21.855 --> 01:44:22.923
SUCCESSES THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:25.192
HAVE IN RELATED TO MONITORING

01:44:25.258 --> 01:44:26.693
VALERO IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.629
MEMBERS AND MONITORS, AND JUST

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.931
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IN TERMS OF

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:31.698
THE ENVIRONMENT. SO CAN YOU

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.600
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT?

01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:34.835
BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY HAVE THE

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:37.704
ASSUMPTION THAT YOU'RE HERE AND

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:39.272
ADVOCACY OF A PARTICULAR

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:40.841
INDUSTRY, WHICH WOULD BE

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:42.142
INCONSISTENT IN TERMS OF WHERE

01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:44.311
THE COMMUNITY IS. THANK YOU,

01:44:44.378 --> 01:44:45.612
THANK YOU. I HOPE I DON'T COME

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:47.814
ACROSS AS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:49.082
INDUSTRY. I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:52.853
BENICIA, AND CERTAINLY THERE IS

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:54.888
A LARGE CONTINGENT OF PEOPLE IN

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:57.791
BENICIA WHO ARE OF THE OPINION

01:44:57.858 --> 01:44:59.660
THAT THE SOONER IT CLOSES, THE

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:00.894
BETTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:03.196
REASONS. WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:06.033
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AS A

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:07.601
RESULT OF ACCIDENTS AND LEAKS

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:10.003
AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:11.905
HAVE HAPPENED AT THE REFINERY.

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:15.842
AND SO FOR MANY PEOPLE, THE

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:17.544
CLOSURE COULDN'T COME SOON

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:20.847
ENOUGH. IN A MACRO SENSE, I

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:22.616
UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW,

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:25.252
I'M A MAYOR WHO HAS TO BALANCE

01:45:25.318 --> 01:45:27.054
A BUDGET. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.622
THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE

01:45:28.689 --> 01:45:30.657
CLOSURE, THAT'S WHERE THE

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.959
CONFLICT COMES IN BETWEEN MY

01:45:33.026 --> 01:45:35.095
OWN PERSONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:37.230
DESIRES AND THOSE OF SOME OF

01:45:37.297 --> 01:45:38.699
THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:40.600
COMMUNITY. AND YOU MIGHT HEAR

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:41.735
FROM THEM TODAY AND THE NEED TO

01:45:41.802 --> 01:45:43.970
BALANCE THE BUDGET AND COME AND

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:45.706
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COME UP

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:46.873
WITH REVENUE TO REPLACE WHAT

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.809
WILL BE LOST. THANK YOU. AND

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:51.311
WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM COMMUNITY

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:52.045
MEMBERS AS WELL IS WANTED TO

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:53.947
LEAVE, BUT MAYBE NOT YET. AND

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:57.217
IT SPEAKS TO THE TRANSITION.

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:59.720
THIS QUESTION IS FOR VICE CHAIR

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:01.888
GUNDA IN TERMS OF AND WE'VE

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:02.989
HEARD THIS FROM SOME OF OUR

01:46:03.056 --> 01:46:04.658
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY IN

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:06.193
TERMS OF ADDITIONAL DATA TO BE

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:08.562
ABLE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:11.064
END STATE CRUDE PRODUCTION

01:46:11.131 --> 01:46:14.835
NEEDS TO STABILIZE THE GASOLINE

01:46:14.901 --> 01:46:16.536
MARKET. AND MAYBE IT MAYBE IS

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:18.105
BETTER FOR DIRECTOR LÀ CÁC. MY

01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:20.574
APOLOGIES. YOU HAD THE CHART UP

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:23.210
THERE AT THE TOP. WE'RE SOLVING

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:25.979
TO THIS. I BELIEVE IT WAS 125

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:28.582
BARRELS. LET ME GO BACK TO THAT

01:46:28.648 --> 01:46:33.887
SLIDE. AND IS THAT IS I MEAN,

01:46:33.954 --> 01:46:35.155
DO WE FEEL LIKE THAT IS

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:36.790
SUFFICIENT AND IS THERE ANY WAY

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:37.924
TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL IS THERE

01:46:37.991 --> 01:46:39.292
ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL DATA THAT

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:40.761
YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT WOULD HELP

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:42.529
US UNDERSTAND THIS IS HOW WE

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.931
STABILIZE OUR FUEL PRICES AS

01:46:44.998 --> 01:46:47.901
WELL. I THINK VICE CHAIR WILL

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:49.503
START OFF AND THEN HAND IT TO

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:51.371
ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, CHAIR

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:52.606
WILSON. I THINK JUST GOING BACK

01:46:52.672 --> 01:46:54.775
TO THE PIPELINE SYSTEM. SO THE

01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:56.943
NUMBER THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT

01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:57.711
TODAY AGAIN IN TERMS OF

01:46:57.778 --> 01:46:59.679
CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA,

01:46:59.746 --> 01:47:03.784
WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT 500 TO

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:05.986
580 MILLION BARRELS A YEAR. SO

01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:07.788
ABOUT A HALF A BILLION BARRELS

01:47:07.854 --> 01:47:09.055
THAT WE USE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:11.057
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PIPELINE

01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:12.225
SYSTEM, THE THREE ARTERIES THAT

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:13.894
WE SHOWED IN ORDER TO STABILIZE

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.797
THEM TO ABOUT 40% THROUGHPUT SO

01:47:16.863 --> 01:47:18.698
THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO

01:47:18.765 --> 01:47:20.600
OPERATE IN A BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:21.902
SAFETY BUT ALSO WITHOUT RATE

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:22.869
INCREASES ON THE COMMON

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:25.272
CARRIERS. WE THINK OF IT AS

01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:28.375
ABOUT 25 TO 30% OF CRUDE OIL

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:30.310
COMING INTO THOSE PIPELINES.

01:47:30.377 --> 01:47:31.278
AND THAT'S THE VOLUME THAT

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:35.782
COMES TO 125. AND I WILL JUST

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:40.987
ADD THAT. CALCIUM AND THE

01:47:41.054 --> 01:47:42.422
DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:44.758
DON'T REGULATE PRODUCTION. NO

01:47:44.825 --> 01:47:47.060
STATE AGENCY DOES. WE REGULATE

01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:49.763
OIL AND GAS DRILLING WELLS,

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:51.097
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. SO

01:47:51.164 --> 01:47:53.700
WE'RE USING WELL PERMITS AS A

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:55.502
PROXY TO GET TO THAT PRODUCTION

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:58.138
LEVEL WITH THAT KIND OF

01:47:58.205 --> 01:48:03.210
FOUNDATIONAL SETUP. THE NUMBER

01:48:03.276 --> 01:48:05.579
WELLS ARE IT'S VERY VARIABLE

01:48:05.645 --> 01:48:07.814
HOW MUCH A WELL CAN PRODUCE OR

01:48:07.881 --> 01:48:10.617
NOT. THAT'S A FACTOR THAT GOES

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:11.852
INTO THE ASSUMPTIONS IN OUR

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:14.187
PROJECTIONS, ALONG WITH DECLINE

01:48:14.254 --> 01:48:15.622
RATES AND ALSO OPERATOR

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:17.624
DECISIONS. AND SO THAT'S A LONG

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:19.793
WINDED WAY OF SAYING THAT THIS

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.761
IS AN ESTIMATED PROJECTION

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:24.197
BASED ON A VERY OBJECTIVE

01:48:24.264 --> 01:48:25.966
APPROACH TO THE ASSUMPTIONS.

01:48:26.032 --> 01:48:27.734
WITH THAT SAID, IT DOES NOT

01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:29.502
ACCOUNT FOR POTENTIAL

01:48:29.569 --> 01:48:31.972
ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION FROM

01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:33.974
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.944
LEASES AND LANDS, AS WELL AS

01:48:38.011 --> 01:48:38.645
EXISTING CURRENTLY OPERATING

01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:39.813
OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.616
PRODUCTION OFFSHORE. SO DO WE

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:45.118
THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL WITH

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:46.086
THE PROJECTION TARGET THAT

01:48:46.152 --> 01:48:48.688
WE'VE IDENTIFIED WILL HELP,

01:48:48.755 --> 01:48:50.523
WILL STABILIZE PRODUCTION? YES.

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:53.860
OR THE MARKET? YES WE DO. THANK

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:55.629
YOU. AND I'LL ASK MY LAST TWO

01:48:55.695 --> 01:48:56.763
QUESTIONS QUICKLY SO WE CAN

01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:58.765
HOLD AND SET THE EXAMPLE FOR

01:48:58.832 --> 01:48:59.799
OTHERS. AND SO I'LL HAVE THE

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:02.235
PEOPLE ANSWER AND THEN THAT'LL

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:06.172
BE IT. ONE WOULD BE FOR YOU,

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:08.041
NOTED DIRECTOR CASEY ABOUT THE

01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:09.776
WE DON'T REGULATE PROJECT

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:10.977
PRODUCTION. SO MY QUESTION

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:13.146
WOULD BE TO PROFESSOR GRUBERT

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:14.748
IS WHEN YOU'RE IN A

01:49:14.814 --> 01:49:15.815
MID-TRANSITION, WOULD THAT BE

01:49:15.882 --> 01:49:16.983
AN APPROPRIATE THING TO DO IS

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:18.852
TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.553
DOES THAT. AND THEN THE OTHER

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:22.989
ONE IS NOTED TO TERRA RANDOLPH.

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:23.857
YOU YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:25.926
REMARKS THAT COMPANIES HAVE

01:49:25.992 --> 01:49:27.694
COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS TO MEET THE

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:30.897
AT BERTH REGULATION. AND AS I

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:32.332
UNDERSTAND IT, THERE'S REALLY

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:33.733
TWO PATHWAYS, WHICH IS

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.901
ELECTRIFICATION OR, YOU KNOW,

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:36.770
PAY A CARB. FINE. IS THERE ANY

01:49:36.836 --> 01:49:38.605
OUTSIDE OF THAT? ARE THOSE THE

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:41.041
ONLY TWO PATHWAYS TO MEET THE

01:49:41.107 --> 01:49:43.476
TO COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS TO MEET

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:44.778
THE AT BERTH REGULATION? THANK

01:49:44.844 --> 01:49:48.581
YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:49.849
THE QUESTION. I THINK IN

01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:50.917
GENERAL, WHAT OUR RESEARCH

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:52.619
SUGGESTS AND WHAT SOME OF THE

01:49:52.686 --> 01:49:53.753
THEORETICAL BASIS FOR A LOT OF

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.156
THIS WORK SUGGESTS, IS THAT YOU

01:49:56.222 --> 01:49:57.023
DO NEED SOME CENTRALIZED

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:57.657
COORDINATION HERE. A LOT OF THE

01:49:57.724 --> 01:49:59.859
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

01:49:59.926 --> 01:50:01.027
DOES LOOK AT THAT AS HAPPENING

01:50:01.094 --> 01:50:02.595
THROUGH SOME KIND OF PUBLIC

01:50:02.662 --> 01:50:03.697
OWNERSHIP OR PUBLIC MANAGEMENT,

01:50:03.763 --> 01:50:05.465
WHETHER THAT'S AT A FEDERAL

01:50:05.532 --> 01:50:05.999
LEVEL OR STATE LEVEL OR A

01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:07.767
SUBLEVEL. BUT YES, I THINK IN

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:08.902
THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:10.704
ACTUALLY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO

01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:11.905
HAVE AN EFFECTIVE MANAGED

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:12.939
TRANSITION, THINKING PRETTY

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:14.874
CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:16.576
SUPPLY AND DEMAND YOU NEED AND

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:18.712
NEED TO GUARANTEE, AND HOW YOU

01:50:18.778 --> 01:50:20.447
MANAGE THAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:21.681
IMPORTANT. OIL IS A LITTLE BIT

01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:22.949
DIFFERENT FROM COAL, BUT I WILL

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:25.018
SAY ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT

01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:25.785
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A LOT

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:27.721
IN THE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE,

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:29.222
JUST IN TERMS OF HOW YOU MIGHT

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:29.923
THINK ABOUT MANAGING FUEL

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:32.625
SUPPLY, IS, IN THE CASE OF COAL

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:34.728
IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE

01:50:34.794 --> 01:50:35.328
POTENTIALLY SOME OPPORTUNITIES

01:50:35.395 --> 01:50:36.963
TO, FOR EXAMPLE, STOCKPILE A

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.765
FUEL UP UNTIL THE POINT WHERE

01:50:38.832 --> 01:50:40.834
YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO KIND OF RIDE

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.502
YOU OUT FOR THE NUMBER OF YEARS

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:43.770
THAT YOU THINK YOU STILL NEED

01:50:43.837 --> 01:50:45.205
IT. THERE ARE PROBABLY ALSO

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:45.872
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH OIL,

01:50:45.939 --> 01:50:48.274
ALTHOUGH AGAIN, LESS CLEAR THAT

01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:50.744
IT'S CAPABLE OF ACTUALLY KIND

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.879
OF DISASSOCIATING THE TIMING OF

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:54.948
SUPPLY AND THE TIMING OF DEMAND.

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:56.049
BUT SOMETHING WHERE YOU ARE

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:57.817
VERY, VERY CLEAR ABOUT HOW MUCH

01:50:57.884 --> 01:50:59.319
PRODUCTION YOU ACTUALLY NEED

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:00.520
AND WHEN, AND SETTING VERY

01:51:00.587 --> 01:51:02.122
CLEAR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHEN

01:51:02.188 --> 01:51:03.757
THAT'S GOING TO STOP, I THINK,

01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:05.291
IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:06.159
BENEFICIAL FROM A THEORETICAL

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:08.495
AND EXAMPLE PERSPECTIVE. THANK

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:12.866
YOU. OKAY. THE REGULATION DOES

01:51:12.932 --> 01:51:17.070
NOT REQUIRE A SPECIFIC

01:51:17.137 --> 01:51:17.904
TECHNOLOGICAL PATHWAY. RATHER

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:21.007
IT REQUIRES THE COMPANIES TO

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:23.977
REDUCE EMISSIONS. SHORE POWER

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:26.379
BEING ONE OF THE THE COMMON

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:29.682
STRATEGIES. AND ONE OF THE

01:51:29.749 --> 01:51:30.884
REASONS WHY THERE'S THAT FIVE

01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:33.219
YEAR AND SEVEN YEAR LAG, AS I

01:51:33.286 --> 01:51:35.321
MENTIONED, IS TO ALLOW THE

01:51:35.388 --> 01:51:37.223
COMPANIES TO DEVELOP THEIR

01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:39.626
STRATEGIES. SO A LOT OF THE

01:51:39.692 --> 01:51:41.961
COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON THESE

01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:43.797
CAPTURE SYSTEMS THAT I

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:45.698
MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS

01:51:45.765 --> 01:51:48.802
THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OF APPROVE

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.537
EACH SYSTEM THAT'S PROPOSED,

01:51:50.603 --> 01:51:52.238
AND WE HAVE APPROVED SIX OF

01:51:52.305 --> 01:51:54.941
THEM, AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO

01:51:55.008 --> 01:51:58.578
WORK ON THOSE STRATEGIES. THE

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:00.747
OTHER COMPLIANCE OPTION IS WHAT

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:02.816
WE CALL THE REMEDIATION FUND.

01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:04.617
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:07.087
IT'S NOT A FINE, BECAUSE A FINE

01:52:07.153 --> 01:52:08.254
WOULD WOULD IMPLY THAT THE

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:09.823
COMPANIES ARE SOMEHOW NOT IN

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:11.825
COMPLIANCE. INSTEAD, THE

01:52:11.891 --> 01:52:14.060
REMEDIATION FUND IS FUNDS THAT

01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:17.597
BASICALLY SAY THE COMPANY IS

01:52:17.664 --> 01:52:18.965
NOT REDUCING THE EMISSIONS

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:20.934
THEMSELVES, BUT INSTEAD ARE

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.969
PROVIDING FUNDS TO THE LOCAL

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:24.237
AIR DISTRICTS AND THE AIR

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:26.606
DISTRICTS. TAKE THOSE FUNDS AND

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:28.942
USE OTHER EMISSIONS STRATEGIES

01:52:29.008 --> 01:52:31.978
TO REDUCE THE OVERALL EMISSIONS

01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:34.814
THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:39.452
COMPANIES. SO THOSE ARE THE THE

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:42.856
COMPLIANCE PATHS. LET ME ASK A

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.824
HOPEFULLY QUICK FOLLOW UP

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:46.693
QUESTION REGARDING SOME OF THE

01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:49.662
THIS THE DEMAND PROJECTIONS IN

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:53.666
THE VARIOUS SLIDES. SO CHAIR

01:52:53.733 --> 01:52:54.901
RANDOLPH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:56.603
SLIDE THIS IS. I THINK IT WOULD

01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:58.104
HAVE BEEN 13 BUT IT'S NOT

01:52:58.171 --> 01:52:59.706
NUMBERED. THIS IS YOUR

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:01.107
PROJECTED TRANSPORTATION FUEL

01:53:01.174 --> 01:53:04.811
MIX SLIDE. SO IT BOTH SHOWS THE

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:08.748
THE FUEL MIX CHANGING FAIRLY

01:53:08.815 --> 01:53:09.949
DRAMATICALLY. BUT IT ALSO SHOWS

01:53:10.016 --> 01:53:13.820
A QUITE DRAMATIC OVERALL DEMAND

01:53:13.887 --> 01:53:16.656
REDUCTION, WHICH I'M PUZZLED BY

01:53:16.723 --> 01:53:18.892
HOW STEEP THAT IS. CAN YOU HELP

01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:20.160
ME HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:53:20.226 --> 01:53:22.529
RIGHT. SO THAT IS THE DEMAND

01:53:22.595 --> 01:53:25.265
REDUCTION THAT BASICALLY IS

01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:27.867
REFLECTED. IF ALL OF THE

01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:29.669
STRATEGIES IN THE SCOPING PLAN

01:53:29.736 --> 01:53:33.606
ARE IMPLEMENTED AS PLANNED,

01:53:33.673 --> 01:53:37.310
WHICH MEANS, FOR INSTANCE, THAT

01:53:37.377 --> 01:53:39.712
AS UNCERTAINTIES ARISE AND AS

01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:42.215
DELAYS ARISE, THAT DEMAND WILL

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:46.553
NOT MOVE AS QUICKLY DOWN AS AS

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:49.756
INDICATED ON THAT CHART. AND

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:52.859
THE SCOPING PLAN DOES INCLUDE A

01:53:52.926 --> 01:53:55.128
WHOLE SECTION ABOUT POTENTIAL

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:56.262
UNCERTAINTIES. AND

01:53:56.329 --> 01:53:57.997
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'VE SEEN SOME

01:53:58.064 --> 01:53:59.799
OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES ARISE.

01:53:59.866 --> 01:54:01.834
WE HAVE SEEN THE ATTACKS FROM

01:54:01.901 --> 01:54:03.970
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE

01:54:04.037 --> 01:54:07.740
SEEN EFFORTS TO STOP THE

01:54:07.807 --> 01:54:09.676
IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RULES. WE

01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:13.580
ARE CURRENTLY IN LITIGATION TO

01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:16.649
TRY TO PREVENT THOSE PAUSES.

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:19.052
BUT BUT THEY ARE REAL. AND I

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:22.589
THINK AS PART OF THIS SORT OF

01:54:22.655 --> 01:54:24.857
MANAGEMENT ISSUE THAT WE'RE ALL

01:54:24.924 --> 01:54:26.559
TALKING ABOUT, WE NEED TO BE

01:54:26.626 --> 01:54:29.963
MINDFUL OF KEEPING AN EYE NOT

01:54:30.029 --> 01:54:32.532
ONLY ON THE PROJECTIONS, BUT ON

01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:34.834
SORT OF HOW THAT DEMAND IS

01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:37.637
ACTUALLY REDUCING IN REAL TIME

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:39.872
OVER TIME. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:54:39.939 --> 01:54:41.541
PART OF THE CONTINUED

01:54:41.608 --> 01:54:44.143
ENGAGEMENT THAT WE AS STATE

01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:45.645
AGENCIES ARE COMMITTED TO,

01:54:45.712 --> 01:54:47.981
BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE

01:54:48.047 --> 01:54:51.651
NEED TO BE ADAPTIVE IN HOW WE

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:53.786
WORK ON THESE TRANSITION ISSUES

01:54:53.853 --> 01:54:56.155
AND RECOGNIZE THAT IF DEMAND IS

01:54:56.222 --> 01:54:59.559
NOT MOVING DOWN AS FAST AS

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:00.827
ANTICIPATED, THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:02.829
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:04.530
THAT AND HOW TO MANAGE THAT.

01:55:04.597 --> 01:55:06.666
AND AGAIN, I MIGHT I THINK I'M

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:08.001
MISSING SOMETHING BECAUSE

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:09.636
EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID WOULD.

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:12.238
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE YELLOW IS

01:55:12.305 --> 01:55:13.840
LIKE ELECTRICITY. SO THAT'S HOW

01:55:13.906 --> 01:55:16.309
QUICKLY WE'RE MOVING PEOPLE

01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:17.543
INTO EVS. BUT YOU'RE NOT

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.846
SHOWING YOU'RE NOT SHOWING LIKE

01:55:19.912 --> 01:55:21.648
A RELATIVELY FLAT OVERALL

01:55:21.714 --> 01:55:23.750
DEMAND WITH A GROWING SHARE OF

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:26.619
EVS. YOU'RE SHOWING THAT LIKE

01:55:26.686 --> 01:55:30.590
DEMAND PERIOD IS GOING DOWN BY

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:33.860
LIKE MORE THAN 50% IN THE NEXT

01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:35.662
20 YEARS AND BY SOMETHING LIKE

01:55:35.728 --> 01:55:37.864
30% IN THE NEXT FIVE. SO THIS

01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:40.967
IS ON ROAD TRANSPORTATION, FUEL

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:44.304
DEMAND. AND SO IT INCLUDES

01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:46.806
THINGS LIKE STRATEGIES AROUND

01:55:46.873 --> 01:55:48.041
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:49.709
THINGS LIKE THAT. SO IT

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:51.711
INCLUDES THE WHOLE SUITE OF

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:53.179
POTENTIAL ON ROAD

01:55:53.246 --> 01:55:54.981
TRANSPORTATION, FUEL DEMAND

01:55:55.048 --> 01:55:55.915
STRATEGIES. AND THE REASON WHY

01:55:55.982 --> 01:55:59.719
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE AND SHARE

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:02.588
THIS CHART IS BECAUSE IT IT

01:56:02.655 --> 01:56:06.125
EVEN IF YOU SORT OF ASSUME A

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:07.627
HIGHER DEMAND, YOU'RE STILL

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:09.295
GOING TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:13.299
CHANGE IN THE FUEL MIX AS

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.501
ELECTRIFICATION CONTINUES, AS

01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:17.203
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:18.037
SUPPORTS ELECTRIFICATION AND

01:56:18.104 --> 01:56:20.973
OTHER TYPES OF FUELS LIKE

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.175
HYDROGEN AND RENEWABLE FUELS.

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:24.644
SO SO THAT'S WHY IT'S SORT OF

01:56:24.711 --> 01:56:27.780
TITLED THE FUEL MIX SLIDE,

01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:28.648
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY KIND OF

01:56:28.715 --> 01:56:30.750
ABOUT HOW THIS FUEL MIX IS

01:56:30.817 --> 01:56:33.119
GOING TO CHANGE. AND EVEN AS

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:35.755
THAT DEMAND CURVE MAY GO DOWN

01:56:35.822 --> 01:56:38.624
AT A SLOWER RATE, THAT MIX IS

01:56:38.691 --> 01:56:40.660
GOING TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE

01:56:40.727 --> 01:56:42.929
OVER TIME. OKAY, SO I AM

01:56:42.995 --> 01:56:43.930
CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:46.933
THE YELLOW IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:47.667
LIKE, THAT'S LITERALLY SUPPOSED

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:49.769
TO BE LIKE EV MILES TRAVELED,

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:51.938
OR THE EQUIVALENT OF EV MILES

01:56:52.004 --> 01:56:54.774
TRAVELED. YEAH, IT'S MEANT TO

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:57.610
EQUAL THE PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:56:57.677 --> 01:56:59.212
OVERALL DEMAND THAT'S BEING MET

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:00.646
BY ELECTRICITY, AS OPPOSED TO

01:57:00.713 --> 01:57:04.584
BY A LIQUID FUEL. OKAY. WOW.

01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:05.885
OKAY. THIS IS QUITE STARTLING.

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:07.854
I THINK WE HAVE TO COME BACK TO

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.856
THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS

01:57:09.922 --> 01:57:11.057
LIKE THE FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT

01:57:11.124 --> 01:57:11.924
WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE FOR. AND

01:57:11.991 --> 01:57:14.694
I DON'T I DON'T THINK ANYONE I

01:57:14.761 --> 01:57:17.463
MEAN, I DON'T THINK ANYONE

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:18.197
BELIEVES THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:57:18.264 --> 01:57:21.367
GOING TO INCREASE OVERALL

01:57:21.434 --> 01:57:24.070
DEMAND FOR SOME MIX OF

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:25.805
TRANSPORTATION FUELS. CLEANER.

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:27.740
OTHERWISE THIS DRAMATICALLY

01:57:27.807 --> 01:57:30.977
OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. AND THE

01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:32.779
OTHER THING THAT I'M CONFUSED

01:57:32.845 --> 01:57:36.215
BY IS THAT THIS CHART, YOUR

01:57:36.282 --> 01:57:38.718
CHART SHOWS THE DEMAND FOR

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:40.119
LIQUID. AGAIN, IF I'M

01:57:40.186 --> 01:57:41.053
UNDERSTANDING THIS CORRECTLY,

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.855
YOUR CHART SHOWS THE DEMAND FOR

01:57:42.922 --> 01:57:45.925
LIQUID PETROLEUM FUEL GOING

01:57:45.992 --> 01:57:49.629
FROM LIKE 2.25 EJ AND THEN

01:57:49.695 --> 01:57:52.298
GOING DOWN WHATEVER THAT IS

01:57:52.365 --> 01:57:56.803
GOING TO 1.125 BY 2030, WHICH

01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:58.404
AGAIN, THAT'S A HUGE REDUCTION.

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:01.107
WHEREAS THE CDC CHART SHOWS

01:58:01.174 --> 01:58:05.812
OVERALL. MONTHLY DEMAND GOING

01:58:05.878 --> 01:58:10.116
DOWN VERY MINIMALLY BETWEEN

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:12.585
2022 AND 2027. SO AGAIN, THIS

01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:13.753
MIGHT BE COMPARING APPLES TO

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.788
ORANGES, BUT IT LOOKS TO ME

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:17.990
LIKE YOU ARE PROJECTING A

01:58:18.057 --> 01:58:19.826
TREMENDOUS, VERY, VERY RAPID

01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:21.627
DECREASE. AND THIS IS NOT

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:23.429
REFLECTING A VERY RAPID

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:25.164
DECREASE AT ALL. IS THAT IS

01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:27.700
THAT CORRECT? YEAH. CHAIR I'M

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:29.969
JUST GOING TO SLIDE NUMBER 26

01:58:30.036 --> 01:58:32.839
ON THE TRANSITION CHART. THAT

01:58:32.905 --> 01:58:35.842
KIND OF GOES TO 2050. SO ON THE

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:37.543
PREVIOUS CHART THAT CHAIR

01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:39.312
RANDOLPH MENTIONED, IT'S YOU

01:58:39.378 --> 01:58:41.247
KNOW GIVEN THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:42.915
ABOUT DIFFERENT FUELS, IT'S

01:58:42.982 --> 01:58:45.117
IT'S PUT IN THE ENERGY CONTEXT

01:58:45.184 --> 01:58:47.220
OF EXAJOULES, BUT IN TERMS OF

01:58:47.286 --> 01:58:48.888
PURE GALLONS OF TRANSPORTATION

01:58:48.955 --> 01:58:51.958
FUEL, WHAT YOU SEE HERE ARE TWO

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:53.659
LINES PROJECTED FORWARD, ONE IN

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:54.894
YELLOW AND ONE IN BLUE. THAT

01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:57.597
GIVES YOU THE RANGE OF FUTURE

01:58:57.663 --> 01:58:59.332
SCENARIOS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:58:59.398 --> 01:59:01.100
CONSIDERING UNDER THE BLUE,

01:59:01.167 --> 01:59:03.236
WHICH IS HIGH ELECTRIFICATION

01:59:03.302 --> 01:59:05.705
STRATEGY. YOU WILL SEE A LOT

01:59:05.771 --> 01:59:07.874
MORE RAPID DECLINE IN THE FUELS.

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:10.009
BUT THE YELLOW IS IS THE MORE,

01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:12.144
YOU KNOW, FORECASTED AS OF

01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:13.880
TODAY, YOU KNOW, FORWARD

01:59:13.946 --> 01:59:16.682
LOOKING AND THAT UNCERTAINTY TO

01:59:16.749 --> 01:59:18.751
CHAIR RANDOLPH'S POINT IS WHAT

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:20.620
WE NEED TO PLAN FOR. BECAUSE

01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:22.021
WHILE WE WANT THE BLUE LINE TO

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:23.589
HAPPEN FOR OUR CARBON

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:25.725
NEUTRALITY GOALS, THE YELLOW IS

01:59:25.791 --> 01:59:26.959
A CONSERVATIVE SCENARIO AND WE

01:59:27.026 --> 01:59:29.962
NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO

01:59:30.029 --> 01:59:30.963
SUPPLY CALIFORNIA NO MATTER

01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:33.132
WHERE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:35.801
THAT. OKAY, SO YOU'RE SAYING

01:59:35.868 --> 01:59:37.570
THAT THE CARB CHART REFLECTS

01:59:37.637 --> 01:59:40.773
THE, I GUESS, KIND OF AMBITIOUS

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:41.774
SCENARIO THAT YOU'RE, WHICH IS

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:43.776
THE BLUE LINE, AND YOU ARE

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:44.977
PLANNING FOR THE BASELINE

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.579
SCENARIO. YEAH. SO THOSE ARE

01:59:46.646 --> 01:59:49.115
THE TWO ONES, THE FORECAST ONES,

01:59:49.181 --> 01:59:49.749
THE CARBON NEUTRALITY PATHWAY.

01:59:49.815 --> 01:59:52.084
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH OF

01:59:52.151 --> 01:59:53.920
THEM TO ENSURE WE MOST LIKELY

01:59:53.986 --> 01:59:55.922
WILL BE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:56.889
AND THINKING ABOUT HOW HOW TO

01:59:56.956 --> 02:00:00.526
ABSORB THAT UNCERTAINTY. OKAY.

02:00:00.593 --> 02:00:02.862
I'M GOING TO LET OTHER FOLKS

02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:03.729
ASK QUESTIONS. I MIGHT COME

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:05.598
BACK TO THIS BECAUSE I THINK

02:00:05.665 --> 02:00:06.933
THAT THERE'S AGAIN, LIKE THIS.

02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:08.701
IT'S ONE THING TO ASSUME A VERY

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.770
AMBITIOUS CHAIR OF ZEVS AND ZEV

02:00:10.836 --> 02:00:12.538
ADOPTION, AND I THINK WE SHOULD

02:00:12.605 --> 02:00:13.906
DO THAT AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES

02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:15.942
TO DO THAT, BUT EXPECTING THAT

02:00:16.008 --> 02:00:17.743
WE ARE JUST GOING TO SOMEHOW

02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:20.680
REDUCE OVERALL DEMAND FOR

02:00:20.746 --> 02:00:22.582
TRANSPORT IN THE STATE THAT

02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:23.950
DRAMATICALLY. I DON'T I DON'T

02:00:24.016 --> 02:00:25.818
THINK IS A REALISTIC ASSUMPTION.

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.553
SO I THINK THAT AS WE THINK

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:28.821
ABOUT OUR LONG TERM TRANSITION

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:31.424
PLAN, LIKE WE'VE GOT TO MAKE

02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:32.024
SURE THAT WE'RE COMING BACK TO

02:00:32.091 --> 02:00:34.293
VERY GROUNDED, I THINK, CORE

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:35.628
ASSUMPTIONS. SO I'LL COME BACK

02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:37.830
ONCE WE GIVE OTHERS AN

02:00:37.897 --> 02:00:40.166
OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS.

02:00:40.232 --> 02:00:44.070
LET ME MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:00:44.136 --> 02:00:48.708
KALRA. THANK. THANK YOU ALL SO

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:50.710
MUCH. AND THANK YOU TO OUR

02:00:50.776 --> 02:00:53.145
CHAIRS FOR ORGANIZING THIS

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:55.881
MEETING. AND, YOU KNOW, AS WAS

02:00:55.948 --> 02:00:57.917
INDICATED, YOU KNOW, THERE'S

02:00:57.984 --> 02:01:00.720
BEEN A 40 YEAR KIND OF DECLINE

02:01:00.786 --> 02:01:03.055
THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

02:01:03.122 --> 02:01:06.459
GLOBAL TRENDS AS WELL AS WHAT

02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:07.226
WE'RE SEEING IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:01:07.293 --> 02:01:09.795
WE KNOW BASED UPON SOME OF THE

02:01:09.862 --> 02:01:11.998
INFORMATION THAT WAS JUST GIVEN

02:01:12.064 --> 02:01:13.599
TO US AND HAS BEEN GIVEN TO US,

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:17.036
THAT THE PRODUCTION HERE IS

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:19.105
PART OF A LARGER GLOBAL MARKET

02:01:19.171 --> 02:01:21.741
AND IS REALLY JUST KIND OF A

02:01:21.807 --> 02:01:24.210
DROP IN THE BUCKET, SO TO SPEAK,

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:25.544
BUT AS INDICATED, DOES HAVE AN

02:01:25.611 --> 02:01:27.313
IMPACT, OF COURSE, PARTICULARLY

02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:29.515
AS IT APPLIES TO JOBS AND WHAT

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:30.750
HAVE YOU. AS TO WHAT'S

02:01:30.816 --> 02:01:33.119
HAPPENING HERE IN THE STATE,

02:01:33.185 --> 02:01:33.886
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I

02:01:33.953 --> 02:01:35.788
WANT TO POSE, AND I'LL POSE

02:01:35.855 --> 02:01:36.889
QUESTIONS THAT CAN EITHER BE

02:01:36.956 --> 02:01:38.524
ANSWERED OR FOLKS IN THE NEXT

02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:41.360
PANEL WANT TO AS WELL. SO IN

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:42.528
THE INTEREST OF TIME, ONE

02:01:42.595 --> 02:01:44.864
QUESTION IS REGARDING THIS KIND

02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:47.633
OF THIS TRANSITION AWAY FROM

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.169
COMBUSTION ENGINES. THE

02:01:50.236 --> 02:01:53.039
PROPOSED NGT DOES NOT ADDRESS,

02:01:53.105 --> 02:01:53.839
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, THE

02:01:53.906 --> 02:01:54.674
ENERGY COMMISSION'S

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:56.175
RECOMMENDATIONS TO RAPIDLY

02:01:56.242 --> 02:01:57.777
DEPLOY INVESTMENTS TO DECREASE

02:01:57.843 --> 02:01:59.879
GASOLINE DEMAND THROUGH VMT

02:01:59.945 --> 02:02:00.913
REDUCTIONS, ZERO EMISSION

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:01.781
VEHICLES AND RELATED

02:02:01.847 --> 02:02:03.849
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WHY DOES THE

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:05.017
PROPOSAL KIND OF IGNORE THE

02:02:05.084 --> 02:02:07.319
DEMAND SIDE SOLUTIONS, WHICH

02:02:07.386 --> 02:02:08.020
INCLUDE OTHER CO-BENEFITS,

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:12.024
INCLUDING JOB CREATION AS WELL?

02:02:12.091 --> 02:02:15.661
YES, I CAN TAKE THAT. I THINK,

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:18.698
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A ROBUST SET

02:02:18.764 --> 02:02:22.301
OF DEMAND REDUCTION STRATEGIES.

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:26.205
AND AND I THINK THIS WORK IS

02:02:26.272 --> 02:02:28.741
REALLY ABOUT THINKING ABOUT HOW

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:30.209
TO STABILIZE THE FUEL PRICES

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:32.878
AND THE FUEL SUPPLY,

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:35.114
RECOGNIZING THAT WE WILL

02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:36.916
CONTINUE TO HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:38.718
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND

02:02:38.784 --> 02:02:41.921
VMT REDUCTION STRATEGIES THAT

02:02:41.987 --> 02:02:45.725
WILL IDEALLY PROVIDE OTHER

02:02:45.791 --> 02:02:48.694
OPTIONS BESIDES JUST GASOLINE

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:52.298
USE. BUT WE DO WANT TO BE

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:53.833
MINDFUL THAT SOMETIMES THE IT

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:56.068
IS SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

02:02:56.135 --> 02:02:57.703
RESIDENTS WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY

02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:59.605
MAKING THE TRANSITION TO THE

02:02:59.672 --> 02:03:02.441
NEWER TECHNOLOGIES, AND WE WANT

02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:04.110
TO MAKE SURE AND BE PROTECTIVE

02:03:04.176 --> 02:03:05.845
OF OF AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:08.147
THAT THEY HAVE WHILE STILL

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:09.982
CONTINUING TO ADVANCE OUR

02:03:10.049 --> 02:03:12.184
PUBLIC HEALTH AND CLIMATE GOALS.

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:14.553
AND SOME OF THAT. AND JUST AS A

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:15.921
COMMENT TO THAT, SOME OF THE

02:03:15.988 --> 02:03:17.823
INFRASTRUCTURE, SOME OF THE

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.692
TRANSITION CAN ALSO ADDRESS

02:03:19.759 --> 02:03:21.260
CALIFORNIANS THAT MAY FIND IT

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:23.028
OUT OF REACH NOW. BUT AGAIN,

02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:23.729
BUILDING OUT THAT

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:24.830
INFRASTRUCTURE AND GIVING

02:03:24.897 --> 02:03:26.232
CREDITS AND WHAT HAVE YOU AS

02:03:26.298 --> 02:03:27.767
PART OF A OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:29.335
DOING THAT I THINK THAT STILL

02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:30.569
HAVEN'T REACHED ENOUGH

02:03:30.636 --> 02:03:31.771
CALIFORNIANS. BUT I DO BELIEVE

02:03:31.837 --> 02:03:33.105
THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY MORE

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:35.074
WORK TO BE DONE THERE. CAN I

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:36.909
JUST ALSO NOTE REALLY QUICKLY,

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:38.844
AS VICE CHAIR MENTIONED, THE

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:40.713
THIRD SORT OF PILLAR, THE THIRD

02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.681
BUCKET REALLY KIND OF CIRCLES

02:03:42.748 --> 02:03:44.950
BACK TO THAT BASIC POINT. THANK

02:03:45.017 --> 02:03:47.186
YOU. AND THEN ALSO THE ENERGY

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:48.487
COMMISSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:49.855
PLANNED AND UNPLANNED

02:03:49.922 --> 02:03:51.657
MAINTENANCE EVENTS DUE TO

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:53.225
SAFETY INCIDENTS HAVE THE MOST

02:03:53.292 --> 02:03:54.660
DIRECT IMPACT ON GAS SUPPLY AND

02:03:54.727 --> 02:03:56.796
PRICES. SO WHAT STEPS WOULD

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:59.098
THIS PROPOSAL TAKE TO PREVENT

02:03:59.165 --> 02:04:00.232
PRICE SPIKES FROM UNPLANNED

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:03.068
MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY IN ORDER

02:04:03.135 --> 02:04:06.172
TO, YOU KNOW, ENSURE THAT WE'RE

02:04:06.238 --> 02:04:06.906
PREVENTING EXPLOSIONS,

02:04:06.972 --> 02:04:09.575
OBVIOUSLY. BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW,

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:11.043
YOU KNOW THAT HARM CONSUMERS,

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:11.911
WORKERS, FRONTLINE COMMUNITY

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:14.980
MEMBERS, OUR CLIMATE BUT ALSO

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:16.615
IN TERMS OF STABILITY. THANK

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:17.983
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO FOR

02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:19.852
THAT ONE, WE RECENTLY LAST

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:21.520
BUSINESS MEETING ABOUT TEN DAYS

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:24.490
AGO FORMALLY OPENED A

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:25.191
RULEMAKING ON WORKING

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:26.592
COLLABORATIVELY ON THE LONG

02:04:26.659 --> 02:04:28.828
TERM WITH THE INDUSTRY AND THE

02:04:28.894 --> 02:04:29.695
STAKEHOLDERS ON THE RESUPPLY

02:04:29.762 --> 02:04:31.764
OBLIGATIONS THAT AB TWO ONE

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.365
PROVIDES US, BUT ALSO THE

02:04:33.432 --> 02:04:34.967
MINIMUM INVENTORY. SO WE ARE

02:04:35.034 --> 02:04:35.801
CONDUCTING OUR ANALYSIS. WE

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:38.204
OPENED A RULEMAKING. WE OPENED

02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:39.505
A INFORMATION PROCEEDING TO

02:04:39.572 --> 02:04:40.873
GATHER INFORMATION. BUT YOU'RE

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:41.907
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. THOSE ARE

02:04:41.974 --> 02:04:43.742
IMPORTANT STRATEGIES THAT WE

02:04:43.809 --> 02:04:46.345
NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST ON.

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:48.280
AND SO THAT THAT PROCEEDING IS

02:04:48.347 --> 02:04:48.881
A FORMAL VENUE FOR THAT. THANK

02:04:48.948 --> 02:04:51.851
YOU. AND TO PIVOT A LITTLE BIT

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:53.152
TO THE CLOSURES, THE CLOSURE

02:04:53.219 --> 02:04:54.687
ANNOUNCEMENT OF PHILLIPS 66

02:04:54.753 --> 02:04:56.522
WORKERS LEFT BEHIND ARE

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:57.823
CERTAINLY FACING EXTREME AND

02:04:57.890 --> 02:05:00.092
UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS, IN

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:01.594
ADDITION TO FUTURE ECONOMIC

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.761
UNCERTAINTY. AND SO DOES THE

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:04.897
STATE HAVE A PLAN FOR HOW TO

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:07.166
HELP THE IMPACTED WORKERS AND

02:05:07.233 --> 02:05:07.933
COMMUNITIES AS REFINERIES CLOSE?

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.902
KIND OF A BROAD QUESTION, BUT

02:05:09.969 --> 02:05:12.304
KIND OF DRAWING FROM THE

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:15.474
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF PHILLIPS 66.

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:18.210
YEAH. SO TO YOUR POINT, I THINK

02:05:18.277 --> 02:05:19.612
ALL THREE QUESTIONS, PART OF

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:21.814
THAT TOUCHES THE BUCKET THREE.

02:05:21.881 --> 02:05:23.582
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:05:23.649 --> 02:05:25.818
US, YOU KNOW, AS AS WE LOOKED

02:05:25.885 --> 02:05:27.286
AT THE LETTER AND TRIED TO

02:05:27.353 --> 02:05:28.687
BEGIN TO WORK ON THAT, SOME OF

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:31.323
THEM ARE CLEARLY WITHIN THE

02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.857
REGULATORY TOOLS THAT THE

02:05:31.924 --> 02:05:32.958
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES CAN

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:33.893
WORK ON. SO WE'RE WORKING ON

02:05:33.959 --> 02:05:35.828
SOME OF THEM. I THINK THERE IS

02:05:35.895 --> 02:05:38.230
A PROPOSAL. I THINK THE

02:05:38.297 --> 02:05:38.898
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE MENTIONED

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:41.000
ABOUT IT BEING A STARTING POINT,

02:05:41.066 --> 02:05:42.134
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE

02:05:42.201 --> 02:05:43.669
TO WORK THROUGH

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:45.137
OPERATIONALIZING ALL THE

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:47.606
RECOMMENDATIONS IN TIME. AND, I

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:48.741
MEAN, JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING,

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:50.476
I KNOW THAT A LOT OF OTHER

02:05:50.542 --> 02:05:52.711
TYPES OF FACILITIES NUCLEAR

02:05:52.778 --> 02:05:54.914
POWER PLANTS, GAS FIRED, WHAT

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:55.748
HAVE YOU FIRED, POWER PLANTS,

02:05:55.814 --> 02:05:57.683
WHAT HAVE YOU ARE REQUIRED TO

02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:59.051
DO SO, BUT OUR CALIFORNIA'S

02:05:59.118 --> 02:05:59.785
REFINERIES ARE REQUIRED TO

02:05:59.852 --> 02:06:00.853
SUBMIT CLOSURE PLANS THAT

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.755
INCLUDE PLANS FOR SAFETY,

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:04.623
COMMISSIONING, DECOMMISSIONING

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:08.594
AND SITE CLEANUP. SO YES, THERE

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:10.763
ARE SOME SOME PLANS. YOU KNOW,

02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:12.665
THE THE THING THAT WE AGAIN, TO

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:13.899
FAITHFULLY REPRESENT THE

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:15.734
DISCUSSIONS IN THE ROUNDTABLES,

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:18.771
IT HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE

02:06:18.837 --> 02:06:19.838
CONVERSATIONS COLLECTIVELY THAT

02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:21.340
THERE COULD BE REGULATORY

02:06:21.407 --> 02:06:22.641
IMPROVEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT

02:06:22.708 --> 02:06:25.811
THESE PLANS ARE DONE MORE

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:26.845
HOLISTICALLY, TO THE POINT THAT

02:06:26.912 --> 02:06:29.048
YOU'RE MAKING ON HOW BEST TO

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:29.782
CLOSE THOSE GAPS THAT MIGHT

02:06:29.848 --> 02:06:30.816
EXIST. YEAH, I AGREE, I THINK

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:32.952
THAT THERE COULD BE MORE. I'M

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.053
GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE'S AN

02:06:34.119 --> 02:06:35.154
AGREEMENT THERE, MORE WORK

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.622
NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE. AND

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:37.890
JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME,

02:06:37.957 --> 02:06:40.259
I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH A MORE

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:42.094
AGAIN, A MORE GENERAL QUESTION.

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:42.761
THE STATE ALREADY HAS A

02:06:42.828 --> 02:06:43.729
REGULATORY PROCESS FOR

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:45.597
APPROVING NEW WELLS ACROSS

02:06:45.664 --> 02:06:46.832
CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT IS THE

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.534
JUSTIFICATION FOR WAIVING THAT

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:49.802
PROCESS ENTIRELY, GIVEN WHAT IS

02:06:49.868 --> 02:06:52.037
POSSIBLY AT STAKE FOR THE

02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:53.038
ENVIRONMENT, COMMUNITIES, AND

02:06:53.105 --> 02:06:55.708
OUR CLIMATE GOALS? THANK YOU

02:06:55.774 --> 02:07:00.646
FOR THE QUESTION. THE PROPOSAL

02:07:00.713 --> 02:07:03.882
IS NOT A FREE PASS TO INDUSTRY

02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:06.752
TO DRILL INDEFINITELY. IT'S A

02:07:06.819 --> 02:07:10.389
VERY TARGETED APPROACH. THAT'S

02:07:10.456 --> 02:07:11.557
TEMPORARY. IT HAS A SUNSET DATE

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:15.327
OF TEN YEARS FROM NOW, AND IT

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:21.066
IT IS AN EXEMPTION. ALL OTHER

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:21.767
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:23.569
INCLUDING LOCAL REGULATIONS,

02:07:23.635 --> 02:07:25.838
CONTINUE TO APPLY. AND CAL GÒM

02:07:25.904 --> 02:07:27.806
WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY. ITS

02:07:27.873 --> 02:07:30.209
ROBUST TECHNICAL REVIEW OF ALL

02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:31.710
NEW WELL DRILLED PERMITS, ALONG

02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:34.313
WITH PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.015
OBLIGATIONS. WE CAL GEM HAS

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:39.818
ALSO, THROUGH ADDITIONAL

02:07:39.885 --> 02:07:41.653
RESOURCES FROM THE LEGISLATURE.

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:43.288
THANK YOU. BUILT A VERY ROBUST

02:07:43.355 --> 02:07:44.923
AND COMPREHENSIVE ENFORCEMENT

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.891
PROGRAM THAT IT WILL CONTINUE

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:48.360
TO HOLD INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE

02:07:48.427 --> 02:07:52.164
DURING THIS TRANSITION. AND I

02:07:52.231 --> 02:07:53.832
WOULD ALSO JUST WANT TO

02:07:53.899 --> 02:07:57.803
EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS

02:07:57.870 --> 02:08:01.306
REALLY FOCUSED AND TARGETED FOR

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:03.308
THIS IMMEDIATE NEED TO

02:08:03.375 --> 02:08:06.111
STABILIZE THE PIPELINE

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:06.779
INFRASTRUCTURE AND STABILIZE

02:08:06.845 --> 02:08:08.680
PRODUCTION. THAT'S THE NEED

02:08:08.747 --> 02:08:10.716
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS,

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:13.752
NOT OPEN UP CALIFORNIA FOR MORE

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:16.188
DRILLING OPPORTUNITIES

02:08:16.255 --> 02:08:18.057
INDEFINITELY. THANK YOU. THANK

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:23.295
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU,

02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:29.601
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURR. THANK YOU

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:31.737
ALL FOR FOR BEING HERE. I

02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:32.871
REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:34.673
TIME OUT OF YOUR VERY BUSY

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:35.774
SCHEDULES. I HAD A COUPLE

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:38.577
QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE SEQUA

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:39.945
EXEMPTION. I MEAN, IF YOU'D

02:08:40.012 --> 02:08:41.880
ASKED ME A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:44.149
WHETHER WE'D BE SEEKING A CEQA

02:08:44.216 --> 02:08:44.750
EXEMPTION FOR OIL DRILLING, I

02:08:44.817 --> 02:08:47.152
WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THAT WOULD

02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:48.654
NEVER HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:51.056
I'VE GOT TO SAY, I'VE GOT

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:52.558
CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. IT'S IT'S

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:55.094
NOT AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THIS

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:56.795
ISN'T STREAMLINING. IT'S NOT

02:08:56.862 --> 02:08:59.064
SPEEDING IT UP. IT'S ACTUALLY

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:01.567
AN OUTRIGHT EXEMPTION. AND SO I

02:09:01.633 --> 02:09:04.403
KNOW IT'S COUPLED WITH THE 2 TO

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:05.971
1. BUT COULD YOU SORT OF COVER

02:09:06.038 --> 02:09:08.073
WHAT WOULD BE TYPICALLY THE

02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:09.074
KINDS OF MITIGATION MEASURES

02:09:09.141 --> 02:09:13.245
THAT OCCUR THAT HAPPEN WHEN

02:09:13.312 --> 02:09:15.681
SEQUA IS APPLIED TO THESE KINDS

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:17.683
OF WELL DRILLING AND SORT OF

02:09:17.749 --> 02:09:19.651
WHAT WE'RE GIVING UP? BECAUSE

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:22.888
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT UNDER SEQUA,

02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:24.756
YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO, YOU

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:27.025
KNOW, YOU'D ANALYZE WHETHER OR

02:09:27.092 --> 02:09:27.759
NOT THERE'S SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS

02:09:27.826 --> 02:09:28.527
TO THE ENVIRONMENT OR

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:29.595
COMMUNITIES. YOU'D ACTUALLY

02:09:29.661 --> 02:09:32.264
HAVE TO MITIGATE TO THE EXTENT

02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:35.000
FEASIBLE OR HAVE OVERRIDING

02:09:35.067 --> 02:09:35.901
CONSIDERATIONS. BUT THERE WOULD

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:37.903
BE A SERIES OF MITIGATION

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:39.304
MEASURES THAT WOULD BE IMPOSED

02:09:39.371 --> 02:09:40.606
TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY. THERE

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:42.941
WOULD BE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:44.910
HAVE PUBLIC PROCESSES TO MAKE

02:09:44.977 --> 02:09:46.612
SURE THAT I THINK THE GOALS OF

02:09:46.678 --> 02:09:47.846
WHAT I THINK YOU'VE STATED EVEN

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:49.848
IN THE LETTER THAT THIS NOT BE

02:09:49.915 --> 02:09:50.749
NEAR HOMES AND SENSITIVE

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:52.818
RECEPTORS. I MEAN, PART OF WHAT

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:54.853
HAPPENS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:55.988
THAT THAT YOU'RE, THAT YOU ARE

02:09:56.054 --> 02:09:56.822
COMPLYING WITH THOSE KINDS OF

02:09:56.889 --> 02:09:58.690
THINGS OR THAT YOU ARE

02:09:58.757 --> 02:10:00.692
COMPLYING WITH THE OTHER STATE

02:10:00.759 --> 02:10:02.761
REQUIREMENTS FOR OIL DRILLING

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:03.896
HAPPENS BECAUSE SEQUA HAPPENS

02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:05.597
AND THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS SORT

02:10:05.664 --> 02:10:06.765
OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING'S

02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:08.333
BEEN MISSED, THEY UNDERSTAND

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:09.968
HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SO

02:10:10.035 --> 02:10:11.236
I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THIS

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:13.071
OUTRIGHT EXEMPTION AND WHAT

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:15.073
THAT REALLY MEANS IN TERMS OF

02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:16.808
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES,

02:10:16.875 --> 02:10:17.576
PROTECTING PUBLIC. SO I WAS

02:10:17.643 --> 02:10:19.044
WONDERING IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY

02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:21.079
GO THROUGH WHAT WHAT ARE THE

02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:21.947
TYPICAL KINDS OF MITIGATION

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:22.848
MEASURES AND PROJECT FEATURES

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:25.751
THAT WOULD OCCUR WHEN CEQA IS

02:10:25.817 --> 02:10:27.519
APPLIED TO OIL DRILLING? AND SO

02:10:27.586 --> 02:10:29.488
WHAT WHAT ARE WE SORT OF GIVING

02:10:29.555 --> 02:10:32.090
UP? THAT IS A REALLY CRITICAL

02:10:32.157 --> 02:10:34.693
QUESTION. THANK YOU. SO THE

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:37.996
PROPOSAL THE TWO FOR ONE IS

02:10:38.063 --> 02:10:39.932
INTENDED TO ADDRESS THROUGH

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:41.600
THOSE CONDITIONS OUTLINED THE

02:10:41.667 --> 02:10:45.637
TYPICAL IMPACTS THAT WOULD

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:49.541
NORMALLY BE SEEN IN A

02:10:49.608 --> 02:10:52.611
ESTABLISHED FIELD. SO REQUIRING

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:55.681
THAT A TAKE PERMIT IS NOT

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:58.450
REQUIRED, THAT A STREAM BED

02:10:58.517 --> 02:11:00.419
ALTERATION PLAN. SO NO IMPACTS

02:11:00.485 --> 02:11:03.155
TO WATERWAYS ARE IMPACTED.

02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:05.290
CULTURAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:07.526
ARE IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION TO

02:11:07.593 --> 02:11:10.495
THAT, THERE IS STILL THE

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:12.664
REQUIREMENT OF CAL GEM AND THE

02:11:12.731 --> 02:11:16.235
WATER BOARDS TO ENSURE THAT

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:18.604
INJECTION WELLS DO NOT IMPACT

02:11:18.670 --> 02:11:20.505
OUR AQUIFERS AND OUR DRINKING

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:21.807
WATER GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES. SO

02:11:21.873 --> 02:11:24.776
THAT IS NOT BEING EXEMPTED

02:11:24.843 --> 02:11:27.312
UNDER SEQUA. THROUGH THIS

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:30.182
PROPOSAL. IN ADDITION, IT KEEPS

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:34.820
IN PLACE EXISTING. EXCUSE ME,

02:11:34.886 --> 02:11:36.288
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS,

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:39.191
MITIGATION MEASURES AND LOCAL

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:40.158
GOVERNMENT REGULATORY

02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:42.894
REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE EXISTING

02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:47.299
FIELDS THAT EXIST NOW. SO IN

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:50.002
TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GIVING UP,

02:11:50.068 --> 02:11:52.537
WE THE INTENT OF THIS IS TO

02:11:52.604 --> 02:11:54.606
REALLY NARROW THE SCOPE OF

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:57.109
WHAT'S AVAILABLE FOR NEW DRILL

02:11:57.175 --> 02:11:59.745
PERMITS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

02:11:59.811 --> 02:12:01.813
PROTECTION OF GROUNDWATER,

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:03.382
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PROTECTION

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:04.750
OF SPECIES, CULTURAL RESOURCES,

02:12:04.816 --> 02:12:08.954
ETC. SO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THE

02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:11.323
WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS TO

02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:14.192
ASSURE THAT, FOR EXAMPLE,

02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:16.728
YOU'RE NOT LOCATING A WELL,

02:12:16.795 --> 02:12:18.897
EVEN IF IT'S WITHIN AN EXISTING

02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:20.632
OIL FIELD IN SOME PLACE, IT

02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:22.167
ACTUALLY WHERE YOU'VE GOT SOME

02:12:22.234 --> 02:12:23.769
KIND OF PROTECTED SPECIES OR

02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:25.137
HABITAT. I MEAN, TYPICALLY THAT

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:25.737
WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN THROUGH

02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:27.939
SEQUA BECAUSE YOU DO SOME KIND

02:12:28.006 --> 02:12:30.909
OF, YOU KNOW, HIGH LEVEL REVIEW

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:32.144
TO IDENTIFY WHETHER YOU

02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:33.578
POTENTIALLY HAVE SPECIES THERE.

02:12:33.645 --> 02:12:36.114
AND THEN THAT WOULD BE WHAT

02:12:36.181 --> 02:12:38.016
WOULD TRIGGER THE STATE OR

02:12:38.083 --> 02:12:38.950
REGULATORY STATE OR FEDERAL

02:12:39.017 --> 02:12:40.852
REGULATORY PROCESS TO PROTECT

02:12:40.919 --> 02:12:42.020
THE SPECIES. SO WHAT HOW DOES

02:12:42.087 --> 02:12:43.789
THAT HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE

02:12:43.855 --> 02:12:44.990
SEQUA, YOU'VE GOT A COMPLETE

02:12:45.057 --> 02:12:47.259
EXEMPTION, RIGHT? SO IT'LL

02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:49.194
HAPPEN THROUGH THE

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:51.363
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROPOSAL

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.798
BY CAL GEM, WORKING IN

02:12:52.864 --> 02:12:54.433
CONSULTATION WITH OUR SISTER

02:12:54.499 --> 02:12:55.834
AGENCIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE

02:12:55.901 --> 02:12:59.404
FOR THOSE RESOURCE PROTECTION

02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:01.640
REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS. SO AS AN

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:04.509
APPLICATION FOR A NEW DRILL

02:13:04.576 --> 02:13:06.645
PERMIT COMES IN A IT NEEDS TO

02:13:06.712 --> 02:13:08.246
IDENTIFY THE TWO WELLS THAT

02:13:08.313 --> 02:13:08.947
THEY'VE ALREADY COMPLETED

02:13:09.014 --> 02:13:11.750
PLUGGING TO BE ABLE TO EVEN

02:13:11.817 --> 02:13:14.586
HAVE US CONSIDER THAT NEW WELL,

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:15.887
PERMIT. THEN WE WOULD GO

02:13:15.954 --> 02:13:17.856
THROUGH AND IDENTIFY THE

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:19.624
LOCATION OF WHERE THAT NEW WELL

02:13:19.691 --> 02:13:20.826
PERMIT WOULD OCCUR. OR EXCUSE

02:13:20.892 --> 02:13:22.894
ME, NEW WELL WOULD OCCUR,

02:13:22.961 --> 02:13:24.696
ENSURING THAT IT'S OUTSIDE OF A

02:13:24.763 --> 02:13:26.598
HEALTH PROTECTION ZONE. WE HAVE

02:13:26.665 --> 02:13:29.201
A PROCESS ALREADY SET UP

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:31.103
THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:13:31.169 --> 02:13:35.841
1137. WE WOULD UTILIZE EXISTING

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:37.709
RESOURCES TO DETERMINE

02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:41.346
PROTECTED SPECIES, DETERMINE

02:13:41.413 --> 02:13:43.348
WHETHER THERE'S A WATERWAY

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:44.950
INVOLVED, CONSULT WITH OUR

02:13:45.016 --> 02:13:46.585
PARTNER AGENCIES ON THAT TO

02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:47.853
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE CHECKED

02:13:47.919 --> 02:13:50.188
ALL OF THOSE BOXES IN TERMS OF

02:13:50.255 --> 02:13:52.090
THE CONDITIONS. SO THERE IS A

02:13:52.157 --> 02:13:54.693
ROBUST PROCESS THAT'S INVOLVED

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:58.029
IN ENSURING THAT THE NEW WELL

02:13:58.096 --> 02:13:59.998
PERMITS APPLICATIONS WOULD MEET

02:14:00.065 --> 02:14:01.032
ALL OF THOSE CONDITIONS

02:14:01.099 --> 02:14:03.168
OUTLINED IN THE BILL. THAT'S

02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:04.603
ANOTHER QUESTION, WHICH I'LL

02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:05.837
ASK LATER, BECAUSE I KNOW MY

02:14:05.904 --> 02:14:07.139
COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE QUESTIONS

02:14:07.205 --> 02:14:08.673
AS WELL. BUT I THINK THE LAST

02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:11.843
ONE WOULD BE WHAT KIND? I MEAN,

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:12.878
HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS EXEMPTION

02:14:12.944 --> 02:14:14.846
TO THE OVERALL PROPOSAL? HOW

02:14:14.913 --> 02:14:16.648
MUCH TIME DOES IT CUT OFF? WHY?

02:14:16.715 --> 02:14:19.317
WHY DID YOU NOT CONSIDER

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:21.286
SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE

02:14:21.353 --> 02:14:21.853
STREAMLINING PROPOSAL, WHERE

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:24.122
THERE'S AT LEAST SOME

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:25.957
OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC INPUT

02:14:26.024 --> 02:14:27.692
AND COMMENT? YOU KNOW, WE'RE

02:14:27.759 --> 02:14:30.128
TALKING ABOUT YOU SAID IT'S A

02:14:30.195 --> 02:14:31.830
FOCUSED EFFORT, BUT THAT'S THIS

02:14:31.897 --> 02:14:33.965
IS SOMETHING WHERE IT RELIES ON

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:35.901
IT WILL RESULT IN OIL WELLS

02:14:35.967 --> 02:14:37.969
THAT I ASSUME WILL OPERATE

02:14:38.036 --> 02:14:39.871
BEYOND THE TEN YEAR PERIOD.

02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:41.840
IT'S BASICALLY IT GOES ON FOR

02:14:41.907 --> 02:14:43.675
TEN YEARS. AND THEN SO I JUST

02:14:43.742 --> 02:14:46.378
WONDER IF YOU COULD SORT OF

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:47.012
TALK ABOUT THE TIMING. AND THEN

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:49.981
SECONDLY, HOW DOES THIS, YOU

02:14:50.048 --> 02:14:52.851
KNOW, HOW IMPORTANT WAS THIS

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:54.786
ASPECT TO THE PROPOSAL? RIGHT.

02:14:54.853 --> 02:14:57.622
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. SO IN

02:14:57.689 --> 02:15:00.826
THE CHART AS PART OF THE

02:15:00.892 --> 02:15:02.928
PACKAGE THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU

02:15:02.994 --> 02:15:07.265
IN THE PRESENTATION, USING THE

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:09.601
PROJECTIONS, YOU CAN SEE WHAT

02:15:09.668 --> 02:15:11.703
THE STATE WIDE TWO FOR ONE ADDS

02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:14.940
TO THE PRODUCTION STABILIZATION

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:16.808
EFFORT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'D BE

02:15:16.875 --> 02:15:18.910
GAINING IN TERMS OF MEETING

02:15:18.977 --> 02:15:20.645
THAT STABILIZATION GOAL THROUGH

02:15:20.712 --> 02:15:25.283
THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT IN IN

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:30.021
TERMS OF TIMING, AGAIN, PART AS

02:15:30.088 --> 02:15:33.058
VICE CHAIR TALKED ABOUT IN

02:15:33.124 --> 02:15:36.061
TERMS OF INVESTMENT CONFIDENCE

02:15:36.127 --> 02:15:38.897
AND MARKET STABILITY, SEEING A

02:15:38.964 --> 02:15:41.967
PATHWAY FOR NEW DRILLS TO HELP

02:15:42.033 --> 02:15:43.168
STABILIZE NEW DRILL PERMITS TO

02:15:43.235 --> 02:15:44.669
HELP STABILIZE THAT PROJECTION

02:15:44.736 --> 02:15:46.938
LEVEL. BUT THAT IT'S IT'S

02:15:47.005 --> 02:15:48.740
BOUNDED BY A TIME PERIOD WAS

02:15:48.807 --> 02:15:51.610
IMPORTANT FOR THAT NOT ONLY TO

02:15:51.676 --> 02:15:53.979
STABILIZE ACTUAL PRODUCTION,

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:56.515
BUT ALSO TO HELP WITH THE

02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:59.150
INVESTMENT CONFIDENCE,

02:15:59.217 --> 02:16:00.018
PARTICULARLY IN THE PIPELINE

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:02.854

UNDERSTAND SOME MORE ABOUT SORT

02:16:06.658 --> 02:16:08.426
OF WHAT IS IN THE CRITERIA THAT

02:16:08.493 --> 02:16:11.062
CAL CHEN WOULD BE USING ON THE

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:12.831
TO ASSURE THAT OTHER

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:13.932
ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS ARE

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:14.866

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:36.621
IMPACT COSTS TO THE DRIVERS AND

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:38.957
CONSUMERS? YES. AS I MENTIONED

02:16:39.024 --> 02:16:41.626
AT THE OUTSET, WE DO FOR MAJOR

02:16:41.693 --> 02:16:42.627
REGULATIONS, PREPARE A

02:16:42.694 --> 02:16:43.962
STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT

02:16:44.029 --> 02:16:45.664
ASSESSMENT THAT ASSESSES BOTH

02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:48.466
COST AND BENEFITS OF THE RULES

02:16:48.533 --> 02:16:50.936
AS THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED. AND

02:16:51.002 --> 02:16:52.804
THEN WHERE CAN WE FIND THAT

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:55.907
EACH REGULATION THAT WE ADOPT

02:16:55.974 --> 02:16:58.610
HAS A PAGE ON OUR WEBSITE, AND

02:16:58.677 --> 02:17:02.347
AND EACH REGULATORY PACKAGE HAS

02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:03.715

WEREN'T DOING THAT. IS THIS

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:19.264
SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST STARTED

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:22.033
BACK UP? NO, WE'VE ALWAYS DONE

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:25.103
THAT IMPACT ASSESSMENT. THE

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:26.671
CONVERSATION PREVIOUSLY WAS

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:28.773
ABOUT THE THE QUESTION OF

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:29.741
RETAIL PRICES AND RETAIL PRICES

02:17:29.808 --> 02:17:32.644
ARE DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE.

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:34.613
HOWEVER, THE OVERALL ECONOMIC

02:17:34.679 --> 02:17:37.115
ANALYSIS IS CAREFULLY

02:17:37.182 --> 02:17:40.986
CONSIDERED IN EXTENSIVE

02:17:41.052 --> 02:17:42.921
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT GOES

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:45.657
INTO WHAT WE CALL THE SYRIA.

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:46.992
THANK YOU. AND ALSO THE

ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH OUR

02:18:00.905 --> 02:18:02.674
SISTER AGENCIES ON THAT PLAN.

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:05.944
WE PART OF THE PROCESS WAS

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:07.879
DELAYED BECAUSE THE FUELS

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:10.015
ASSESSMENT THAT WAS ALSO CALLED

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:10.915
FOR IN LEGISLATION TOOK

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:13.084
ADDITIONAL TIME TO PREPARE, AND

02:18:13.151 --> 02:18:15.186
THAT WAS A DIRECT INPUT INTO

02:18:15.253 --> 02:18:16.588
THE TRANSITION PLAN. ONCE WE

02:18:16.655 --> 02:18:18.790
GOT THAT, WE WERE ABLE TO GET

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:20.625
STARTED. WE'VE GONE THROUGH

02:18:20.692 --> 02:18:22.694
NUMEROUS PUBLIC WORKSHOPS AND

02:18:22.761 --> 02:18:24.663
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AROUND THE

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:28.566
TRANSITION PLAN. AND, YOU KNOW,

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:30.135
VICE CHAIR GUNDA AND I WORK

02:18:30.201 --> 02:18:32.771
VERY CLOSELY ON THAT PLAN. WE

02:18:32.837 --> 02:18:34.706
RETAINED A CONSULTANT THAT DID

02:18:34.773 --> 02:18:37.275
A LOT OF MARKET AND ECONOMIC

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:40.812
ANALYSIS FOR THE PLAN. AND AND

02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:43.815
THEN EVENTS OVERTOOK US. AND SO

02:18:43.882 --> 02:18:46.885
WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

02:18:46.951 --> 02:18:50.855
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE THE

02:18:50.922 --> 02:18:52.590
ANALYSIS FROM OUR CONSULTANTS

02:18:52.657 --> 02:18:54.826
THAT HELPED INFORM THE WORK

02:18:54.893 --> 02:18:56.661
WE'RE DOING THAT WE DID ON ON

02:18:56.728 --> 02:19:01.166
VICE CHAIR GUNDY'S LETTER, AND

02:19:01.232 --> 02:19:04.335
WE WILL USE A LOT OF THE INPUT

02:19:04.402 --> 02:19:07.739
AND DISCUSSION AROUND THIS WORK

02:19:07.806 --> 02:19:11.142
TO HELP US PREPARE A DRAFT AND

02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:12.477
RELEASE IT LATER THIS YEAR OR

02:19:12.544 --> 02:19:15.580
EARLY NEXT YEAR. AND SO WE HAVE

02:19:15.647 --> 02:19:17.849
NOT BEEN LOSING TIME. THIS ALL

02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:19.617
WILL BE AN INPUT ULTIMATELY

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:22.854
INTO THE TRANSITION PLAN, AS WE

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:23.655
THINK ABOUT HOW BEST TO

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:25.724
ARTICULATE THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:27.492
ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND THE

02:19:27.559 --> 02:19:29.661
STRATEGIES THAT WE THINK ARE

02:19:29.728 --> 02:19:33.665
NECESSARY AS WE LAY OUT HOW WE

02:19:33.732 --> 02:19:34.899
CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE

02:19:34.966 --> 02:19:38.770
CRITICAL POLICY TOUCHPOINTS AND

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:40.038
ANALYSIS IN THE FUTURE, I LOOK

02:19:40.105 --> 02:19:42.073
FORWARD TO SEEING IT SUBMITTED.

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:44.642
THANK YOU. ALSO, VICE CHAIR

02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:46.211
GUNDA, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING

HERE AS WELL. JUST A QUESTION.

02:19:48.847 --> 02:19:50.815
WHAT ARE THREE THINGS THAT, AS

02:19:50.882 --> 02:19:52.751
LEGISLATORS, WE COULD DO TO

02:19:52.817 --> 02:19:53.918
STABILIZE THE FUEL SUPPLY, AS

02:19:53.985 --> 02:19:56.087
WELL AS BRING BACK THE

02:19:56.154 --> 02:19:56.721
INVESTORS CONFIDENCE IN

02:19:56.788 --> 02:19:59.357
CALIFORNIA? AND BASICALLY FROM

02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:00.725
NOW UNTIL SEPTEMBER 12TH, SINCE

02:20:00.792 --> 02:20:02.961
WE'RE FINISHED UP IN SEPTEMBER

02:20:03.027 --> 02:20:07.165
12TH. YEAH. THANK YOU. VICE

02:20:07.232 --> 02:20:08.600
CHAIR ON THAT ONE. SO JUST

02:20:08.666 --> 02:20:09.801
30,000 FOOT LEVEL. AND AS WE

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:11.936
LOOK THROUGH THE BUCKET TO, YOU

02:20:12.003 --> 02:20:15.273
KNOW, IMPORTANT THINGS AROUND

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:16.508
ENSURING THAT THE UPSTREAM, YOU

02:20:16.574 --> 02:20:17.842
KNOW, PETROLEUM STABILIZATION,

02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:18.977
CRUDE OIL STABILIZATION OCCURS.

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:20.912
I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:22.914
FOR THE SHORT TERM, I DO WANT

02:20:22.981 --> 02:20:25.517
TO MAKE SURE WE LAY OUT THAT,

02:20:25.583 --> 02:20:28.386
YOU KNOW, AS WE MOVE FORWARD

02:20:28.453 --> 02:20:30.188
WITH THE REDUCING DEMAND

02:20:30.255 --> 02:20:31.956
DECLINE IN CALIFORNIA, WE WILL

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:33.958
HAVE REFINERIES EXIT OVER TIME.

02:20:34.025 --> 02:20:34.993
RIGHT? SO THAT'S GOING TO

02:20:35.059 --> 02:20:36.728
HAPPEN AS THE DEMAND GOES DOWN.

02:20:36.795 --> 02:20:38.830
AND WITH THAT, THE RELIANCE ON

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:40.098
SPECIFIC CRUDE OIL PIPELINES

02:20:40.165 --> 02:20:42.801
WILL GO AWAY. SO I THINK TWO

02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:44.736
PARTS, ONE FOR THE IMMEDIATE

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:45.670
STABILIZATION AND ENSURING THAT

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:47.772
WE HAVE THE CRUDE OIL THAT

02:20:47.839 --> 02:20:49.007
STABILIZES AROUND 25, 30% OF

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:51.543
THAT SYSTEM. AND OVER TIME,

02:20:51.609 --> 02:20:53.311
HAVING THE ANALYSIS DONE TO

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:54.279
MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES

02:20:54.345 --> 02:20:56.214
TO ON THE REGULATORY TOOLS

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:57.715
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ENERGY

02:20:57.782 --> 02:20:59.350
COMMISSION, I THINK IT'S

02:20:59.417 --> 02:21:00.919
INCUMBENT UPON US TO THINK

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:01.753
ABOUT THE PAUSE ON THE MARGIN

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:04.155
GAP, YOU KNOW, AS WE CONTINUE

02:21:04.222 --> 02:21:05.523
OUR ANALYSIS AND REALLY DOUBLE

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:06.791
DOWN OUR EFFORTS ON RESUPPLY

02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:08.893
AND INVENTORY. SO WE'RE GOING

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:11.029
TO DO THAT. I THINK THE SECOND

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:12.197
MOST IMPORTANT, AND I THINK IN

02:21:12.263 --> 02:21:15.233
TERMS OF REALLY THIRD, YOU KNOW,

02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:16.868
FOR US AS A STATE TO ENSURE

02:21:16.935 --> 02:21:19.270
THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS FEEL

02:21:19.337 --> 02:21:21.673
HEARD AND ARE A PART OF THIS

02:21:21.739 --> 02:21:22.907
TRANSITION, I THINK WE REALLY

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:24.909
NEED TO INVEST TIME IN THINKING

02:21:24.976 --> 02:21:25.777
THROUGH BUCKET THREE. I

02:21:25.844 --> 02:21:27.745
APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK THAT

02:21:27.812 --> 02:21:29.547
OBVIOUSLY WE AGAIN, DON'T HAVE

02:21:29.614 --> 02:21:30.849
MUCH TIME HERE, BUT I THINK

02:21:30.915 --> 02:21:32.584
THIS IS SOMETHING URGENT THAT

02:21:32.650 --> 02:21:33.685
WE PROBABLY SHOULD WORK ON

02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:35.753
BEFORE WE LEAVE SESSION. SO

02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:36.855
WE'RE NOT WAITING UNTIL NEXT

02:21:36.921 --> 02:21:39.691
YEAR. THAT'S GREAT. AND THEN

02:21:39.757 --> 02:21:41.259
GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:44.696
ALSO, IF I MAY, DIRECTOR LUCAS,

02:21:44.762 --> 02:21:47.765
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT NOW,

02:21:47.832 --> 02:21:49.701
OUR OIL AND GAS OPERATORS ARE

02:21:49.767 --> 02:21:51.002
ALREADY REQUIRING TO PLUG WELLS

02:21:51.069 --> 02:21:51.836
UNDER CURRENT LAW, BECAUSE I

02:21:51.903 --> 02:21:53.771
KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD PUT

02:21:53.838 --> 02:21:55.807
IN WERE PLUG TWO WELLS. IF

02:21:55.874 --> 02:21:58.376
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP A NEW

02:21:58.443 --> 02:21:59.544
ONE. AREN'T THEY ALREADY DOING

02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:01.679
THAT? OPERATORS ARE REQUIRED

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:03.414
UNDER IDAHO. WELL MANAGEMENT

02:22:03.481 --> 02:22:05.783
PLANS TO PLUG IDLE WELLS UNDER

02:22:05.850 --> 02:22:08.219
VARIOUS CONDITIONS, AND THAT

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:10.722
THOSE PLANS CAN CHANGE AS THEY

02:22:10.788 --> 02:22:12.624
DECIDE WHETHER TO BRING WELLS

02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:15.994
BACK INTO PRODUCTION OR NOT.

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:17.996
THE PROPOSAL THIS PROPOSAL, THE

02:22:18.062 --> 02:22:21.799
TWO FOR ONE, IS TARGETED TO

02:22:21.866 --> 02:22:24.669
CREATE THAT BALANCE OF BOTH

02:22:24.736 --> 02:22:26.804
STABILIZING PRODUCTION WHILE

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:28.006
ALSO ADVANCING OUR PUBLIC

02:22:28.072 --> 02:22:30.141
HEALTH AND SAFETY GOALS,

02:22:30.208 --> 02:22:31.709
PARTICULARLY RELATED TO WELLS

02:22:31.776 --> 02:22:33.878
WITHIN HEALTH PROTECTION ZONES,

02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:37.181
AS WELL AS NOT EXPANDING

02:22:37.248 --> 02:22:38.850
EXISTING FIELDS. AND SO THAT'S

02:22:38.917 --> 02:22:42.053
WHY WE HAVE WHY THE PROPOSAL

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:42.820
INCLUDES PLUGGING TWO WELLS,

02:22:42.887 --> 02:22:45.089
ONE IN THE FIELD THAT THEY WANT.

02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:46.791
AN OPERATOR WANTS TO DRILL A

02:22:46.858 --> 02:22:48.993
NEW WELL IN AND TO THE SECOND

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:50.828
WELL IN A HEALTH PROTECTION

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:53.598
ZONE. OKAY, GREAT. AND THEN

02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:54.866
JUST HYPOTHETICALLY, WHAT WOULD

02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:57.001
BE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:59.170
STATE IN TERMS OF TAX REVENUE

02:22:59.237 --> 02:23:00.772
AND JOBS IF OIL AND GAS

02:23:00.838 --> 02:23:02.707
OPERATORS WERE REQUIRED TO PLUG

02:23:02.774 --> 02:23:04.175
TWO WELLS FOR EVERY NEW WELL

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:06.778
THAT IS DRILLED, I WILL HAVE TO

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:08.813
GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. OKAY.

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.782
THANK YOU. AND THEN JUST MAYOR,

02:23:10.848 --> 02:23:11.616
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. JUST

02:23:11.683 --> 02:23:14.085
ONE QUESTION. THE SUN REPORTED

02:23:14.152 --> 02:23:16.287
IN JUNE THAT THE SOON TO CLOSE

02:23:16.354 --> 02:23:17.722
VALERO SORRY VALERO REFINERY IN

02:23:17.789 --> 02:23:18.723
YOUR CITY CONTRIBUTES

02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:20.558
SUBSTANTIALLY. OF COURSE AMOUNT

02:23:20.625 --> 02:23:22.894
OF CITY TAX REVENUE AND 10% OF

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:24.696
ITS BUDGET. WHAT WILL YOUR CITY

02:23:24.762 --> 02:23:26.664
COUNCIL HAVE TO CUT IN ORDER TO

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.666
FILL THE GAP THAT'S CREATED BY

02:23:28.733 --> 02:23:29.867
THIS MAJOR EMPLOYERS LEAVING

02:23:29.934 --> 02:23:30.702
YOUR CITY AND MAYOR, I'M GOING

02:23:30.768 --> 02:23:33.004
TO VICE CHAIR. THAT'S GOING TO

02:23:33.071 --> 02:23:34.706
NEED TO BE THE LAST QUESTION.

02:23:34.772 --> 02:23:36.641
AND IF YOU CAN JUST ANSWER THAT

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:37.875
RAPID FIRE, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

02:23:37.942 --> 02:23:40.044
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WELL, OF

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:40.812
COURSE, THE ENTIRE COUNCIL IS

02:23:40.878 --> 02:23:43.081
GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

02:23:43.147 --> 02:23:44.082
LONG PROCESS OF MEETING WITH

02:23:44.148 --> 02:23:44.782
THE COMMUNITY AND LOOKING AT

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:46.951
ALL THE THE PARTS OF OUR BUDGET.

02:23:47.018 --> 02:23:50.188
BUT I CAN SAY THAT POLICE AND

02:23:50.254 --> 02:23:52.790
FIRE REPRESENT OVER 50% OF OUR

02:23:52.857 --> 02:23:54.726
GENERAL FUND SPENDING. SO IF

02:23:54.792 --> 02:23:56.928
YOU'RE GOING TO CUT THAT MUCH

02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:59.764
MONEY OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND,

02:23:59.831 --> 02:24:01.065
AND POLICE AND FIRE ARE OUR TOP

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:02.634
PRIORITY, THAT MEANS THAT A LOT

02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:04.769
MOST OF THE CUTS MIGHT FALL ON

02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:06.738
PLACES LIKE PARKS AND LIBRARIES

02:24:06.804 --> 02:24:10.942
AND SOME INTERNAL CITY

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:13.911
OPERATIONS. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S

02:24:13.978 --> 02:24:15.680
NOT UP TO ME. IT'S GOING TO BE

02:24:15.747 --> 02:24:16.781
THE COUNCIL GOING THROUGH A

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:17.982
VERY LONG AND BRUTAL PROCESS

02:24:18.049 --> 02:24:19.984
WITH THE COMMUNITY TO GET TO

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:20.952
THOSE DECISIONS. I APPRECIATE

02:24:21.019 --> 02:24:22.920
IT. THANK YOU, MAYOR. THANK YOU,

02:24:22.987 --> 02:24:27.325
MAYOR YOUNG CHAIR. BRIAN, THANK

02:24:27.392 --> 02:24:31.496
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I'M

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:33.998
CONFLICTED ON THIS TWO FOR ONE

02:24:34.065 --> 02:24:35.900
PROPOSAL. I HAVE THE LARGEST

02:24:35.967 --> 02:24:37.001
URBAN OIL FIELD IN THE STATE.

02:24:37.068 --> 02:24:39.070
IT'S SET TO CLOSE DOWN IN 2030.

02:24:39.137 --> 02:24:41.039
I COULD IMAGINE SCENARIOS WHERE

02:24:41.105 --> 02:24:42.673
FOLKS WOULD BE INCENTIVIZED TO

02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:44.208
HELP CLOSE THAT DOWN FASTER,

02:24:44.275 --> 02:24:45.977
BEING A GOOD THING. I GUESS

02:24:46.044 --> 02:24:48.613
SOME OF MY CHALLENGES GO TO

02:24:48.679 --> 02:24:50.548
THINGS THAT WERE RAISED BY SOME

02:24:50.615 --> 02:24:52.450
MEMBERS OF BURR AND ASSEMBLY

02:24:52.517 --> 02:24:53.818
MEMBER KALRA AROUND A CEQA

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:56.921
EXEMPTION FOR OIL DRILLING,

02:24:56.988 --> 02:24:57.789
EVEN IN EXISTING FIELDS, FEELS

02:24:57.855 --> 02:24:59.957
VERY CONCERNING TO ME. AND

02:25:00.024 --> 02:25:01.692
THERE ARE MANY COMPONENTS OF OF

02:25:01.759 --> 02:25:02.860
CEQA, INCLUDING SENSITIVE

02:25:02.927 --> 02:25:04.328
HABITATS. BUT TRIBAL

02:25:04.395 --> 02:25:05.563
CONSULTATION. I THINK THE

02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:07.965
CURRENT LANGUAGE SPEAKS TO AN

02:25:08.032 --> 02:25:09.067
ARCHEOLOGIST EVALUATING. BUT

02:25:09.133 --> 02:25:10.768
CEQA HAS A MORE EXTENSIVE AND

02:25:10.835 --> 02:25:12.804
MEANINGFUL TRIBAL CONSULTATION

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:14.272
PROCESS THAT WOULD BE

02:25:14.338 --> 02:25:15.506
CIRCUMVENTED IF WE WENT THIS

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:19.043
ROUTE. AND I'M CURIOUS WHAT

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:21.779
YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON ON WHETHER

02:25:21.846 --> 02:25:22.980
AN EXEMPTION FEELS RIGHT, OR

02:25:23.047 --> 02:25:25.349
PERHAPS EVEN A MORE LIKE A

02:25:25.416 --> 02:25:26.084
TAILORED STREAMLINING OF SOME

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:27.652
KIND, WHICH WOULD STILL BE

02:25:27.718 --> 02:25:29.253
RELATIVELY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH,

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:30.822
BUT TO ME FEELS A BIT MORE

02:25:30.888 --> 02:25:32.156
INAPPROPRIATE. ALSO, BECAUSE

02:25:32.223 --> 02:25:33.691
I'M CURIOUS IF SOME OF THE

02:25:33.758 --> 02:25:34.926
THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE

02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:36.494
MINISTERIAL AND THEREFORE COULD

02:25:36.561 --> 02:25:37.795
BE DIFFERENT IF YOU WERE NOT IN

02:25:37.862 --> 02:25:40.565
CHARGE, OR IF THE GOVERNOR

02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:41.999
SHOULD CHANGE IN, SAY, 2026 AND

02:25:42.066 --> 02:25:42.733
HAVE A DIFFERENT POSTURE. THE

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:44.802
FACT THAT IT'S NOT LEGISLATED

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:46.938
VERY CLEARLY, COULD THAT BE A

02:25:47.004 --> 02:25:50.541
PROBLEM? I THINK YOU AND

02:25:50.608 --> 02:25:52.710
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WERE RAISED

02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:54.846
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND

02:25:54.912 --> 02:25:56.981
IMPORTANT POINTS. AND JUST TO

02:25:57.048 --> 02:25:58.316
REFLECT EARLIER IN OUR

02:25:58.382 --> 02:26:01.652
PRESENTATION THAT THIS IS A

02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:03.321
STARTING POINT FOR THE

02:26:03.387 --> 02:26:05.089
CONVERSATION, AND I HOPE THAT

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:06.724
WE CAN HAVE ADDITIONAL

02:26:06.791 --> 02:26:08.659
CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS. THIS

02:26:08.726 --> 02:26:11.562
WAS A PROPOSAL TO WITH LIKE I

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:13.965
SAID, THE GOAL WAS TO MEET THE

02:26:14.031 --> 02:26:15.733
STABILIZATION GOALS WHILE ALSO

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.269
TRYING TO PROTECT AND ADVANCE

02:26:18.336 --> 02:26:20.805
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT RECENT

02:26:20.872 --> 02:26:21.539
LEGISLATION THAT THE

02:26:21.606 --> 02:26:23.674
LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED TO

02:26:23.741 --> 02:26:24.976
PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND PROTECT

02:26:25.042 --> 02:26:26.644
THE STATE FROM LIABILITY. AND

02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:29.881
SO IF THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO

02:26:29.947 --> 02:26:32.483
MEET ALL OF THOSE GOALS, WE ARE

02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:34.385
HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE

02:26:34.452 --> 02:26:36.254
CONVERSATIONS. I APPRECIATE

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:39.557
THAT. AND THEN, MR. GUNDA, WHAT

02:26:39.624 --> 02:26:42.860
IS THE COST TO CLOSE A REFINERY?

02:26:42.927 --> 02:26:44.695
AND IS THAT COST SOLELY BORNE

02:26:44.762 --> 02:26:47.732
ON THE REFINERY, OR ARE THERE

02:26:47.798 --> 02:26:48.599
INSTANCES WHERE REFINERIES HAVE

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:50.902
CLAIMED INSOLVENCY, LIKE IDLE

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:52.637
WELLS AND ORPHANED WELLS, AND

02:26:52.703 --> 02:26:55.039
THE TAXPAYERS HAVE BEEN HELD ON

02:26:55.106 --> 02:26:56.908
THE HOOK FOR FOR CLEANING UP

02:26:56.974 --> 02:26:58.009
AND REMEDIATING ALL OF THIS

02:26:58.075 --> 02:27:01.812
HARM? YEAH. THANK YOU CHAIR. I

02:27:01.879 --> 02:27:03.881
THINK THE ANSWER IS IF WE LOOK

02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:06.617
AT IT HOLISTICALLY, NATIONALLY

02:27:06.684 --> 02:27:07.718
OR INTERNATIONALLY, THERE ARE

02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:10.588
SEVERAL EXAMPLES WHERE THE

02:27:10.655 --> 02:27:12.590
OWNER OR OWNERS OF KIND OF

02:27:12.657 --> 02:27:14.192
DEALING WITH THIS HAS FELL ON

02:27:14.258 --> 02:27:15.927
THE COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE A

02:27:15.993 --> 02:27:18.029
REFINERY IN PHILADELPHIA RIGHT

02:27:18.095 --> 02:27:20.598
NOW THAT WAS CLOSED, AND IT'S

02:27:20.665 --> 02:27:22.099
BEING CONTEMPLATED FOR A

02:27:22.166 --> 02:27:24.669
DEVELOPMENT. AND IT'S, YOU KNOW,

02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:26.270
MANY YEARS NOW AND IT'S OVER

02:27:26.337 --> 02:27:28.606
500, YOU KNOW, MILLION IN COST.

02:27:28.673 --> 02:27:32.376
SO THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW, DO

02:27:32.443 --> 02:27:33.544
SOMETIMES FALL ON ON THE

02:27:33.611 --> 02:27:34.645
COMMUNITIES. I THINK IN

02:27:34.712 --> 02:27:37.014
CALIFORNIA, THE WATER BOARDS,

02:27:37.081 --> 02:27:38.950
THE REGIONAL WATER BOARDS HAVE

02:27:39.016 --> 02:27:39.684
SOME OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:42.587
AND, YOU KNOW, WITHIN THE PLANS

02:27:42.653 --> 02:27:44.956
THAT WE SEE, REFINERIES DO HAVE

02:27:45.022 --> 02:27:46.991
SOME PLANNING FOR THAT. BUT I

02:27:47.058 --> 02:27:48.593
THINK TO THE EARLIER QUESTION,

02:27:48.659 --> 02:27:50.661
THERE COULD BE GAPS IN THAT.

02:27:50.728 --> 02:27:52.964
AND THEN I THINK WE SHOULD

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:54.865
THINK ABOUT OVERARCHING HOW DO

02:27:54.932 --> 02:27:57.101
WE ENSURE TWO THINGS HAPPEN.

02:27:57.168 --> 02:27:59.904
RIGHT. SO ONE IS SAFETY AND THE

02:27:59.971 --> 02:28:01.672
SECOND IS LAND FUTURE OF THE

02:28:01.739 --> 02:28:04.275
LAND. SO THE FUTURE OF THE LAND

02:28:04.342 --> 02:28:05.843
AROUND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE

02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:08.946
ASSET RETIREMENT PLANS, CLEARLY

02:28:09.013 --> 02:28:09.714
ARTICULATING THE REMEDIATION

02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:12.383
PLANS AND HOW TO DO THAT SAFELY,

02:28:12.450 --> 02:28:13.618
I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT PART. I

02:28:13.684 --> 02:28:14.819
THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO

02:28:14.885 --> 02:28:16.087
DISCUSS AN OPPORTUNITY AND HOW

02:28:16.153 --> 02:28:17.888
BEST TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS. AND

02:28:17.955 --> 02:28:19.790
IF I COULD, I WOULD ADD THAT

02:28:19.857 --> 02:28:22.493
VALERO HAS ALREADY WRITTEN OFF

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:23.761
$331 MILLION ON THEIR BOOKS AS

02:28:23.828 --> 02:28:25.896
THE COST OF DISMANTLING ALL OF

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:28.032
THE REFINERY EQUIPMENT THAT

02:28:28.099 --> 02:28:29.734
DOESN'T GET TO THE COST OF

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:31.969
REMEDIATION. THE VALERO IS THE

02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:34.205
THIRD OPERATOR OF THIS REFINERY

02:28:34.272 --> 02:28:36.607
SINCE IT WAS BUILT, AND NO ONE

02:28:36.674 --> 02:28:37.908
REALLY KNOWS THE EXTENT OF THE

02:28:37.975 --> 02:28:39.143
POLLUTION. UNTIL EVERYTHING IS

02:28:39.210 --> 02:28:41.212
GONE AND YOU START DIGGING INTO

02:28:41.279 --> 02:28:43.748
THE DIRT. SO THAT WILL BE TENS,

02:28:43.814 --> 02:28:44.749
IF NOT HUNDREDS OF MILLION

02:28:44.815 --> 02:28:46.717
DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT. BUT THE

02:28:46.784 --> 02:28:48.085
REFINERY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:50.755
THAT. BUT THAT GIVES YOU AN

02:28:50.821 --> 02:28:52.623
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, I THINK, IN

02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:54.725
OUR CASE. AND I GUESS WHAT I'M

02:28:54.792 --> 02:28:56.627
GETTING AT AND THEN I WILL WRAP

02:28:56.694 --> 02:28:58.996
UP, IS JUST SHOULD WE REQUIRE

02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:00.097
MORE DISCLOSURE ON THESE COSTS

02:29:00.164 --> 02:29:03.234
AND THE ABILITY FOR THE OWNER

02:29:03.301 --> 02:29:04.502
AND OPERATOR OWNERS AND

02:29:04.568 --> 02:29:06.871
OPERATORS TO COVER THESE COSTS

02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:08.072
WHEN THEY ANNOUNCE CLOSURE

02:29:08.139 --> 02:29:10.741
PLANS OR EVEN PRIOR TO THAT,

02:29:10.808 --> 02:29:11.909
JUST AS THEY'RE OPERATING, SO

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:13.844
THAT WE CAN ALWAYS PLAN FOR THE

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:16.847
FUTURE DECLINE OF THIS INDUSTRY

02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:17.982
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE BURDEN

02:29:18.049 --> 02:29:19.617
DOESN'T FALL ON FRONTLINE

02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:22.887
COMMUNITIES WHO IT SO OFTEN HAS.

02:29:22.953 --> 02:29:25.056
RIGHT. YES, CHAIR. THANK YOU

02:29:25.122 --> 02:29:25.923
FOR RAISING THAT. I THINK IN

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:27.058
THE ROUNDTABLES, AGAIN, I WANT

02:29:27.124 --> 02:29:28.926
TO MAKE SURE I DO A FAITHFUL

02:29:28.993 --> 02:29:30.695
JOB OF SHARING THOSE

02:29:30.761 --> 02:29:32.229
CONVERSATIONS. IT HAS BEEN

02:29:32.296 --> 02:29:32.963
RAISED AS A VERY IMPORTANT PART

02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:35.099
OF THE DISCUSSIONS BY THE

02:29:35.166 --> 02:29:35.666
COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:37.668
THERE IS DISCLOSURE AND

02:29:37.735 --> 02:29:38.836
UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:40.004
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY AND

02:29:40.071 --> 02:29:42.139
SAFETY OF THE SITES AND THE

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:44.275
TRANSFER PLANS. SO I THINK ANY

02:29:44.342 --> 02:29:44.942
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT

02:29:45.009 --> 02:29:48.012
TRANSPARENT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

02:29:48.079 --> 02:29:49.714
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:52.116
MEMBER ERWIN, THANK YOU VERY

02:29:52.183 --> 02:29:54.285
MUCH. AND THIS HAS BEEN A VERY

02:29:54.352 --> 02:29:54.819
INFORMATIVE CONVERSATION.

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:56.787
APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU BEING

02:29:56.854 --> 02:29:59.690
HERE. SO I HAVE NOT DUG DEEP

02:29:59.757 --> 02:30:01.959
INTO THIS YET. THIS IS ONE OF

02:30:02.026 --> 02:30:03.994
THE FIRST TIMES THAT I'M

02:30:04.061 --> 02:30:08.733
LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL, BUT SO

02:30:08.799 --> 02:30:10.901
IF YOU THE CHART ON PAGE 15 HAS

02:30:10.968 --> 02:30:13.771
THE STATE PRODUCTION INCREASING

02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:14.939
AND THE CURRENT PRODUCTION

02:30:15.005 --> 02:30:15.973
INCREASING, THEY'RE BOTH

02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:17.942
INCREASING. IT LOOKS LIKE

02:30:18.008 --> 02:30:20.511
AROUND BY THIS SAME AMOUNT. AND

02:30:20.578 --> 02:30:23.681
WHEN I LOOK AT THE FOUR

02:30:23.748 --> 02:30:25.716
STABILIZATION PROPOSALS, I AM

02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:30.321
NOT SURE WHERE EACH HOW YOU'RE

02:30:30.388 --> 02:30:31.655
HOW YOU'RE FIGURING OUT THAT

02:30:31.722 --> 02:30:32.923
PRODUCTION, WHERE IS IT COMING

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:35.626
FROM. SO FOR INSTANCE, THE THE,

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:39.930
THE FRACKING PROHIBITION. HOW

02:30:39.997 --> 02:30:42.933
MUCH FRACKING IS THERE

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.036
CURRENTLY AND HOW MANY YOU KNOW,

02:30:46.103 --> 02:30:48.272
HOW HOW MANY BARRELS DO WE LOSE

02:30:48.339 --> 02:30:53.511
IF THERE IS A PROHIBITION? YEAH.

02:30:53.577 --> 02:30:56.914
SO JUST TO RESPOND TO YOUR

02:30:56.981 --> 02:31:00.351
INITIAL QUESTION RIGHT THERE,

02:31:00.418 --> 02:31:01.986
FRACKING IS NOT OCCURRING. NOW.

02:31:02.052 --> 02:31:04.889
THERE IS A BAN ON FRACKING THAT

02:31:04.955 --> 02:31:07.625
WAS IN EFFECT BEGINNING IN 2024.

02:31:07.691 --> 02:31:10.561
THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES ALL FOUR

02:31:10.628 --> 02:31:13.764
COMPONENTS BECAUSE, AS WE HAVE

02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:15.065
LEARNED, PARTICULARLY OVER THE

02:31:15.132 --> 02:31:17.835
LAST EIGHT MONTHS AND LONGER

02:31:17.902 --> 02:31:21.772
FOR VICE CHAIR GUNDA, THAT THE

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:26.076
OIL AND GAS ECOSYSTEM IS A AN

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:28.512
ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE, AND THAT IT

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:30.681
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN A

02:31:30.748 --> 02:31:32.283
POLICY DURING THIS TRANSITION

02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:35.152
IN ITS ENTIRETY. AND SO WHEN

02:31:35.219 --> 02:31:37.087
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:38.055
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL TO

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:39.657
STABILIZE IN-STATE PRODUCTION,

02:31:39.723 --> 02:31:41.559
YOU'RE LOOKING AT NOT JUST THE

02:31:41.625 --> 02:31:43.961
TWO COMPONENTS, BUT YOU'RE

02:31:44.028 --> 02:31:45.529
LOOKING AT WHAT ADDITIONAL

02:31:45.596 --> 02:31:47.932
HEALTH AND PROTECTION ASPECTS

02:31:47.998 --> 02:31:49.900
CAN WE INCLUDE IN HERE TO HELP

02:31:49.967 --> 02:31:51.469
CREATE A BALANCED APPROACH TO

02:31:51.535 --> 02:31:53.737
ALL OF THIS? AGAIN, THE GOALS

02:31:53.804 --> 02:31:56.373
ARE FROM THIS PROPOSAL TO MEET

02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:58.409
THE STABILIZATION GOALS, WHILE

02:31:58.476 --> 02:31:59.577
ALSO ADVANCING THE VERY

02:31:59.643 --> 02:32:02.012
CRITICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY AND

02:32:02.079 --> 02:32:03.147
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION GOALS

02:32:03.214 --> 02:32:04.582
AND POLICIES THAT THE STATE HAS

02:32:04.648 --> 02:32:08.252
PASSED AND HAS DETERMINED OUR

02:32:08.319 --> 02:32:10.688
PRIORITY. AND SO THAT'S WHAT

02:32:10.754 --> 02:32:12.790
THIS PROPOSAL IS, IS THE

02:32:12.857 --> 02:32:14.091
BALANCE LOOKING AT THAT

02:32:14.158 --> 02:32:17.428
HOLISTIC APPROACH. SO IN TERMS

02:32:17.495 --> 02:32:18.662
OF THE WELL STIMULATION

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.998
COMPONENT, AGAIN, THERE HAS

02:32:21.065 --> 02:32:24.268
BEEN NO FRACKING AUTHORIZED

02:32:24.335 --> 02:32:26.003
SINCE 2024. AND THIS WOULD BE A

02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:27.538
CODIFICATION OF THAT REGULATORY

02:32:27.605 --> 02:32:28.939
REGULATION. BUT IS THERE YOU

02:32:29.006 --> 02:32:30.774
SAID THERE'S NO BEEN NO

02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:31.675
FRACKING AUTHORIZED. BUT IS

02:32:31.742 --> 02:32:33.210
THERE FRACKING CURRENTLY GOING

02:32:33.277 --> 02:32:35.079
ON IN CALIFORNIA? NOT THAT I'M

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:38.082
AWARE OF. SO THERE ARE, BUT IT

02:32:38.148 --> 02:32:40.518
WOULD BE ALL FRACKING WOULD BE

02:32:40.584 --> 02:32:42.686
PROHIBITED. CORRECT. AND AND SO

02:32:42.753 --> 02:32:46.790
THAT'S LOSS OF BARRELS OF

02:32:46.857 --> 02:32:50.060
PRODUCTION. YOU'RE SAYING IT

02:32:50.127 --> 02:32:53.163
HAS NO EFFECT ON THIS CHART. SO

02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:57.134
IT'S NOT IN THE POTENTIAL IF

02:32:57.201 --> 02:33:01.005
THE STATE'S REGULATION BANNING

02:33:01.071 --> 02:33:04.975
WELL STIMULATION TREATMENTS IS

02:33:05.042 --> 02:33:06.877
NOT IN EFFECT AND THERE IS NO

02:33:06.944 --> 02:33:10.381
CODIFICATION OF THAT, THIS

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:12.583
PROJECTION PROJECTION CHART

02:33:12.650 --> 02:33:14.752
DOES NOT INCLUDE WHAT THAT

02:33:14.818 --> 02:33:15.920
POTENTIAL PRODUCTION FROM WELL,

02:33:15.986 --> 02:33:16.987
STIMULATION COULD BE. IT'S

02:33:17.054 --> 02:33:18.789
CURRENTLY NOT OCCURRING. OKAY.

02:33:18.856 --> 02:33:22.626
AND THEN FOR THE 2 TO 1 PLUG TO

02:33:22.693 --> 02:33:24.828
DRILL. SO I GUESS THAT PROGRAM

02:33:24.895 --> 02:33:27.731
AND THE PIPELINE SAFETY PROGRAM

02:33:27.798 --> 02:33:30.601
MAKES UP THE REST OF THE THE

02:33:30.668 --> 02:33:32.836
THE STATE INCREASE IN

02:33:32.903 --> 02:33:35.539
PRODUCTION. IS THAT CORRECT?

02:33:35.606 --> 02:33:37.007
THAT'S CORRECT. SO VALIDATION

02:33:37.074 --> 02:33:39.677
OF THE KERN COUNTY EIR AND THE

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:42.513
IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:44.181
ORDINANCE THAT REGULATES OIL

02:33:44.248 --> 02:33:46.250
AND GAS PERMITTING IN KERN

02:33:46.317 --> 02:33:49.687
COUNTY, PLUS THE STATEWIDE TWO

02:33:49.753 --> 02:33:52.523
FOR ONE WOULD MEET OUR OUR

02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:55.859
BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT

02:33:55.926 --> 02:33:58.629
WE'VE USED TO TO DEVELOP THIS

02:33:58.696 --> 02:34:01.932
PROJECTION WOULD HELP MEET OUR

02:34:01.999 --> 02:34:02.933
STABILIZATION GOALS. THE

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.635
PIPELINE SAFETY ASPECT, AGAIN,

02:34:04.702 --> 02:34:06.637
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT

02:34:06.704 --> 02:34:08.739
LEDGER TO HELP WITH IMPORTANT

02:34:08.806 --> 02:34:10.941
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. OKAY,

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:12.676
SO FORGETTING KERN, NOT THAT

02:34:12.743 --> 02:34:15.312
ONE. SO THE TWO FOR ONE I LOOK

02:34:15.379 --> 02:34:16.914
AT THESE FOUR MAIN COUNTIES. IT

02:34:16.981 --> 02:34:17.881
HAPPENS THAT MY COUNTY IS ONE

02:34:17.948 --> 02:34:19.850
OF THEM. WHAT IS THE

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:21.652
EXPECTATION OF INCREASED

02:34:21.719 --> 02:34:22.953
PRODUCTION IN EACH OF THESE

02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:25.055
COUNTIES. AND YOU SAID THERE IS

02:34:25.122 --> 02:34:26.790
STILL LOCAL CONTROL, BUT I

02:34:26.857 --> 02:34:29.660
DON'T THINK LA IS NECESSARILY

02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:31.729
GOING TO BE WITH LOCAL CONTROL.

02:34:31.795 --> 02:34:32.196
WOULDN'T BE INCREASING

02:34:32.262 --> 02:34:34.231
PRODUCTION. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:36.867
VENTURA, BUT IS THERE HOW DO WE

02:34:36.934 --> 02:34:38.569
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR

02:34:38.636 --> 02:34:40.871
CALCULATIONS ARE FOR. WHAT IS

02:34:40.938 --> 02:34:42.539
THE INCREASED PRODUCTION IN

02:34:42.606 --> 02:34:43.774
EACH OF THESE COUNTIES, AND DO

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:46.143
YOU HAVE WILLING LOCAL

02:34:46.210 --> 02:34:47.711
GOVERNMENT? THAT IS A GREAT

02:34:47.778 --> 02:34:49.013
QUESTION ON THE WILLING LOCAL

02:34:49.079 --> 02:34:50.381
GOVERNMENT. AGAIN, THIS

02:34:50.447 --> 02:34:52.783
PROPOSAL IS REALLY GEARED TO

02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:54.885
PRESERVING AND PROTECTING LOCAL

02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:56.754
GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING. IN

02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:58.856
HOWEVER, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:34:58.922 --> 02:35:01.058
WANTS TO IMPLEMENT THEIR

02:35:01.125 --> 02:35:01.759
DECISION MAKING AS IT RELATES

02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:03.961
TO NEW DRILL PERMITS. WITH THAT

02:35:04.028 --> 02:35:05.896
SAID, IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION

02:35:05.963 --> 02:35:06.930
ABOUT PRODUCTION, THAT'S THAT'S

02:35:06.997 --> 02:35:10.000
A MORE CHALLENGING QUESTION TO

02:35:10.067 --> 02:35:11.835
ANSWER IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

02:35:11.902 --> 02:35:14.038
POTENTIAL IS BASED ON POTENTIAL

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:16.840
NEW DRILLS IN PARTICULAR AREAS.

02:35:16.907 --> 02:35:18.709
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF A COUPLE

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:20.911
THINGS. ONE IS WHAT YOU'RE

02:35:20.978 --> 02:35:23.247
SEEING OUTLINED HERE IS THE

02:35:23.313 --> 02:35:25.182
POTENTIAL UNIVERSE FOR NEW

02:35:25.249 --> 02:35:27.151
DRILLS. BUT THE CONDITIONS

02:35:27.217 --> 02:35:29.753
OUTLINED IN THE PROPOSAL PLUS

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:30.788
LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECISION

02:35:30.854 --> 02:35:32.856
MAKING PLUS OPERATOR DECISION

02:35:32.923 --> 02:35:36.460
MAKING WILL REDUCE THAT AREA.

02:35:36.527 --> 02:35:39.897
AND THAT POTENTIAL. AND WE ARE

02:35:39.963 --> 02:35:43.033
USING AN ASSUMPTION OF A NEW

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:45.135
WELL BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE

02:35:45.202 --> 02:35:47.705
ABOUT 30 BARRELS A DAY. BUT

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:50.774
THAT IS BASED ON A RANGE OF

02:35:50.841 --> 02:35:52.810
ANYWHERE BETWEEN 15 BARRELS A

02:35:52.876 --> 02:35:54.611
DAY AND 50 BARRELS A DAY, AGAIN

02:35:54.678 --> 02:35:56.480
DEPENDING ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:35:56.547 --> 02:35:59.950
FACTORS. PRICE OF OIL, OPERATOR

02:36:00.017 --> 02:36:02.920
DECISION MAKING, TIMING, ALL OF

02:36:02.986 --> 02:36:05.756
THAT. SO IN WHAT WE'VE

02:36:05.823 --> 02:36:07.958
ESTIMATED IS THAT OUTSIDE OF

02:36:08.025 --> 02:36:10.327
KERN COUNTY ORDINANCE, WHAT

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:13.731
WE'D BE LOOKING AT IS NEW DRILL

02:36:13.797 --> 02:36:18.836
PERMITS OF ABOUT 360 ANNUALLY

02:36:18.902 --> 02:36:21.672
AND THEN DECLINING FROM THERE.

02:36:21.739 --> 02:36:24.508
NOW, HOW THAT IS ACTUALLY

02:36:24.575 --> 02:36:27.044
IMPLEMENTED BY OPERATORS AND

02:36:27.111 --> 02:36:28.846
WHERE THAT'S AN OPERATOR

02:36:28.912 --> 02:36:30.047
DECISION ON WHETHER THEY WANT

02:36:30.114 --> 02:36:31.749
TO KIND OF OPT INTO THIS

02:36:31.815 --> 02:36:34.118
FRAMEWORK. OKAY. SO I GUESS

02:36:34.184 --> 02:36:36.487
REALLY AND I SO THIS IS A VERY,

02:36:36.553 --> 02:36:37.821
VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE OF HOW YOU

02:36:37.888 --> 02:36:39.356
MIGHT INCREASE SUPPLY BECAUSE

02:36:39.423 --> 02:36:40.724
YOU'RE IT SEEMS LIKE THE

02:36:40.791 --> 02:36:43.193
EXPECTATION IS THAT THESE FOUR

02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:44.661
COUNTIES, WHICH HAVE MOST OF

02:36:44.728 --> 02:36:46.830
THE REST OF THE DRILLING, ARE

02:36:46.897 --> 02:36:48.165
THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE

02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:49.733
UP THAT DIFFERENCE. AND WE HAVE

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:50.934
NO IDEA WHAT THE LOCAL

02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:52.202
GOVERNMENTS OR LOCAL ORDINANCES

02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:53.804
ARE GOING TO BE DOING IN THOSE

02:36:53.871 --> 02:36:55.839
COUNTIES. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY.

02:36:55.906 --> 02:36:58.408
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

02:36:58.475 --> 02:36:59.343
LET'S SEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:36:59.409 --> 02:37:02.613
LACKEY. YEAH. THANK YOU I

02:37:02.679 --> 02:37:04.515
APPRECIATE THIS OPEN

02:37:04.581 --> 02:37:07.084
CONVERSATION BECAUSE CAL JAM

02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:09.987
AND CARB IN MANY WAYS HAVE A

02:37:10.053 --> 02:37:12.589
MORE DIRECT CONTROL OR IMPACT

02:37:12.656 --> 02:37:14.658
ON THE PUBLIC THAN WE, THE

02:37:14.725 --> 02:37:15.726
ELECTED LEGISLATURE. SO IT'S

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:16.860
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE

02:37:16.927 --> 02:37:18.862
COLLABORATING AND SPEAKING WITH

02:37:18.929 --> 02:37:21.498
EACH OTHER. I'M ONE OF THE ONES

02:37:21.565 --> 02:37:22.266
THAT ACTUALLY DECRIED THE

02:37:22.332 --> 02:37:26.270
POTENTIAL INCREASE COST FROM

02:37:26.336 --> 02:37:27.938
FROM LCFS. AND BECAUSE WE WERE

02:37:28.005 --> 02:37:31.141
QUOTING EXPERTS THAT GIVE US

02:37:31.208 --> 02:37:31.975
THAT INDICATION. SO I'M

02:37:32.042 --> 02:37:33.944
THANKFUL THAT THOSE DIDN'T COME

02:37:34.011 --> 02:37:37.414
INTO FRUITION. BUT I WILL ASK

02:37:37.481 --> 02:37:38.549
THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION, AND I

02:37:38.615 --> 02:37:39.917
HOPE YOU WON'T REFER ME TO THE

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:41.985
WEBSITE. I WANTED TO KNOW HOW

02:37:42.052 --> 02:37:44.454
MUCH PER GALLON, AND THIS IS TO

02:37:44.521 --> 02:37:46.723
MISS RANDOLPH. HOW MUCH DOES

02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:48.792
EACH CONSUMER IN CALIFORNIA PAY

02:37:48.859 --> 02:37:51.662
PER GALLON DUE TO LCFS? DO WE

02:37:51.728 --> 02:37:54.131
HAVE SOME ROUGH FIGURE THAT WE

02:37:54.198 --> 02:37:57.100
CAN REPORT BACK TO OUR PEOPLE?

02:37:57.167 --> 02:37:57.835
BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT, WE HAVE

02:37:57.901 --> 02:37:59.770
A VERY, VERY HIGH COMMUNITY

02:37:59.837 --> 02:38:02.172
DISTRICT OVER 100 MILES A DAY.

02:38:02.239 --> 02:38:04.675
SO THIS IS A REALLY BIG COST.

02:38:04.741 --> 02:38:06.710
YEAH, THAT COST FLUCTUATES.

02:38:06.777 --> 02:38:07.845
CURRENTLY I THINK IT'S AROUND

02:38:07.911 --> 02:38:11.215
$0.14 RIGHT NOW. THAT'S HELPFUL.

02:38:11.281 --> 02:38:15.252
THANK YOU. AND MY MY NEXT

02:38:15.319 --> 02:38:17.888
QUESTION GOES TO MISS LUCAS.

02:38:17.955 --> 02:38:20.023
AND I JUST NEED SOME

02:38:20.090 --> 02:38:20.924
CLARIFICATION. I KNOW WE'VE

02:38:20.991 --> 02:38:22.793
TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE THE TWO

02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:25.829
FOR ONE PROGRAM, BUT I JUST

02:38:25.896 --> 02:38:28.365
WANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION OF

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:30.400
ABANDONED WELLS VERSUS IDLE

02:38:30.467 --> 02:38:32.302
WELLS. THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT

02:38:32.369 --> 02:38:35.172
THINGS. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE

02:38:35.239 --> 02:38:36.106
SURE THAT THE TWO FOR ONE IS

02:38:36.173 --> 02:38:37.774
FOR IDLE WELLS AND NOT

02:38:37.841 --> 02:38:41.745
ABANDONED WELLS. SO THE WAY

02:38:41.812 --> 02:38:43.647
THAT THE TWO FOR ONE IS

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:47.751
STRUCTURED IS THAT THE OPERATOR

02:38:47.818 --> 02:38:50.787
CAN WOULD CHOOSE WHERE TO PLUG

02:38:50.854 --> 02:38:52.923
AND ABANDON A WELL WITHIN THAT

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:55.559
SAME EXISTING FIELD AND IN THE

02:38:55.626 --> 02:38:58.829
HEALTH PROTECTION ZONE, WE THE

02:38:58.896 --> 02:39:02.332
INTENT IS FOR IDLE AND ACTIVE

02:39:02.399 --> 02:39:05.602
WELLS, IN ADDITION TO THEIR

02:39:05.669 --> 02:39:07.037
COMMITMENTS UNDER THEIR IDLE

02:39:07.104 --> 02:39:08.939
WELL MANAGEMENT PLAN. SO THEY

02:39:09.006 --> 02:39:10.841
CAN'T USE THEIR IDLE WELL

02:39:10.908 --> 02:39:13.477
MANAGEMENT PLAN TO HELP MEET

02:39:13.543 --> 02:39:14.711
THAT TWO FOR ONE. WITH THAT

02:39:14.778 --> 02:39:17.247
SAID, WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:39:17.314 --> 02:39:21.518
THERE MAY BE WELLS THAT ARE

02:39:21.585 --> 02:39:23.720
DON'T HAVE A RESPONSIBLE PARTY

02:39:23.787 --> 02:39:25.956
AND THAT AN OPERATOR MAY ELECT

02:39:26.023 --> 02:39:27.758
TO ACQUIRE THAT WELL FOR THE

02:39:27.824 --> 02:39:29.893
SOLE PURPOSE OF PLUGGING AND

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:32.095
ABANDONMENT THAT CLEAR CUT.

02:39:32.162 --> 02:39:34.464
CORRECT. THAT'S KIND OF

02:39:34.531 --> 02:39:35.632
NEBULOUS. BASED ON THAT

02:39:35.699 --> 02:39:37.768
DESCRIPTION YOU JUST GIVE ME

02:39:37.834 --> 02:39:42.806
THE IDEA IS TO SEAL WELLS

02:39:42.873 --> 02:39:45.175
ACTIVE, IDLE OR WITHOUT A

02:39:45.242 --> 02:39:47.210
RESPONSIBLE PARTY WITHIN A

02:39:47.277 --> 02:39:47.945
HEALTH PROTECTION ZONE OR AND

02:39:48.011 --> 02:39:51.181
WITHIN THE FIELD. OKAY. TO HELP

02:39:51.248 --> 02:39:53.016
REDUCE THE INVENTORY. THANK YOU.

02:39:53.083 --> 02:39:56.887
THOSE ARE MY POINTS. THANK YOU,

02:39:56.954 --> 02:39:59.790
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGERS. THANK

02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:02.759
YOU SO MUCH, CHAIR. SO I WANT

02:40:02.826 --> 02:40:04.695
TO PIGGYBACK A LITTLE BIT OFF

02:40:04.761 --> 02:40:06.430
OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF BURR AND

02:40:06.496 --> 02:40:07.698
CHAIR. BRYAN'S COMMENTS ON THE

02:40:07.764 --> 02:40:10.500
CEQA EXEMPTION. AND YOU

02:40:10.567 --> 02:40:11.802
MENTIONED, I THINK, THREE

02:40:11.868 --> 02:40:13.804
DIFFERENT TIMES THAT IT WOULD

02:40:13.870 --> 02:40:14.972
BE THE THE INFORMATION THAT IS

02:40:15.038 --> 02:40:16.840
NORMALLY FOUND IN A DOCUMENT

02:40:16.907 --> 02:40:19.076
THAT YOU'D GET FROM EXISTING

02:40:19.142 --> 02:40:20.043
RESOURCES, AND YOU USE THAT

02:40:20.110 --> 02:40:21.778
PHRASE MULTIPLE TIMES. CAN YOU

02:40:21.845 --> 02:40:24.481
GIVE US SOME CONCRETE EXAMPLES

02:40:24.548 --> 02:40:25.615
OF WHAT THOSE EXISTING

02:40:25.682 --> 02:40:27.784
RESOURCES ARE, OR ARE YOU

02:40:27.851 --> 02:40:29.553
RELYING ON THINGS LIKE THE

02:40:29.619 --> 02:40:31.855
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

02:40:31.922 --> 02:40:33.256
THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE

02:40:33.323 --> 02:40:35.559
US CERTIFY AS COMPLETE AND

02:40:35.625 --> 02:40:42.632
ACCURATE? SO WHAT I, I MEANT TO

02:40:42.699 --> 02:40:47.170
TO CONVEY WAS THAT THERE ARE

02:40:47.237 --> 02:40:50.240
DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT

02:40:50.307 --> 02:40:52.776
AGENCIES HAVE. CONSULTANTS HAVE

02:40:52.843 --> 02:40:55.278
TO IDENTIFY AREAS AND WHERE

02:40:55.345 --> 02:40:58.048
PROTECTED SPECIES ARE OR ARE

02:40:58.115 --> 02:41:00.751
NOT WHERE WATERWAYS ARE, THAT

02:41:00.817 --> 02:41:02.819
COULD BE IMPACTED OR NOT. THOSE

02:41:02.886 --> 02:41:04.287
ARE THE EXISTING RESOURCES THAT

02:41:04.354 --> 02:41:05.789
I WAS REFERRING TO TO HELP MEET

02:41:05.856 --> 02:41:09.226
THOSE CONDITIONS. SO I THINK

02:41:09.292 --> 02:41:10.994
NOT TO BELABOR THE POINT,

02:41:11.061 --> 02:41:13.063
BECAUSE I THINK THAT MY

02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:14.064
COLLEAGUES HIT IT PARTICULARLY

02:41:14.131 --> 02:41:14.865
HARD. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO

02:41:14.931 --> 02:41:16.700
WANT SOME CONCRETE ANSWER ON

02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:18.101
WHAT THAT IS, OKAY, ESPECIALLY

02:41:18.168 --> 02:41:19.803
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE

02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:20.804
TRIBAL CONSULTATION OR

02:41:20.871 --> 02:41:22.639
WATERWAYS OR THE IMPACTS. JUST

02:41:22.706 --> 02:41:24.808
SORT OF A TRUST ME, THE

02:41:24.875 --> 02:41:27.477
BUREAUCRATS HAVE IT IS NOT A

02:41:27.544 --> 02:41:28.678
GOOD ANSWER THAT ESPECIALLY

02:41:28.745 --> 02:41:30.113
WHEN THE PUBLIC IS NOT INVOLVED

02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:32.149
IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY IN THOSE

02:41:32.215 --> 02:41:32.783
CONVERSATIONS AT THAT POINT. SO

02:41:32.849 --> 02:41:34.017
WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ON

02:41:34.084 --> 02:41:35.886
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE MOVING

02:41:35.952 --> 02:41:36.686
FORWARD. UNDERSTOOD. AND WILL

02:41:36.753 --> 02:41:39.823
DO, OF COURSE. GREAT. AND THEN,

02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:41.892
PROFESSOR, DO WE STILL HAVE

02:41:41.958 --> 02:41:47.064
PROFESSOR GRUBER WITH US? YES.

02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:49.533
I WAS STRUCK AND I TOOK A NOTE

02:41:49.599 --> 02:41:52.135
DOWN YOUR COMMENT ABOUT HOW THE

02:41:52.202 --> 02:41:55.172
PUBLIC ALREADY OWNS THE RISK OF

02:41:55.238 --> 02:41:56.640
THIS TRANSITION. AND YOU'VE

02:41:56.706 --> 02:41:57.908
TALKED ABOUT WHERE IT HAS NOT

02:41:57.974 --> 02:41:59.643
BEEN HANDLED WELL WITH COAL.

02:41:59.709 --> 02:42:01.812
ARE THERE ANY EXAMPLES THAT YOU

02:42:01.878 --> 02:42:03.980
CAN POINT TO, ESPECIALLY HERE,

02:42:04.047 --> 02:42:04.781
THAT THIS IS ON THE TABLE AS

02:42:04.848 --> 02:42:06.883
PART OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:09.219
HOW WE MANAGE THIS TRANSITION,

02:42:09.286 --> 02:42:12.956
ARE THERE ANY STATUTES, ANY

02:42:13.023 --> 02:42:14.858
STATES, ANY OTHER COUNTRIES,

02:42:14.925 --> 02:42:16.893
WHETHER IT'S FROM COAL OR OTHER

02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:19.062
TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

02:42:19.129 --> 02:42:20.397
YOU THINK HAVE HANDLED THAT

02:42:20.464 --> 02:42:22.265
TRANSITION WELL, THAT COULD

02:42:22.332 --> 02:42:24.367
MEANINGFULLY INFORM HOW WE

02:42:24.434 --> 02:42:25.702
COULD DO THIS WITH FOSSIL FUELS

02:42:25.769 --> 02:42:29.272
IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH. THANK YOU

02:42:29.339 --> 02:42:30.006
FOR THE QUESTION. AND I THINK

02:42:30.073 --> 02:42:31.741
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I TALK

02:42:31.808 --> 02:42:33.944
ABOUT A LOT IS WE DON'T HAVE A

02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:35.579
TON OF GREAT EXAMPLES OF THIS

02:42:35.645 --> 02:42:36.880
WORKING REALLY WELL BECAUSE WE

02:42:36.947 --> 02:42:38.381
HAVEN'T HAD TO DO IT BEFORE,

02:42:38.448 --> 02:42:39.616
PARTIALLY. AND THEN ALSO JUST

02:42:39.683 --> 02:42:40.717
IN THE CONTEXT OF GOVERNANCE

02:42:40.784 --> 02:42:42.018
PERSPECTIVES, THE UNITED STATES

02:42:42.085 --> 02:42:43.620
IS ESSENTIALLY UNIQUE IN THE

02:42:43.687 --> 02:42:44.754
FACT THAT MANY OF THESE ASSETS

02:42:44.821 --> 02:42:45.956
ARE PRIVATELY OWNED. GENERALLY

02:42:46.022 --> 02:42:47.858
SPEAKING, A LOT OF THESE SORT

02:42:47.924 --> 02:42:48.925
OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES

02:42:48.992 --> 02:42:50.060
THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LET

02:42:50.127 --> 02:42:52.829
LEAVE, WHICH IS BASICALLY WHY

02:42:52.896 --> 02:42:53.730
THE THE RISK IS ALREADY

02:42:53.797 --> 02:42:55.765
PUBLICLY OWNED. MANY CASES,

02:42:55.832 --> 02:42:57.134
THOSE ARE ALREADY PUBLICLY

02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:57.767
OWNED, AND THAT'S MORE TYPICAL

02:42:57.834 --> 02:42:59.202
INTERNATIONALLY. SO I DON'T

02:42:59.269 --> 02:43:00.837
WANT TO IMPLY THAT THE FACT

02:43:00.904 --> 02:43:03.073
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A TON OF

02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:03.773
EXAMPLES OF THIS MEANS THAT

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:05.008
IT'S A COMPLETELY BRAND NEW

02:43:05.075 --> 02:43:06.910
THING. IT'S MAYBE MORE THAT THE

02:43:06.977 --> 02:43:07.844
THE STRUCTURE OF HAVING PUBLIC

02:43:07.911 --> 02:43:08.912
MANAGEMENT OF THESE KINDS OF

02:43:08.979 --> 02:43:10.814
ASSETS IS ACTUALLY MORE TYPICAL

02:43:10.881 --> 02:43:11.781
GLOBALLY. BUT IN TERMS OF

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:13.750
EXAMPLES THAT I THINK ARE GOOD,

02:43:13.817 --> 02:43:15.986
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SPEND

02:43:16.052 --> 02:43:17.687
A LOT OF MY TIME ON IS THINKING

02:43:17.754 --> 02:43:18.755
ABOUT ADVANCED NOTICE FOR

02:43:18.822 --> 02:43:19.956
CLOSURES. AND I KNOW MAYOR

02:43:20.023 --> 02:43:20.790
YOUNG BROUGHT THIS UP. IT'S

02:43:20.857 --> 02:43:22.626
ACTUALLY THE TOPIC OF ONE OF

02:43:22.692 --> 02:43:23.760
THE PROJECTS I'M WORKING ON

02:43:23.827 --> 02:43:24.828
RIGHT NOW IN THE POWER SECTOR,

02:43:24.895 --> 02:43:26.630
BUT REALLY THINKING ABOUT

02:43:26.696 --> 02:43:27.731
DEADLINES AND REGULATORY

02:43:27.797 --> 02:43:29.633
TARGETS THAT TRULY TRY TO ALIGN

02:43:29.699 --> 02:43:31.868
SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN A WAY THAT

02:43:31.935 --> 02:43:32.936
ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THIS

02:43:33.003 --> 02:43:34.771
TRANSITION HAPPENING. SO THE

02:43:34.838 --> 02:43:36.273
EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED STATES

02:43:36.339 --> 02:43:37.841
THAT I THINK IS ACTUALLY QUITE

02:43:37.908 --> 02:43:38.542
AN INTERESTING ONE THAT'S

02:43:38.608 --> 02:43:40.810
CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IS IN THE

02:43:40.877 --> 02:43:42.279
STATE OF ILLINOIS, WHICH HAS

02:43:42.345 --> 02:43:43.713
TALKED ABOUT VERY EXPLICIT

02:43:43.780 --> 02:43:45.015
TARGETS FOR WHEN THEIR COAL

02:43:45.081 --> 02:43:46.583
FIRED POWER PLANTS ARE REQUIRED

02:43:46.650 --> 02:43:48.785
TO CLOSE, AND THEN HAS ALSO PUT

02:43:48.852 --> 02:43:49.886
INTO PLACE QUITE A BIT OF

02:43:49.953 --> 02:43:51.521
PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES

02:43:51.588 --> 02:43:52.923
THAT RELY ON COAL MINING OR

02:43:52.989 --> 02:43:54.891
SOME OF THOSE PLANTS. IT'S NOT

02:43:54.958 --> 02:43:56.560
PERFECT. THEY'RE ALSO NOT AT

02:43:56.626 --> 02:43:58.028
THE END OF THAT PROCESS. BUT I

02:43:58.094 --> 02:43:59.829
THINK THAT THE NOTION THAT

02:43:59.896 --> 02:44:00.564
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY

02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:01.731
TRYING TO REALLY COMMUNICATE

02:44:01.798 --> 02:44:02.966
VERY EARLY WHEN THESE TARGET

02:44:03.033 --> 02:44:04.834
DEADLINES MIGHT BE, IS REALLY

02:44:04.901 --> 02:44:05.569
IMPORTANT. CALIFORNIA COMES UP,

02:44:05.635 --> 02:44:08.171
I THINK, IN THIS REGARD,

02:44:08.238 --> 02:44:08.905
BECAUSE THERE ARE QUITE CLEAR

02:44:08.972 --> 02:44:10.574
DATES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:12.876
MANY OF THE THE STATE'S TARGETS,

02:44:12.943 --> 02:44:14.511
BUT THAT'S NOT DONE AT AN ASSET

02:44:14.578 --> 02:44:15.946
LEVEL, PARTICULARLY. SO

02:44:16.012 --> 02:44:16.880
SOMETHING LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE

02:44:16.947 --> 02:44:19.316
2045 CARBON NEUTRALITY TARGET

02:44:19.382 --> 02:44:20.750
DOESN'T EXPLICITLY SAY THIS

02:44:20.817 --> 02:44:23.119
ASSET THIS YEAR. I THINK ONE OF

02:44:23.186 --> 02:44:24.854
THE THE ARGUMENTS FOR MORE

02:44:24.921 --> 02:44:26.890
PUBLIC MANAGEMENT OF SOME OF

02:44:26.957 --> 02:44:27.624
THESE TIMELINES IS THAT THAT

02:44:27.691 --> 02:44:28.892
GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:44:28.959 --> 02:44:31.261
SPACE TO HAVE SOME WIGGLE ROOM

02:44:31.328 --> 02:44:32.662
IF YOU NEED TO IN AN EMERGENCY

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:33.597
SITUATION. SO, FOR EXAMPLE,

02:44:33.663 --> 02:44:35.298
ORMOND BEACH, THE POWER PLANTS

02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:37.400
DOWN IN LA THAT HAVE HAD TO HAD

02:44:37.467 --> 02:44:37.968
THEIR LIFESPANS EXTENDED A

02:44:38.034 --> 02:44:40.170
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE OF SUPPLY

02:44:40.237 --> 02:44:41.671
CONCERNS, BEING ABLE TO MANAGE

02:44:41.738 --> 02:44:42.739
THAT DIRECTLY WITHOUT HAVING TO

02:44:42.806 --> 02:44:44.741
RENEGOTIATE EVERY TIME IS AN

02:44:44.808 --> 02:44:46.476
ARGUMENT FOR GREATER PUBLIC

02:44:46.543 --> 02:44:48.111
CONTROL. BUT IN GENERAL, YES,

02:44:48.178 --> 02:44:49.613
THINGS THAT REALLY LINE UP

02:44:49.679 --> 02:44:51.748
ASSET DEADLINES AND COMMUNICATE

02:44:51.815 --> 02:44:52.782
VERY CLEARLY TIMELINES FOR WHEN

02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:56.186
A NEW SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE HAVE TENDED TO

02:44:56.253 --> 02:44:57.988
BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. GREAT.

02:44:58.054 --> 02:44:59.022
THANK YOU SO MUCH, PROFESSOR.

02:44:59.089 --> 02:45:00.657
AND I THINK A QUESTION THAT

02:45:00.724 --> 02:45:03.493
I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER IS FOR

02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:04.794
THE VICE CHAIR. WE'VE HEARD YOU

02:45:04.861 --> 02:45:05.829
SPEAK A NUMBER OF TIMES, AND I

02:45:05.895 --> 02:45:10.400
ALWAYS. YOU HAVE

02:45:10.467 --> 02:45:11.768
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THAT

02:45:11.835 --> 02:45:13.603
VOLATILITY IN CALIFORNIA IS

02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:15.839
ALSO LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE

02:45:15.905 --> 02:45:18.241
CALIFORNIA SPOT MARKET. YOU

02:45:18.308 --> 02:45:20.944
MENTIONED AGAIN TODAY THAT THE

02:45:21.011 --> 02:45:26.549
COMPACTION OR. LOSS OF OPTIONS

02:45:26.616 --> 02:45:28.685
FOR FOLKS AROUND REFINERY IS A

02:45:28.752 --> 02:45:30.820
PORTION OF THAT. HOW DO THESE

02:45:30.887 --> 02:45:32.555
STRATEGIES GET TOWARDS THAT

02:45:32.622 --> 02:45:35.225
COMPONENT OF THIS? AND CAN YOU

02:45:35.292 --> 02:45:36.660
TALK THROUGH HOW TO CONTROL THE

02:45:36.726 --> 02:45:37.794
VOLATILITY OR HOW TO ADDRESS

02:45:37.861 --> 02:45:40.964
THAT IN THESE PROPOSALS? LET ME

02:45:41.031 --> 02:45:43.300
ASK YOU TO ANSWER THAT VERY

02:45:43.366 --> 02:45:44.934
SIMPLE QUESTION IN 30S OR LESS.

02:45:45.001 --> 02:45:49.773
THANK YOU SIR. I CANNOT ANSWER

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:52.776
QUESTIONS, SO THANK YOU FOR

02:45:52.842 --> 02:45:54.044
THAT QUESTION. I THINK JUST

02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:55.679
KIND OF GOING BACK TO THE

02:45:55.745 --> 02:45:58.148
PREVIOUS POINT, WE OPENED THE

02:45:58.214 --> 02:45:59.716
THE PROCEEDING TO WORK ON

02:45:59.783 --> 02:46:02.419
RESUPPLY AND INVENTORY. I THINK

02:46:02.485 --> 02:46:04.554
TO YOUR POINT, THESE ARE

02:46:04.621 --> 02:46:06.189
STRATEGIES THAT ALL HAVE TO BE

02:46:06.256 --> 02:46:07.891
DONE CONCURRENTLY. YOU HAVE TO

02:46:07.957 --> 02:46:08.692
STABILIZE THE INVESTMENT SO THE

02:46:08.758 --> 02:46:09.959
MARKET WILL PUT THE MONEY IN.

02:46:10.026 --> 02:46:12.028
BUT AT THE SAME TIME ON THE ON

02:46:12.095 --> 02:46:13.730
THE OTHER SIDE, WE NEED TO

02:46:13.797 --> 02:46:14.964
BALANCE TO THE EXTENT THAT SPOT

02:46:15.031 --> 02:46:17.000
MARKET IS DRIVEN BY ILLIQUIDITY.

02:46:17.067 --> 02:46:19.502
AT TIMES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

02:46:19.569 --> 02:46:20.804
THROUGH SPECIAL SESSION TWO

02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:23.373
THAT RESUPPLY AND MINIMUM

02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:24.341
INVENTORY ARE REALLY IMPORTANT,

02:46:24.407 --> 02:46:25.041
AND SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO

02:46:25.108 --> 02:46:27.143
WORK ON THAT. THANK YOU. THANK

02:46:27.210 --> 02:46:29.946
YOU. AMAZING. ALL RIGHT. MOVING

02:46:30.013 --> 02:46:32.048
TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANSOM.

02:46:32.115 --> 02:46:34.017
THANK YOU. CHAIR. FIRST OF ALL,

02:46:34.084 --> 02:46:35.819
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I

02:46:35.885 --> 02:46:37.187
THINK THIS IS A REALLY

02:46:37.253 --> 02:46:38.555
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. I DID

02:46:38.621 --> 02:46:40.724
NOT EXPECT TO MY FIRST YEAR BE

02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:42.859
PART OF A CONVERSATION THAT IS

02:46:42.926 --> 02:46:45.829
THIS IMPORTANT. SO I HAVE

02:46:45.895 --> 02:46:48.631
QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEAR WITH ME.

02:46:48.698 --> 02:46:49.833
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IT MIGHT BE

02:46:49.899 --> 02:46:51.868
A LITTLE BIT REDUNDANT, BUT I

02:46:51.935 --> 02:46:53.803
WANT TO KIND OF EXPAND ON SOME

02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:55.004
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED

02:46:55.071 --> 02:46:56.840
ABOUT. AND I REALLY THINK THIS

02:46:56.906 --> 02:46:57.907
MOMENT SPEAKS TO OUR GOALS THAT

02:46:57.974 --> 02:46:59.809
WE'VE HAD AS A STATE VERSUS THE

02:46:59.876 --> 02:47:00.777
REALITY. IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE

02:47:00.844 --> 02:47:02.612
INTERSECTION OF WHERE YOU HAVE

02:47:02.679 --> 02:47:03.780
REALLY LOFTY GOALS AND THEN,

02:47:03.847 --> 02:47:04.981
YOU KNOW, YOU PLAN FOR THOSE

02:47:05.048 --> 02:47:06.549
THINGS AND THEN REALITY KICKS

02:47:06.616 --> 02:47:08.685
IN. AND SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU

02:47:08.752 --> 02:47:10.687
CAN KIND OF SPEAK TO SOME OF,

02:47:10.754 --> 02:47:13.056
YOU KNOW, THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:47:13.123 --> 02:47:14.090
TRADE OFFS. BECAUSE FOR ME,

02:47:14.157 --> 02:47:16.092
FROM AN ENERGY AND ECONOMIC

02:47:16.159 --> 02:47:17.827
SECURITY STANDPOINT, I'M

02:47:17.894 --> 02:47:19.129
DEFINITELY CONCERNED ABOUT, YOU

02:47:19.195 --> 02:47:20.930
KNOW, THE CLOSURE OF FACILITIES

02:47:20.997 --> 02:47:22.932
AND THE RELIANCE THAT WE HAVE,

02:47:22.999 --> 02:47:25.135
EVEN IN YOUR OWN, YOU KNOW,

02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:25.702
DEMONSTRATIONS, THE RELIANCE

02:47:25.769 --> 02:47:28.138
THAT WE HAVE ON THE FOREIGN

02:47:28.204 --> 02:47:29.739
SUPPLY. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:47:29.806 --> 02:47:33.042
ABOUT, LIKE THE TRADE OFF OF

02:47:33.109 --> 02:47:35.912
IMPORTS, WHAT HOW WILL THIS

02:47:35.979 --> 02:47:38.181
HELP IF WE ARE ABLE TO ADOPT

02:47:38.248 --> 02:47:39.749
THIS PLAN? DOES THIS HELP WITH

02:47:39.816 --> 02:47:41.818
LIKE THE EXPOSURE OF IMPORTING?

02:47:41.885 --> 02:47:44.187
I KNOW WE HAVE THIS AT BIRTH

02:47:44.254 --> 02:47:46.022
POLICY AND WE HAVE CLEAN

02:47:46.089 --> 02:47:46.623
PRODUCTION POLICIES, BUT THEN

02:47:46.689 --> 02:47:48.792
WE ALSO HAVE ALL THESE IMPORTS.

02:47:48.858 --> 02:47:49.793
SO DOES THIS HELP WITH SOME

02:47:49.859 --> 02:47:51.227
SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TRADE OFF

02:47:51.294 --> 02:47:54.164
AS WE LOOK NOT ONLY JUST TO

02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:55.665
KIND OF KEEP PLACES OPEN, BUT

02:47:55.732 --> 02:47:57.634
IS THERE AN ENVIRONMENTAL TRADE

02:47:57.700 --> 02:48:01.137
OFF YOU CAN SPEAK TO? I THANK

02:48:01.204 --> 02:48:01.704
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I JUST

02:48:01.771 --> 02:48:03.873
WANT TO TAKE TAKE A MOMENT TO

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:04.774
JUST RECOGNIZE, I THINK THERE

02:48:04.841 --> 02:48:05.909
ARE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF

02:48:05.975 --> 02:48:07.744
STRATEGIES THAT WE NEED TO

02:48:07.811 --> 02:48:09.078
CONCURRENTLY DO. SO I THINK THE

02:48:09.145 --> 02:48:10.947
FIRST PART IS, YOU KNOW, EVEN

02:48:11.014 --> 02:48:13.716
IF WE GO TO 1990, RIGHT, SO

02:48:13.783 --> 02:48:16.186
1990 AND YOU LOOK AT REFINERIES

02:48:16.252 --> 02:48:18.688
LIKE SHELL IN CARSON CITY, YOU

02:48:18.755 --> 02:48:21.090
HAVE SEEN THOSE REFINERIES

02:48:21.157 --> 02:48:22.926
CLOSE AND CONVERT TO PRODUCT

02:48:22.992 --> 02:48:23.893
TERMINALS, RIGHT? SO THEN THEY

02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:25.929
MOVE TO AN IMPORT STRATEGY.

02:48:25.995 --> 02:48:27.730
THIS WAS 30 YEARS AGO BEFORE

02:48:27.797 --> 02:48:29.732
ANY OF THESE, YOU KNOW,

02:48:29.799 --> 02:48:30.900
STRINGENT REGULATIONS. AND I

02:48:30.967 --> 02:48:32.635
THINK SO JUST WANT TO OBSERVE

02:48:32.702 --> 02:48:34.871
THAT THE CHANGING DEMAND

02:48:34.938 --> 02:48:35.905
CONDITIONS AND EVOLUTION OF

02:48:35.972 --> 02:48:38.775
MARKET MODELS WILL DRIVE MARKET

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:40.743
EVOLUTION AND HOW BUSINESS IS

02:48:40.810 --> 02:48:42.679
DONE. SO THAT'S ONE PART. AND

02:48:42.745 --> 02:48:44.848
SO WE CAN DEFINITELY EXPECT

02:48:44.914 --> 02:48:46.749
REFINERIES TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA

02:48:46.816 --> 02:48:49.285
OR CONVERT TO PRODUCT TERMINALS.

02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:50.653
SO THAT'S ONE OKAY. I THINK THE

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:51.921
QUESTION IS HOW FAST WILL THEY

02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:54.090
DO AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT.

02:48:54.157 --> 02:48:55.792
SO THE SECOND, GIVEN THAT SOME

02:48:55.859 --> 02:48:57.861
OF THESE REFINERIES WILL GO,

02:48:57.927 --> 02:48:58.928
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:48:58.995 --> 02:49:02.098
THINK ABOUT INCREMENTAL IMPORTS

02:49:02.165 --> 02:49:03.666
BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED. AND YOU

02:49:03.733 --> 02:49:05.535
ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT

02:49:05.602 --> 02:49:08.304
IN-STATE REFINING WILL GIVE YOU

02:49:08.371 --> 02:49:09.973
THE MOST RESILIENCY. BUT AT THE

02:49:10.039 --> 02:49:10.773
SAME TIME, THESE BUSINESS

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:11.674
DECISIONS ARE DONE BASED ON THE

02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:13.810
BOTTOM LINE, ON WHAT'S BEST FOR

02:49:13.877 --> 02:49:16.312
THE COMPANY'S ROI. SO AS THEY

02:49:16.379 --> 02:49:17.747
MOVE, I THINK THE IMPORTANT

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:20.183
PART IN SOLVING FOR IMPORTS IS

02:49:20.250 --> 02:49:21.684
NOT JUST IMPORTS, BUT THE

02:49:21.751 --> 02:49:22.852
STORAGE WITH THE IMPORTS,

02:49:22.919 --> 02:49:25.955
BECAUSE, AS YOU POINTED OUT, WE

02:49:26.022 --> 02:49:27.090
WILL BE VERY EXPOSED TO GLOBAL

02:49:27.156 --> 02:49:29.926
TRENDS BECAUSE OF IMPORTS. AND

02:49:29.993 --> 02:49:30.760
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE

02:49:30.827 --> 02:49:31.995
IMPORTS ARE COMING IN AND

02:49:32.061 --> 02:49:33.830
STORED IN CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN

02:49:33.897 --> 02:49:35.532
DIP INTO IT AS WE NEED. THAT

02:49:35.598 --> 02:49:37.800
SECOND. AND THE THIRD ONE IS

02:49:37.867 --> 02:49:41.004
ENSURING THAT THERE IS MARKET

02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:41.804
COMPETITION. SO CURRENTLY, YOU

02:49:41.871 --> 02:49:44.207
KNOW, THE THE TANKAGE THAT WE

02:49:44.274 --> 02:49:45.808
HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIRD

02:49:45.875 --> 02:49:47.911
PARTIES IS VERY LIMITED. SO HOW

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:49.679
DO WE ENSURE THAT THOSE TANKAGE

02:49:49.746 --> 02:49:51.047
IS AVAILABLE FOR THIRD PARTIES.

02:49:51.114 --> 02:49:52.348
SO YOU HAVE THE MOST

02:49:52.415 --> 02:49:53.583
COMPETITION POSSIBLE IN ANY

02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:55.318
GIVEN SYSTEM? I THINK TAKING

02:49:55.385 --> 02:49:56.819
ALL THOSE THINGS COLLECTIVELY,

02:49:56.886 --> 02:49:58.221
I THINK WE NEED TO SOLVE THEM.

02:49:58.288 --> 02:49:59.789
YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO SOLVE FOR

02:49:59.856 --> 02:50:01.958
IMPORTS. WE NEED TO SOLVE FOR

02:50:02.025 --> 02:50:03.293
RESILIENCY OF THE INDUSTRY TO

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:04.027
CONTINUE THEIR INVESTMENTS. AND

02:50:04.093 --> 02:50:05.929
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE NEED

02:50:05.995 --> 02:50:08.064
ADDITIONAL IMPORT BARRELS AND

02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:08.965
COMPETITION, HOW DO WE SOLVE

02:50:09.032 --> 02:50:10.867
FOR THAT? SO I THINK ALL OF

02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:11.801
THEM HAVE TO BE DONE

02:50:11.868 --> 02:50:13.703
CONCURRENTLY. AND DO YOU HAVE

02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:14.938
DATA POINTS FOR WHAT IT LOOKS

02:50:15.004 --> 02:50:16.639
LIKE WHEN WE HAVE THE FOREIGN

02:50:16.706 --> 02:50:17.807
IMPORTS? LIKE WE KNOW THEY

02:50:17.874 --> 02:50:19.842
DON'T HAVE THE SAME STANDARDS

02:50:19.909 --> 02:50:20.710
FOR CLEANLINESS, AND THEN WE

02:50:20.777 --> 02:50:23.446
KNOW THERE IS EMISSIONS AND ALL

02:50:23.513 --> 02:50:25.048
OF THOSE THINGS. WHAT ARE THE

02:50:25.114 --> 02:50:26.816
DATA POINTS BETWEEN YOU KNOW,

02:50:26.883 --> 02:50:28.851
BECAUSE I KNOW WE GOT WE HAVE A

02:50:28.918 --> 02:50:29.752
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF

02:50:29.819 --> 02:50:31.821
CONCERNS HERE. BUT WHAT IS A

02:50:31.888 --> 02:50:34.190
TRADE OFF LOOK LIKE FROM A DATA

02:50:34.257 --> 02:50:35.758
POINT. DO YOU HAVE LIKE A QUICK

02:50:35.825 --> 02:50:38.561
POINT YOU CAN HELP ME WITH? I

02:50:38.628 --> 02:50:41.831
GUESS I WILL NOTE THAT, YOU

02:50:41.898 --> 02:50:44.767
KNOW, DIFFERENT FUELS HAVE

02:50:44.834 --> 02:50:46.769
DIFFERENT CARBON INTENSITY

02:50:46.836 --> 02:50:50.206
PROFILES. YOUR POINT IS WELL

02:50:50.273 --> 02:50:51.441
TAKEN THAT THE TRANSPORTATION,

02:50:51.507 --> 02:50:53.109
YOU KNOW, IMPORTING FUEL INTO

02:50:53.176 --> 02:50:54.877
CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE WE DO NOT

02:50:54.944 --> 02:50:58.014
HAVE IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

02:50:58.081 --> 02:50:59.882
IMPORTING CRUDE, YOU'RE LOOKING

02:50:59.949 --> 02:51:04.721
AT. YOU KNOW, TANKERS AND

02:51:04.787 --> 02:51:06.556
YOU'RE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW,

02:51:06.623 --> 02:51:09.592
POTENTIALLY TRAINS. AND IF

02:51:09.659 --> 02:51:11.561
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IMPORTING

02:51:11.628 --> 02:51:13.830
GASOLINE FROM OTHER STATES,

02:51:13.896 --> 02:51:14.897
YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

02:51:14.964 --> 02:51:17.967
EMISSIONS FROM FROM IMPORTS AS

02:51:18.034 --> 02:51:20.570
WELL. SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, I

02:51:20.637 --> 02:51:22.805
THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN

02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:24.607
THAT THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER

02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:28.678
ALL OF THE THE CARBON INTENSITY

02:51:28.745 --> 02:51:30.780
OF FUELS COMING INTO THE STATE,

02:51:30.847 --> 02:51:34.183
WHETHER IT'S CRUDE OR REFINED

02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:35.785
FUELS. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

02:51:35.852 --> 02:51:38.121
RECOGNIZE, AS VICE CHAIR GUNDY

02:51:38.187 --> 02:51:41.457
MENTIONED, A LOT OF THIS

02:51:41.524 --> 02:51:43.559
TRANSITION IS REFLECTIVE OF A

02:51:43.626 --> 02:51:45.795
GLOBAL TRANSITION TOWARD

02:51:45.862 --> 02:51:47.296
CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY,

02:51:47.363 --> 02:51:49.932
TOWARDS, YOU KNOW, REFINERIES

02:51:49.999 --> 02:51:52.669
THAT ARE ARE PUTTING PRODUCT ON

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:53.870
THE MARKET THAT'S THAT'S

02:51:53.936 --> 02:51:55.638
CHEAPER. AND SO THOSE ARE THE

02:51:55.705 --> 02:51:57.707
KIND OF THINGS THAT WE AS A

02:51:57.774 --> 02:51:58.841
STATE CAN'T CONTROL. SO WE JUST

02:51:58.908 --> 02:52:01.077
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO

02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:01.944
REACT TO THOSE KIND OF

02:52:02.011 --> 02:52:03.913
CONDITIONS. OKAY. SO IT SOUNDS

02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:04.914
LIKE THERE'S NOT LIKE A FINE

02:52:04.981 --> 02:52:06.649
DATA POINT. SO BUT REALLY IT'S

02:52:06.716 --> 02:52:07.850
FINE. BUT I GUESS MY NEXT

02:52:07.917 --> 02:52:10.653
QUESTION IS IF THIS PLAN IS

02:52:10.720 --> 02:52:12.855
ADOPTED, HOW QUICKLY WOULD THIS

02:52:12.922 --> 02:52:16.359
HELP KIND OF BUILD THE SUPPLY

02:52:16.426 --> 02:52:19.562
FOR CALIFORNIA? BECAUSE WE ARE

02:52:19.629 --> 02:52:23.166
SEEING THAT THE SUPPLY IS IS IS

02:52:23.232 --> 02:52:25.768
DECLINING FASTER THAN THE USE.

02:52:25.835 --> 02:52:28.571
SO HOW I KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER

02:52:28.638 --> 02:52:29.872
OF CAN YOU GIVE ME PERCENTAGE

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:31.574
BECAUSE I SEE THAT. WHAT IS IT

02:52:31.641 --> 02:52:34.010
LIKE 3 BILLION BARRELS A DAY OR

02:52:34.077 --> 02:52:34.844
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT CAN

02:52:34.911 --> 02:52:36.079
YOU GIVE ME LIKE WHAT THAT

02:52:36.145 --> 02:52:37.880
LOOKS LIKE PERCENTAGE WISE AS

02:52:37.947 --> 02:52:39.148
FAR AS LIKE ACTUALLY BEING ABLE

02:52:39.215 --> 02:52:41.818
TO BE HELPFUL TO OUR ISSUE? I

02:52:41.884 --> 02:52:43.886
CAN START WITH HOW IMMEDIATE WE

02:52:43.953 --> 02:52:47.190
WILL SEE PRODUCTION FROM THIS

02:52:47.256 --> 02:52:51.594
PROPOSAL. SO WITH THE

02:52:51.661 --> 02:52:53.529
VALIDATION OF THE KERN COUNTY

02:52:53.596 --> 02:52:56.899
EIR, IN CONSULTATION WITH KERN

02:52:56.966 --> 02:52:59.235
COUNTY PLANNING OFFICIALS,

02:52:59.302 --> 02:53:02.338
PERMITS CAN START BEING ISSUED

02:53:02.405 --> 02:53:03.639
PRETTY IMMEDIATELY. WITH THAT

02:53:03.706 --> 02:53:06.242
SAID, THERE IS A LAG TIME

02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:07.944
BETWEEN PERMITS BEING ISSUED

02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:11.781
AND OPERATORS THEN UTILIZING

02:53:11.848 --> 02:53:13.883
THOSE PERMITS TO START DRILLING.

02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:17.653
SO WE WOULD LIKE WE HOPE TO SEE

02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:20.089
INCREASE IN PRODUCTION

02:53:20.156 --> 02:53:22.925
THROUGHOUT NEXT YEAR AS AS

02:53:22.992 --> 02:53:24.861
PERMITS ARE ISSUED,

02:53:24.927 --> 02:53:26.562
PARTICULARLY IN KERN COUNTY.

02:53:26.629 --> 02:53:29.499
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A RAMP UP

02:53:29.565 --> 02:53:34.270
OVER TIME OF. ABOUT 17 OR,

02:53:34.337 --> 02:53:35.571
EXCUSE ME, A THOUSAND PERMITS

02:53:35.638 --> 02:53:37.640
THROUGH NEXT YEAR AND THEN

02:53:37.707 --> 02:53:39.842
INCREASING FROM THERE. GOT IT.

02:53:39.909 --> 02:53:41.577
AND THEN LASTLY KIND OF WITH

02:53:41.644 --> 02:53:44.547
THE CEQA EXEMPTIONS, THE WAY

02:53:44.614 --> 02:53:46.783
I'M LOOKING AT THIS, CORRECT ME

02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:48.084
IF I'M WRONG, IT LOOKS LIKE

02:53:48.151 --> 02:53:50.219
THERE'S GOING TO KIND OF BE

02:53:50.286 --> 02:53:51.754
SOME SELF-IMPOSED, YOU KNOW,

02:53:51.821 --> 02:53:54.657
EIR TYPE REPORTING. WILL THIS

02:53:54.724 --> 02:53:56.859
BE LIKE ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE,

02:53:56.926 --> 02:53:58.961
LIKE THE REPORTING OF THE

02:53:59.028 --> 02:54:00.096
INFORMATION OR THE

02:54:00.163 --> 02:54:03.666
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS THAT

02:54:03.733 --> 02:54:06.002
YOU'LL BE DOING AS PART OF THIS

02:54:06.068 --> 02:54:08.070
PRACTICE? IF WE'RE GOING TO NOT

02:54:08.137 --> 02:54:09.105
USE THE TRADITIONAL CEQA, IF

02:54:09.172 --> 02:54:11.307
WE'RE GOING TO BE WAVING AND

02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:13.042
RELAXING SEQUA, ARE WE GOING TO

02:54:13.109 --> 02:54:15.311
BE RELYING ON YOU TO GIVE SOME

02:54:15.378 --> 02:54:17.713
REGULAR REPORTING OF THE

02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:19.649
PROCESS AND WHAT THE SO THE

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:22.151
COMMUNITY CAN SEE HOW SAFE THIS

02:54:22.218 --> 02:54:22.752
THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE?

02:54:22.819 --> 02:54:25.621
AND CAN I ASK THAT WE MAKE THIS

02:54:25.688 --> 02:54:26.856
THE RAPID FIRE QUESTION? RAPID

02:54:26.923 --> 02:54:28.958
FIRE. YES. WE HAVE REGULAR

02:54:29.025 --> 02:54:29.525
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT

02:54:29.592 --> 02:54:31.761
COULD BE BUILT INTO TO THIS

02:54:31.828 --> 02:54:34.063
PROPOSAL. OKAY. SO WE SHOULD BE

02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:34.764
ASKING SHOULD WE ASK FOR THE

02:54:34.831 --> 02:54:36.766
TIMELINES OF THAT OR IS THAT

02:54:36.833 --> 02:54:37.967
SOMETHING YOU'VE ALREADY. I'VE

02:54:38.034 --> 02:54:39.969
NOT SEEN IT. IS IT EXISTING

02:54:40.036 --> 02:54:44.006
ALREADY. OUR EXISTING REPORTING.

02:54:44.073 --> 02:54:46.843
OPT OR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

02:54:46.909 --> 02:54:50.213
ARE EXISTING ALREADY. I WOULD

02:54:50.279 --> 02:54:52.415
ANTICIPATE THE THAT PERMITS

02:54:52.481 --> 02:54:55.151
THAT ARE ISSUED UNDER A

02:54:55.218 --> 02:54:55.852
FRAMEWORK LIKE THIS WOULD BE

02:54:55.918 --> 02:54:56.819
REPORTED THROUGH THOSE EXISTING

02:54:56.886 --> 02:54:58.855
LEGISLATIVE REPORTS, AND ALSO

02:54:58.921 --> 02:55:00.556
REFLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE. THANK

YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

02:55:01.757 --> 02:55:03.759
DIRECTOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HART,

02:55:03.826 --> 02:55:08.130
DOES THE STATE MONITOR OR HAVE

02:55:08.197 --> 02:55:09.999
TRANSPARENCY INTO THE PIPELINE

02:55:10.066 --> 02:55:11.734
VOLUMES THAT ARE OPERATING

02:55:11.801 --> 02:55:13.636
CURRENTLY FOR CRUDE OIL? YOU

02:55:13.703 --> 02:55:15.738
KNOW, THE PREMISE OF THIS

02:55:15.805 --> 02:55:16.906
PROPOSAL, ONE OF THE BIG

02:55:16.973 --> 02:55:19.141
PILLARS IS THE IDEA THAT WE'RE

02:55:19.208 --> 02:55:19.909
GOING TO STABILIZE CAPACITY IN

02:55:19.976 --> 02:55:21.844
THOSE PIPELINES. AND I'M NOT

02:55:21.911 --> 02:55:23.212
AWARE THAT THE STATE IS ENGAGED

02:55:23.279 --> 02:55:24.747
ACTIVELY IN THAT ESSENTIALLY

02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:25.882
PRIVATE SECTOR ASSET AND

02:55:25.948 --> 02:55:27.550
PRIVATE BUSINESS. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:55:27.617 --> 02:55:29.752
HOW ARE WE GOING TO ASSURE THAT

02:55:29.819 --> 02:55:32.788
WE HAVE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION

02:55:32.855 --> 02:55:34.824
OF THE CAPACITY AND THE VOLUMES

02:55:34.891 --> 02:55:36.559
AND THE ENGINEERING AND

02:55:36.626 --> 02:55:37.560
MAINTENANCE AND ALL OF THE

02:55:37.627 --> 02:55:39.795
THINGS THAT GO WITH, YOU KNOW,

02:55:39.862 --> 02:55:40.963
PUTTING OUR EGGS INTO THIS

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.731
BASKET AND SAYING WE'RE WE'RE

02:55:41.797 --> 02:55:43.299
TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:44.800
WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION

02:55:44.867 --> 02:55:46.669
BACK ABOUT THAT SYSTEM. YEAH.

02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:48.938
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE.

02:55:49.005 --> 02:55:49.872
SO RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:55:49.939 --> 02:55:51.908
RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE DETAILED

02:55:51.974 --> 02:55:54.777
DATA THAT WE GATHER. WE WITHIN

02:55:54.844 --> 02:55:56.712
THE TOOLS THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US

02:55:56.779 --> 02:55:59.015
IN SB ONE TO AN AB 21, WE'RE

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:01.050
EXPLORING, IF WE COULD GATHER

02:56:01.117 --> 02:56:03.119
THAT INFORMATION, YOU KNOW,

02:56:03.185 --> 02:56:04.086
WITHIN WITHIN THAT STATUTE. BUT

02:56:04.153 --> 02:56:05.988
I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME

02:56:06.055 --> 02:56:07.323
LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE

02:56:07.390 --> 02:56:10.026
THAT INFORMATION TO THE CEC.

02:56:10.092 --> 02:56:11.928
AND FINALLY, FOR THE INITIAL

02:56:11.994 --> 02:56:13.696
ANALYSIS, WE HAD TO REALLY RELY

02:56:13.763 --> 02:56:16.899
ON PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

02:56:16.966 --> 02:56:17.667
PIPELINE HOLDERS. AND I JUST

02:56:17.733 --> 02:56:19.735
WANT TO THANK THE FIRE

02:56:19.802 --> 02:56:20.803
MARSHAL'S OFFICE WHO HAS

02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:22.405
ENGAGED, AND THEY COLLECT SOME

02:56:22.471 --> 02:56:23.839
OF THAT INFORMATION, AND THEY

02:56:23.906 --> 02:56:25.408
WERE ABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE MANY

02:56:25.474 --> 02:56:26.542
OF THE ASSERTIONS AND PROVIDE

02:56:26.609 --> 02:56:27.877
US GUIDANCE ON THAT. BUT IT

02:56:27.944 --> 02:56:29.879
WOULD BE VALUABLE AND IMPORTANT

02:56:29.946 --> 02:56:31.580
GOING FORWARD TO HAVE A BETTER,

02:56:31.647 --> 02:56:33.049
TIGHTER RELATIONSHIP WITH STATE

02:56:33.115 --> 02:56:33.816
REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE

02:56:33.883 --> 02:56:35.217
OPERATION OF THOSE PIPELINES TO

02:56:35.284 --> 02:56:36.719
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING

02:56:36.786 --> 02:56:37.853
THE METRICS THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:39.689
ABOUT. ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK

02:56:39.755 --> 02:56:41.857
PART OF THE TO JUST ELEVATE THE

02:56:41.924 --> 02:56:43.559
POINT THAT YOU'RE JUST MAKING,

02:56:43.626 --> 02:56:45.661
THERE ARE MANY DATA GAPS AND

02:56:45.728 --> 02:56:47.229
ANALYTICAL GAPS AS WE MOVE

02:56:47.296 --> 02:56:48.931
FORWARD. I THINK, AGAIN, TO

02:56:48.998 --> 02:56:50.800
SHARE A PETRIE-NORRIS POINT

02:56:50.866 --> 02:56:54.003
EARLY ON. YOU KNOW, WE WE ARE

02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.837
KIND OF TRYING TO REACT TO A

02:56:54.904 --> 02:56:57.006
CRISIS. AND, YOU KNOW, IT WILL

02:56:57.073 --> 02:56:58.607
BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:56:58.674 --> 02:56:59.809
PROACTIVELY THINK ABOUT THE

02:56:59.875 --> 02:57:01.944
ANALYSIS, DATA AND POTENTIAL

02:57:02.011 --> 02:57:03.779
MEASURES WE NEED TO TAKE AS A

02:57:03.846 --> 02:57:05.414
STATE TO STABILIZE THIS OVER

02:57:05.481 --> 02:57:06.515
TIME PROACTIVELY. AND I THINK

02:57:06.582 --> 02:57:07.850
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST

02:57:07.917 --> 02:57:08.884
IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE

02:57:08.951 --> 02:57:09.852
LEGISLATION FOR THE LAST COUPLE

02:57:09.919 --> 02:57:11.654
OF YEARS IS PROVIDING THE

02:57:11.721 --> 02:57:13.823
ACTIVE DATA THAT YOU NEED TO TO

02:57:13.889 --> 02:57:15.024
MITIGATE THESE ISSUES AND TO

02:57:15.091 --> 02:57:16.625
WORK THROUGH THEM WITH INDUSTRY

02:57:16.692 --> 02:57:17.793
AND HAVE A PARTNERSHIP TO

02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:19.295
DEVELOP A SOLUTION. WITHOUT

02:57:19.362 --> 02:57:21.063
THOSE TOOLS, WE WOULD BE FLYING

02:57:21.130 --> 02:57:21.797
BLIND COMPLETELY IN THIS

02:57:21.864 --> 02:57:23.799
SITUATION AND MAY VERY WELL

02:57:23.866 --> 02:57:25.167
NEED A LOT MORE OF THOSE KIND

02:57:25.234 --> 02:57:27.169
OF TRANSPARENCY TOOLS TO BE

02:57:27.236 --> 02:57:29.038
EFFECTIVE. I CANNOT THANK THE

02:57:29.105 --> 02:57:30.840
LEGISLATURE ENOUGH FOR THE

02:57:30.906 --> 02:57:32.808
TOOLS THAT WERE GIVEN. AND I

02:57:32.875 --> 02:57:34.110
THINK THREE YEARS AGO WHEN YOU

02:57:34.176 --> 02:57:36.078
ASKED US THESE QUESTIONS, WE

02:57:36.145 --> 02:57:36.979
HAD NO ANSWERS. I THINK WE HAVE

02:57:37.046 --> 02:57:39.081
A LOT MORE DAYLIGHT INTO THE

02:57:39.148 --> 02:57:40.149
SITUATION, BUT WE'LL BE BETTER

02:57:40.216 --> 02:57:41.017
SERVED WITH MORE INFORMATION.

02:57:41.083 --> 02:57:43.285
AND THEN COMPLETELY UNRELATED,

02:57:43.352 --> 02:57:43.919
MISS RANDOLPH, YOU SPOKE AT THE

02:57:43.986 --> 02:57:45.721
BEGINNING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT

02:57:45.788 --> 02:57:47.523
OF SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS,

02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:49.692
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY

02:57:49.759 --> 02:57:51.660
FOR PRODUCTION OF CARBON. AND

02:57:51.727 --> 02:57:53.696
COULD YOU TALK MORE ABOUT HOW

02:57:53.763 --> 02:57:55.031
THAT WORKS? EXACTLY. THAT WAS A

02:57:55.097 --> 02:57:56.999
POINT THAT JUST KIND OF CAME

02:57:57.066 --> 02:57:58.367
AND WENT, AND I THINK PEOPLE

02:57:58.434 --> 02:57:59.702
WOULD BENEFIT FROM

02:57:59.769 --> 02:58:03.072
UNDERSTANDING IT BETTER. YES,

02:58:03.139 --> 02:58:06.709
BECAUSE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY

02:58:06.776 --> 02:58:13.249
FOR THE. WE HAVE REFINERIES

02:58:13.315 --> 02:58:14.383
THAT HAVE CONVERTED TO

02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:15.651
RENEWABLE DIESEL AND

02:58:15.718 --> 02:58:20.356
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL, AND

02:58:20.423 --> 02:58:23.426
THEN THAT ALLOWS FOR OTHER

02:58:23.492 --> 02:58:25.694
FACILITIES TO PRODUCE THE JET

02:58:25.761 --> 02:58:27.363
FUEL THAT'S NEEDED. AND IT

02:58:27.430 --> 02:58:31.834
REDUCES THE THE LET ME BACK UP,

02:58:31.901 --> 02:58:34.737
IT REDUCES THE NEED FOR THE

02:58:34.804 --> 02:58:36.939
FOSSIL REFINERIES TO PRODUCE

02:58:37.006 --> 02:58:41.444
FOSSIL JET FUEL. AND AND IT

02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:44.213
WILL HELP SUPPLEMENT THE SUPPLY

02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:46.749
OF JET FUEL AND THEN ALLOW FOR

02:58:46.816 --> 02:58:48.751
MORE PRODUCTION OF GASOLINE

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:49.618
FROM OTHER FACILITIES. THANK

02:58:49.685 --> 02:58:53.522
YOU. APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU,

02:58:53.589 --> 02:58:55.691
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARABEDIAN.

02:58:55.758 --> 02:58:57.059
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK

02:58:57.126 --> 02:58:58.894
YOU TO THE PANEL. WE'LL GO

02:58:58.961 --> 02:58:59.795
QUICK BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE

02:58:59.862 --> 02:59:02.164
TIRED AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE

02:59:02.231 --> 02:59:02.965
CROWD IS SLEEPY AS WELL. AND WE

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:04.800
HAVE A WHOLE NOTHER PANEL. BUT

02:59:04.867 --> 02:59:05.935
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

02:59:06.001 --> 02:59:07.036
THERE'S A THERE'S AN IMBALANCE

02:59:07.103 --> 02:59:07.770
BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. AND

02:59:07.837 --> 02:59:09.672
I THINK WHAT'S CONFUSING TO ME

02:59:09.738 --> 02:59:12.141
IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA DEMAND,

02:59:12.208 --> 02:59:13.809
WE INCLUDE EXPORTS TO NEVADA

02:59:13.876 --> 02:59:17.113
AND ARIZONA. WHY? WHY IS

02:59:17.179 --> 02:59:18.180
CALIFORNIA DEMAND, INCLUDING

02:59:18.247 --> 02:59:19.849
EXPORTS TO TWO OTHER STATES

02:59:19.915 --> 02:59:22.885
THAT DO NOT ADHERE TO THE SAME

02:59:22.952 --> 02:59:24.753
VALUES? I WOULD SAY FROM AN

02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:26.655
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY STANDPOINT,

02:59:26.722 --> 02:59:29.391
AS WE DO. AND WHY AREN'T THE

02:59:29.458 --> 02:59:31.894
NUMBERS ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA

02:59:31.961 --> 02:59:34.563
DEMAND? THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:59:34.630 --> 02:59:37.666
MEMBER. TWO POINTS THERE JUST

02:59:37.733 --> 02:59:40.102
30,000 FOOT LEVEL, ALMOST 90

02:59:40.169 --> 02:59:41.804
PLUS PERCENT OF NEVADA'S

02:59:41.871 --> 02:59:43.506
GASOLINE COMES FROM CALIFORNIA

02:59:43.572 --> 02:59:46.075
REFINERIES. THAT'S A HISTORICAL

02:59:46.142 --> 02:59:47.309
PRECEDENT. AND SIMILARLY FOR

02:59:47.376 --> 02:59:50.646
ARIZONA, IT'S ABOUT 50%. AND AS

02:59:50.713 --> 02:59:51.981
WE ARE TRANSITIONING AWAY, BOTH

02:59:52.047 --> 02:59:53.816
THOSE STATES HAVE INDICATED TO

02:59:53.883 --> 02:59:55.084
US IN OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT

02:59:55.151 --> 02:59:55.918
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

02:59:55.985 --> 02:59:57.653
ALTERNATIVES. AND I THINK PART

02:59:57.720 --> 02:59:58.888
OF THE DISCUSSION IN THE PAST

02:59:58.954 --> 03:00:01.457
WAS AROUND THOSE EXPORTS. AND I

03:00:01.524 --> 03:00:02.324
WANT TO POINT SPECIFICALLY TWO

03:00:02.391 --> 03:00:05.227
PIECES. ONE, JUST THE

03:00:05.294 --> 03:00:05.895
INTERSTATE COMMERCE. AND I

03:00:05.961 --> 03:00:09.031
DON'T THINK WE CAN DICTATE WHAT

03:00:09.098 --> 03:00:11.000
THE INDUSTRY HAS TO DO TO

03:00:11.066 --> 03:00:13.068
ENSURE THE SUPPLY AND JUST

03:00:13.135 --> 03:00:14.670
BEING GOOD NEIGHBORS IN TERMS

03:00:14.737 --> 03:00:16.605
OF MAKING SURE THE SUPPLY IS

03:00:16.672 --> 03:00:18.974
MET TO CURRENTLY, THE PRODUCT

03:00:19.041 --> 03:00:20.976
THAT LEAVES CALIFORNIA IS

03:00:21.043 --> 03:00:22.811
TYPICALLY THE LOW QUALITY

03:00:22.878 --> 03:00:23.979
PRODUCT THAT CANNOT BE USED IN

03:00:24.046 --> 03:00:26.782
CALIFORNIA. SO AS A PART OF THE

03:00:26.849 --> 03:00:27.917
REFINING PROCESS, YOU WILL

03:00:27.983 --> 03:00:29.785
ALWAYS HAVE SOME MOLECULES THAT

03:00:29.852 --> 03:00:31.820
DO NOT MEET CALIFORNIA SPEC.

03:00:31.887 --> 03:00:33.556
AND USUALLY THOSE GO TO NEVADA,

03:00:33.622 --> 03:00:35.691
ARIZONA, BUT ALSO SOUTH AMERICA.

03:00:35.758 --> 03:00:37.927
AND THE SOUTH AMERICA PART IS

03:00:37.993 --> 03:00:38.661
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. AND

03:00:38.727 --> 03:00:39.695
USUALLY THE FIRST STEP THE

03:00:39.762 --> 03:00:41.830
REFINERIES TAKE IN SERVING US

03:00:41.897 --> 03:00:45.334
IS TO CUT THAT OUT. AND TO THE

03:00:45.401 --> 03:00:45.968
EXTENT THAT THEY CAN MANAGE THE

03:00:46.035 --> 03:00:47.203
FLOWS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA,

03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:49.104
THEY DO THAT TO TODAY. VERY

03:00:49.171 --> 03:00:51.540
HELPFUL. SO IN ALL OF THE

03:00:51.607 --> 03:00:53.509
CHARTS IN YOUR PRESENTATION,

03:00:53.576 --> 03:00:54.944
WHERE YOU SHOW AN IMBALANCE OF

03:00:55.010 --> 03:00:56.579
SUPPLY AND DEMAND, WHAT

03:00:56.645 --> 03:00:58.414
PERCENTAGE OF DEMAND THAT'S NOT

03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:00.282
BEING MET IS ACTUALLY NEVADA

03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:04.086
AND ARIZONA, ROUGHLY 10%. OKAY.

03:01:04.153 --> 03:01:06.021
SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL. SO I

03:01:06.088 --> 03:01:07.756
THINK GOING FORWARD, WE NEED TO

03:01:07.823 --> 03:01:09.024
MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR, BECAUSE I

03:01:09.091 --> 03:01:10.793
THINK THAT THIS ISN'T EXACTLY

03:01:10.859 --> 03:01:12.761
HONEST ABOUT WHERE CALIFORNIA

03:01:12.828 --> 03:01:14.563
DEMAND IS AND WHERE CALIFORNIA

03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:15.965
SUPPLY IS. BEING A GOOD

03:01:16.031 --> 03:01:18.500
NEIGHBOR IS FINE. I DON'T THINK

03:01:18.567 --> 03:01:20.002
CALIFORNIANS SHOULD PAY, AND WE

03:01:20.069 --> 03:01:22.238
SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING AT SUCH A

03:01:22.304 --> 03:01:23.639
SPRINT OF A PACE TO FIGURE OUT

03:01:23.706 --> 03:01:25.941
A PROBLEM WHERE WE'RE WE'RE

03:01:26.008 --> 03:01:28.744
SUPPLEMENTING TWO OTHER STATES,

03:01:28.811 --> 03:01:29.845
AND I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A

03:01:29.912 --> 03:01:31.814
LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DO THAT. IT

03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:32.781
MIGHT BE JUST A HISTORIC

03:01:32.848 --> 03:01:33.849
PRECEDENT, BUT I THINK THAT'S

03:01:33.916 --> 03:01:35.484
SOMETHING, FRANKLY, THAT WE

03:01:35.551 --> 03:01:36.719
SHOULD CONSIDER. IF 10% OF THE

03:01:36.785 --> 03:01:38.988
DEMAND IS GOING TO TWO OTHER

03:01:39.054 --> 03:01:40.522
STATES THAT, AGAIN, HAVE NOT

03:01:40.589 --> 03:01:41.790
PUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND

03:01:41.857 --> 03:01:42.925
EFFORT INTO ACTUAL

03:01:42.992 --> 03:01:44.093
SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES LIKE WE

03:01:44.159 --> 03:01:45.561
HAVE, I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

03:01:45.628 --> 03:01:48.030
WE NEED TO DISCUSS. SO I DO

03:01:48.097 --> 03:01:48.931
THINK GOING FORWARD, WE SHOULD

03:01:48.998 --> 03:01:50.666
TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT THAT

03:01:50.733 --> 03:01:51.767
SOLUTION WOULD LOOK LIKE TO

03:01:51.834 --> 03:01:53.168
ACTUALLY HAVE CALIFORNIA TAKE

03:01:53.235 --> 03:01:55.638
CARE OF CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN

03:01:55.704 --> 03:01:57.206
CALIFORNIA DEMAND ACTUALLY

03:01:57.273 --> 03:01:58.607
BEING CALIFORNIA, NEVADA AND

03:01:58.674 --> 03:02:02.411
ARIZONA. AND THEN FINALLY,

03:02:02.478 --> 03:02:05.414
BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE NO TIME.

03:02:05.481 --> 03:02:07.082
THIS THIS PRESENTATION, THE

03:02:07.149 --> 03:02:08.717
WHOLE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN

03:02:08.784 --> 03:02:11.620
REALLY DETACHED FROM ECONOMICS.

03:02:11.687 --> 03:02:13.689
YOU CAN SEE TWO DIFFERENT AXES.

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:16.125
THE MOST ECONOMIC EFFICIENT WAY

03:02:16.191 --> 03:02:17.092
OF HANDLING THIS, AND THE MOST

03:02:17.159 --> 03:02:18.794
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY OF

03:02:18.861 --> 03:02:20.562
HANDLING THIS. WE VERY MUCH

03:02:20.629 --> 03:02:23.399
RELY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:02:23.465 --> 03:02:25.934
ASPECTS, WHICH I CAN VERY MUCH

03:02:26.001 --> 03:02:27.736
APPRECIATE. HOWEVER, WE NEED TO

03:02:27.803 --> 03:02:28.937
OBVIOUSLY BALANCE THIS, AND I

03:02:29.004 --> 03:02:30.639
THINK IF THIS IS A SHORT TERM

03:02:30.706 --> 03:02:31.774
EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:32.975
GET THROUGH AGAIN, PUTTING

03:02:33.042 --> 03:02:34.610
NEVADA AND ARIZONA ASIDE, WHAT

03:02:34.677 --> 03:02:36.812
WOULD JUST BE THE MOST

03:02:36.879 --> 03:02:37.780
ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT WAY OF

03:02:37.846 --> 03:02:39.615
DOING THIS? WOULD IT BE IT

03:02:39.682 --> 03:02:41.984
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE

03:02:42.051 --> 03:02:44.153
IMPORTING IMPORTING ALREADY

03:02:44.219 --> 03:02:45.721
REFINED GASOLINE. IT WOULD SEEM

03:02:45.788 --> 03:02:48.424
LIKE IT WOULD BE ACTUALLY JUST

03:02:48.490 --> 03:02:50.793
PRODUCING CRUDE HERE. RIGHT?

03:02:50.859 --> 03:02:52.594
DRILLING AND ACTUALLY PRODUCING

03:02:52.661 --> 03:02:55.030
IT HERE AND AND DOING

03:02:55.097 --> 03:02:55.931
EVERYTHING IN-HOUSE. WHAT IS

03:02:55.998 --> 03:02:57.399
YOUR ANSWER THOUGH TO THAT?

03:02:57.466 --> 03:02:59.234
WHICH AGAIN, IS IN HERE, WHAT'S

03:02:59.301 --> 03:03:01.070
THE MOST ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT

03:03:01.136 --> 03:03:02.237
WAY OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM.

03:03:02.304 --> 03:03:05.140
AND THEN I'M DONE. THANK YOU.

03:03:05.207 --> 03:03:05.674
YEAH. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:03:05.741 --> 03:03:07.743
MEMBER. JUST NOTING THE DATA

03:03:07.810 --> 03:03:10.279
POINTS WE HAVE TODAY, THE CRUDE

03:03:10.346 --> 03:03:11.680
OIL, THE INCREMENTAL COST, THE

03:03:11.747 --> 03:03:13.916
DELTA FOR CRUDE OIL ACQUISITION

03:03:13.982 --> 03:03:15.484
THROUGH IMPORTS IS

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:17.119
APPROXIMATELY 5 TO $0.10 HIGHER.

03:03:17.186 --> 03:03:19.488
AND THAT'S JUST JUST A DATA

03:03:19.555 --> 03:03:21.824
POINT. SO REFINERIES WHO HAVE

03:03:21.890 --> 03:03:23.759
TO WHO CANNOT ABSORB THAT ARE

03:03:23.826 --> 03:03:26.762
AT RISK OF REFINERY CLOSURES.

03:03:26.829 --> 03:03:29.665
SO I THINK JUST ON COST, THE

03:03:29.732 --> 03:03:30.933
CRUDE OIL FROM CALIFORNIA SEEMS

03:03:30.999 --> 03:03:33.535
TO BE A GOOD, GOOD INDICATOR.

03:03:33.602 --> 03:03:35.704
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK

03:03:35.771 --> 03:03:36.905
GIVEN THE OVERALL THROUGHPUT, I

03:03:36.972 --> 03:03:38.607
THINK ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE

03:03:38.674 --> 03:03:41.877
DO NOT WANT TO LOSE IN THIS

03:03:41.944 --> 03:03:43.178
CONVERSATION IS THE DECLINE OF

03:03:43.245 --> 03:03:44.747
CALIFORNIA. CRUDE OVER TIME IS

03:03:44.813 --> 03:03:47.983
NOT ONLY A LITIGATION, IT'S

03:03:48.050 --> 03:03:49.818
ALSO ECONOMICS. SOMETIMES, YOU

03:03:49.885 --> 03:03:52.121
KNOW, THESE THESE COMPANIES

03:03:52.187 --> 03:03:53.922
PRODUCE OR NOT BASED ON THE

03:03:53.989 --> 03:03:56.058
GLOBAL CRUDE OIL INDEXES. AND

03:03:56.125 --> 03:03:57.626
TODAY THOSE INDICES ARE VERY

03:03:57.693 --> 03:04:00.229
LOW. SO THEY WOULD NOT BE A LOT

03:04:00.295 --> 03:04:00.796
OF INTEREST FOR CALIFORNIA

03:04:00.863 --> 03:04:03.031
COMPANIES TO PRODUCE THE CRUDE.

03:04:03.098 --> 03:04:04.299
AND IT'S CYCLICAL. BUT OVER

03:04:04.366 --> 03:04:06.835
TIME, IT DOES SEEM TO SUGGEST

03:04:06.902 --> 03:04:10.105
THAT CALIFORNIA CRUDE GENERALLY

03:04:10.172 --> 03:04:16.278
IS CHEAPER. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:04:16.345 --> 03:04:17.613
MEMBER ELLIS. MADAM CHAIR,

03:04:17.679 --> 03:04:21.083
THANKS. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS

03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:24.720
CHAIRWOMAN RANDOLPH. DUE TO AIR

03:04:24.787 --> 03:04:25.821
QUALITY REGULATIONS IN THE

03:04:25.888 --> 03:04:30.726
STATE, WE PRODUCE THE CLEANEST

03:04:30.793 --> 03:04:36.031
OIL IN THE WORLD. WE REFINE THE

03:04:36.098 --> 03:04:38.700
CLEANEST PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD.

03:04:38.767 --> 03:04:41.603
THEN WE BRING IN A MILLION

03:04:41.670 --> 03:04:45.874
BARRELS A DAY, IMPORTED CRUDE

03:04:45.941 --> 03:04:47.709
THAT THE SHIPS ARE BURNING

03:04:47.776 --> 03:04:48.744
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES.

03:04:48.811 --> 03:04:50.679
NUMBER SIX, FUEL OIL, WHICH

03:04:50.746 --> 03:04:52.714
PUTS OUT POLYNUCLEAR AROMATIC

03:04:52.781 --> 03:04:55.217
HYDROCARBONS, ANTHRACENE,

03:04:55.284 --> 03:04:56.718
BENZENE. AND THESE ARE

03:04:56.785 --> 03:04:57.986
POLLUTANTS BY EPA STANDARDS.

03:04:58.053 --> 03:05:00.689
AND FOR 3 OR 4 WEEKS AT A TIME,

03:05:00.756 --> 03:05:02.958
THEY'RE BRINGING THESE SHIPS IN

03:05:03.025 --> 03:05:03.692
AND WE'RE POLLUTING. THE

03:05:03.759 --> 03:05:05.427
ATMOSPHERE IN THE JET STREAM

03:05:05.494 --> 03:05:06.795
BRINGS IT RIGHT INTO CALIFORNIA.

03:05:06.862 --> 03:05:11.867
HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT? WE

03:05:11.934 --> 03:05:13.569
ADDRESS THAT THROUGH THE AT

03:05:13.635 --> 03:05:14.903
BIRTH REGULATION. AND THE GOAL

03:05:14.970 --> 03:05:16.638
OF THAT REGULATION IS TO REDUCE

03:05:16.705 --> 03:05:18.774
EMISSIONS FROM THOSE SHIPS. BUT

03:05:18.841 --> 03:05:21.543
DO WE REDUCE IT 20 MILES OUT

03:05:21.610 --> 03:05:23.679
WHEN THEY CONVERT OVER TO LOW

03:05:23.745 --> 03:05:26.181
SULFUR DIESEL, OR DO WE GET TO

03:05:26.248 --> 03:05:27.015
REGULATE THEM FROM POINT OF

03:05:27.082 --> 03:05:27.850
ORIGIN? I SEE WHAT YOU'RE

03:05:27.916 --> 03:05:31.520
SAYING. WE REGULATE THEM WHEN

03:05:31.587 --> 03:05:32.921
THEY COME INTO CALIFORNIA

03:05:32.988 --> 03:05:36.558
WATERS. WE DO HAVE SOME

03:05:36.625 --> 03:05:37.793
REGULATORY, YOU KNOW, LIMITED

03:05:37.860 --> 03:05:41.296
REGULATORY CONTROL AROUND FUELS.

03:05:41.363 --> 03:05:46.034
THE THE INTERNATIONAL ENTITY

03:05:46.101 --> 03:05:48.971
THAT REGULATES THAT IS THE IMO,

03:05:49.037 --> 03:05:50.038
THE INTERNATIONAL MARITIME

03:05:50.105 --> 03:05:52.107
ORGANIZATION. AND THEY HAVE

03:05:52.174 --> 03:05:54.643
MADE PROPOSALS TO REDUCE

03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:57.312
EMISSIONS FROM OCEAN GOING

03:05:57.379 --> 03:05:59.348
VESSELS. OKAY. THANK YOU. NEXT

03:05:59.414 --> 03:06:00.749
QUESTION. VALERO, ALONG WITH

03:06:00.816 --> 03:06:01.917
THE OTHER REFINERIES, HAVE

03:06:01.984 --> 03:06:03.519
SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

03:06:03.585 --> 03:06:07.523
DOLLARS. AND MR. GUNJA, IF YOU

03:06:07.589 --> 03:06:08.090
COULD ANSWER THIS, HOW DO WE

03:06:08.156 --> 03:06:11.927
ENSURE THAT REFORMULATED FUELS,

03:06:11.994 --> 03:06:14.796
WHEN THEY GET INTO THE US, ARE

03:06:14.863 --> 03:06:16.832
ACTUALLY REFORMULATED INTO OUR

03:06:16.899 --> 03:06:18.433
STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE? THESE

03:06:18.500 --> 03:06:19.034
REFINERIES SPEND HUNDREDS AND

03:06:19.101 --> 03:06:20.802
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

03:06:20.869 --> 03:06:22.704
TO IMPROVE THEIR FACILITIES.

03:06:22.771 --> 03:06:24.940
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I

03:06:25.007 --> 03:06:26.642
THINK TWO POINTS JUST ON THE,

03:06:26.708 --> 03:06:28.944
YOU KNOW, THE MECHANICS OF IT.

03:06:29.011 --> 03:06:30.612
AND A LOT OF THIS FUEL WHEN IT

03:06:30.679 --> 03:06:31.713
COMES INTO CALIFORNIA HAS TO BE

03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:33.882
FURTHER BLENDED. SO I THINK

03:06:33.949 --> 03:06:35.617
YOU'RE NOTING THAT IN TERMS OF

03:06:35.684 --> 03:06:36.952
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

03:06:37.019 --> 03:06:39.721
INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS TO

03:06:39.788 --> 03:06:41.857
YOUR POINT, I THINK IMPORTS DO

03:06:41.924 --> 03:06:43.525
NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME

03:06:43.592 --> 03:06:44.826
REGULATORY BURDEN AS IN-STATE.

03:06:44.893 --> 03:06:47.229
AND THAT THAT DOES PUT THE

03:06:47.296 --> 03:06:48.564
REFINERIES AT A DISADVANTAGE,

03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:49.097
IN-STATE REFINERIES AT A

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:50.799
DISADVANTAGE. AND I THINK

03:06:50.866 --> 03:06:52.000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

03:06:52.067 --> 03:06:53.569
TO CONTINUE TO THINK THROUGH.

03:06:53.635 --> 03:06:56.672
OKAY, MISS LUCCHESE, WE HAVE IN

03:06:56.738 --> 03:07:00.609
2024, THERE WERE 84 NEW WELLS

03:07:00.676 --> 03:07:03.478
DRILLED IN CALIFORNIA IN 4000

03:07:03.545 --> 03:07:04.546
PLUG IN, ABANDONED. CAN YOU

03:07:04.613 --> 03:07:06.682
ADDRESS THAT AND WHY? WE ONLY

03:07:06.748 --> 03:07:11.653
HAD 84 NEW WELLS. YEAH, THAT IS

03:07:11.720 --> 03:07:13.822
PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE IN

03:07:13.889 --> 03:07:15.557
THIS POSITION IN TERMS OF

03:07:15.624 --> 03:07:17.392
UPSTREAM PRODUCTION AND THE

03:07:17.459 --> 03:07:20.729
SIGNIFICANT DECLINE. THERE HAVE

03:07:20.796 --> 03:07:23.865
BEEN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

03:07:23.932 --> 03:07:27.636
SEQUA LAWSUITS THAT HAVE THEN

03:07:27.703 --> 03:07:30.706
RESULTED IN EITHER STAYS OF

03:07:30.772 --> 03:07:31.940
MEANING. NO PERMITS CAN BE

03:07:32.007 --> 03:07:34.509
ISSUED LIKE THE KERN COUNTY

03:07:34.576 --> 03:07:37.312
ORDINANCE OR JUST THROUGH

03:07:37.379 --> 03:07:40.515
ACTIVE LITIGATION. WE HAVE THE

03:07:40.582 --> 03:07:42.751
CAL GEM HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO

03:07:42.818 --> 03:07:45.520
MOVE THROUGH THE SEQUA PROCESS

03:07:45.587 --> 03:07:46.955
EFFICIENTLY AND WITH CERTAINTY

03:07:47.022 --> 03:07:49.825
AND RELIABILITY, AND SO THAT

03:07:49.891 --> 03:07:51.827
HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY REASON OF

03:07:51.893 --> 03:07:54.630
WHY PERMITS HAVE DECLINED. OKAY.

03:07:54.696 --> 03:07:56.331
THANK YOU. TWO MORE QUESTIONS

03:07:56.398 --> 03:07:58.533
ON THE TWO. FOR ONE, CAN YOU

03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:01.203
TELL ME, DID YOU TAKE INTO

03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:01.937
ACCOUNT THE SMALL OPERATORS

03:08:02.004 --> 03:08:04.773
THAT HAD FIVE WELLS, TEN WELLS?

03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:07.442
ISN'T IS THAT KIND OF A

03:08:07.509 --> 03:08:09.611
CATASTROPHIC BUSINESS PROPOSAL

03:08:09.678 --> 03:08:11.546
TO THEM? HAS THAT BEEN

03:08:11.613 --> 03:08:14.816
CONSIDERED? OUR INTENT WAS,

03:08:14.883 --> 03:08:17.586
AGAIN, TO TO TRY TO FIND THAT

03:08:17.653 --> 03:08:19.154
RIGHT BALANCE OF AGAIN BEING

03:08:19.221 --> 03:08:20.756
VERY TARGETED IN THE

03:08:20.822 --> 03:08:22.591
STABILIZATION GOAL WHILE ALSO

03:08:22.658 --> 03:08:25.627
ADVANCING OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY

03:08:25.694 --> 03:08:28.096
POLICIES? IS THERE A WAY TO

03:08:28.163 --> 03:08:28.930
DEVELOP A FORMULA THAT WOULD

03:08:28.997 --> 03:08:31.033
INCLUDE THOSE SMALL OPERATORS?

03:08:31.099 --> 03:08:33.101
I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THAT. WE'D

03:08:33.168 --> 03:08:34.670
HAVE TO FOLLOW UP. I'D LIKE TO

03:08:34.736 --> 03:08:35.971
CONSIDER IT. OKAY. NEXT THING

03:08:36.038 --> 03:08:39.107
WELL, STIMULATION. CAN I MAKE

03:08:39.174 --> 03:08:39.808
SURE THAT WELL STIMULATION IS

03:08:39.875 --> 03:08:41.710
NOT NECESSARILY CONSIDERED

03:08:41.777 --> 03:08:43.545
FRACKING? THERE ARE 100 200

03:08:43.612 --> 03:08:44.913
DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES. AND I

03:08:44.980 --> 03:08:46.748
JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT FOR

03:08:46.815 --> 03:08:50.686
EVERYONE TODAY THAT THAT WELL,

03:08:50.752 --> 03:08:51.687
STIMULATION IS NOT NECESSARILY

03:08:51.753 --> 03:08:56.024
FRACKING. THE THAT IS AN

03:08:56.091 --> 03:08:58.927
IMPORTANT NUANCE AND POINT. THE

03:08:58.994 --> 03:09:01.596
WELL STIMULATION BAN UNDER THE

03:09:01.663 --> 03:09:04.433
EXISTING REGULATIONS HAS A VERY

03:09:04.499 --> 03:09:05.934
SPECIFIC DEFINITION TO IT. OKAY.

03:09:06.001 --> 03:09:09.971
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

03:09:10.038 --> 03:09:13.942
MEMBER CALDERON. YES, THANK YOU,

03:09:14.009 --> 03:09:15.711
MADAM CHAIR, AND ALL THE CHAIRS

03:09:15.777 --> 03:09:17.879
FOR THIS WONDERFUL HEARING. AND

03:09:17.946 --> 03:09:19.648
THIS HAS BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE.

03:09:19.715 --> 03:09:20.816
GOOD INFORMATION. I KNOW WE'RE

03:09:20.882 --> 03:09:22.918
SHORT ON TIME, SO I'M JUST

03:09:22.984 --> 03:09:24.886
GOING TO JUMP RIGHT IN. HOW

03:09:24.953 --> 03:09:27.122
MUCH MORE SUPPLY WOULD WELL

03:09:27.189 --> 03:09:27.923
STIMULATION PRODUCED AND WHAT

03:09:27.989 --> 03:09:30.092
WOULD THERE BE AN EFFECT ON

03:09:30.158 --> 03:09:35.731
COST. SO THAT IS A VERY COMPLEX

03:09:35.797 --> 03:09:36.998
QUESTION TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW.

03:09:37.065 --> 03:09:38.567
AND I WOULD LIKE THE

03:09:38.633 --> 03:09:39.701
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO

03:09:39.768 --> 03:09:41.503
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT. I

03:09:41.570 --> 03:09:42.871
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I

03:09:42.938 --> 03:09:43.739
THINK WE'RE JUST IN THIS

03:09:43.805 --> 03:09:45.006
CRITICAL MOMENT. AND I THINK,

03:09:45.073 --> 03:09:47.175
YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

03:09:47.242 --> 03:09:48.677
CONSIDER ALL OUR OPTIONS. AND,

03:09:48.744 --> 03:09:51.246
YOU KNOW, CALIFORNIANS ARE

03:09:51.313 --> 03:09:54.082
COUNTING ON US TO HELP THEM

03:09:54.149 --> 03:09:56.918
ENSURE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD GAS.

03:09:56.985 --> 03:10:04.493
SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SORRY.

03:10:04.559 --> 03:10:06.928
THANK YOU. SORRY. MISS CALDERON,

03:10:06.995 --> 03:10:08.797
ARE YOU YOU'RE THAT WAS IT.

03:10:08.864 --> 03:10:12.033
OKAY, MR. GIBSON, THANK YOU

03:10:12.100 --> 03:10:13.902
VERY MUCH. AND THANK THE PANEL

03:10:13.969 --> 03:10:15.670
FOR BEING HERE, BEING, I GUESS,

03:10:15.737 --> 03:10:16.905
THE LAST PERSON. A LOT OF MY

03:10:16.972 --> 03:10:18.073
QUESTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

03:10:18.140 --> 03:10:19.741
ANSWERED. NOT SATISFACTORY, BUT

03:10:19.808 --> 03:10:21.743
ANSWERED JUST FOR THE SAKE OF

03:10:21.810 --> 03:10:24.079
TIME. BUT I JUST WANT TO JUST

03:10:24.146 --> 03:10:26.047
CLARIFY IN QUESTION. WE TALKED

03:10:26.114 --> 03:10:29.217
ABOUT THE AT BIRTH POLICY HERE.

03:10:29.284 --> 03:10:30.952
HOW DO YOU REGULATE CHINA WHEN

03:10:31.019 --> 03:10:33.121
THEY COME INTO SOME OF OUR

03:10:33.188 --> 03:10:36.258
PORTS? HOW DO YOU REGULATE

03:10:36.324 --> 03:10:38.360
THEIR SHIPS, THEIR VESSELS

03:10:38.426 --> 03:10:45.600
COMING IN? SO I THE REQUIREMENT

03:10:45.667 --> 03:10:48.503
IS FOR THE REFINERS WHO ARE

03:10:48.570 --> 03:10:49.638
BRINGING THE VESSELS IN TO

03:10:49.704 --> 03:10:51.640
COMPLY WITH THE REGULATION. BUT

03:10:51.706 --> 03:10:52.908
YOU RAISE A VERY IMPORTANT

03:10:52.974 --> 03:10:53.775
POINT THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED

03:10:53.842 --> 03:10:56.244
WITH THE OPERATORS, BECAUSE,

03:10:56.311 --> 03:10:57.979
FOR INSTANCE, SHORE POWER IS

03:10:58.046 --> 03:11:02.117
ONE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT

03:11:02.184 --> 03:11:04.719
THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DEPLOYED

03:11:04.786 --> 03:11:06.955
IN LONG BEACH. BUT NOT EVERY

03:11:07.022 --> 03:11:09.691
SHIP HAS SHORE POWER CAPABILITY,

03:11:09.758 --> 03:11:12.294
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY

03:11:12.360 --> 03:11:15.096
TO REQUIRE THE SHIPS COMING IN

03:11:15.163 --> 03:11:17.365
TO HAVE THE SHORE POWER

03:11:17.432 --> 03:11:18.867
CAPABILITY. AND, YOU KNOW, SO

03:11:18.934 --> 03:11:20.902
THESE ARE SOME OF THE THE

03:11:20.969 --> 03:11:24.105
CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE

03:11:24.172 --> 03:11:25.707
DISCUSSING. AS I MENTIONED, YOU

03:11:25.774 --> 03:11:29.211
KNOW, SEVERAL SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN

03:11:29.277 --> 03:11:31.680
APPROVED THAT ARE MEANT TO

03:11:31.746 --> 03:11:34.115
CAPTURE EMISSIONS FROM THE

03:11:34.182 --> 03:11:35.717
VESSELS THEMSELVES. THAT'S ALSO

03:11:35.784 --> 03:11:39.421
A COMPLIANCE OPTION. AND WE ARE

03:11:39.487 --> 03:11:41.189
CONTINUING TO DEVELOP THE THAT

03:11:41.256 --> 03:11:43.024
TECHNOLOGY. BUT YOU ARE CORRECT

03:11:43.091 --> 03:11:45.760
THAT WE CANNOT FULLY CONTROL

03:11:45.827 --> 03:11:47.429
WHAT THE SHIPS COMING IN WOULD

03:11:47.495 --> 03:11:48.763
BE CAPABLE OF. SO WE WILL HAVE

03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:51.066
SOME SHIPS COMING IN THAT WILL

03:11:51.132 --> 03:11:51.967
STILL HAVE THE EMISSIONS THAT

03:11:52.033 --> 03:11:53.735
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IN SOME

03:11:53.802 --> 03:11:57.072
OF OUR PORTS, CORRECT? CORRECT.

03:11:57.138 --> 03:11:58.773
WHICH IS THE THE PURPOSE OF THE

03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:00.876
REMEDIATION FUND. OKAY. SO WE

03:12:00.942 --> 03:12:05.146
WILL HAVE SOME AS I STATED TO

03:12:05.213 --> 03:12:09.251
MR. SILVA, GOING BACK TO YOUR

03:12:09.317 --> 03:12:10.685
INITIAL QUESTION, I THINK IT

03:12:10.752 --> 03:12:13.889
WAS ASKED THAT WE NEED PER YEAR

03:12:13.955 --> 03:12:15.991
BETWEEN 500 BARRELS TO 580.

03:12:16.057 --> 03:12:18.727
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT ESTIMATE?

03:12:18.793 --> 03:12:20.629
THAT'S HISTORIC. THAT'S THE

03:12:20.695 --> 03:12:23.198
CURRENT USAGE OF THE REFINERIES

03:12:23.265 --> 03:12:25.834
AND IS SO. SO THE CURRENT USAGE

03:12:25.901 --> 03:12:29.771
OF THE REFINERIES IS BETWEEN

03:12:29.838 --> 03:12:31.039
500 AND 580 MILLION BARRELS A

03:12:31.106 --> 03:12:33.008
YEAR. AND THAT'S WHAT WE

03:12:33.074 --> 03:12:34.676
CONSUME IN CALIFORNIA. AND

03:12:34.743 --> 03:12:36.878
BASED ON THE THAT'S IF EVEN IF

03:12:36.945 --> 03:12:38.446
WE DO LOSE ONE OF OUR

03:12:38.513 --> 03:12:39.814
REFINERIES, WE STILL NEED NÓ.

03:12:39.881 --> 03:12:41.917
IT WILL GO DOWN BY PERCENT. SO

03:12:41.983 --> 03:12:43.184
AS WE CONTINUE TO LOSE

03:12:43.251 --> 03:12:44.686
REFINERIES, THAT WILL GO DOWN.

03:12:44.753 --> 03:12:46.721
AND AS REMEMBER TO AN EARLIER

03:12:46.788 --> 03:12:48.924
CONVERSATION, THIS WILL REQUIRE

03:12:48.990 --> 03:12:50.692
US TO ACTIVELY TRACK, YOU KNOW,

03:12:50.759 --> 03:12:52.928
AS THE REFINERIES GO DOWN,

03:12:52.994 --> 03:12:53.662
WHETHER THAT ADDITIONAL CRUDE

03:12:53.728 --> 03:12:55.931
OIL WILL BE USEFUL OR NOT. AND

03:12:55.997 --> 03:12:58.199
IF WE'RE READY FOR A RETIREMENT

03:12:58.266 --> 03:12:59.768
OF A CERTAIN PIPELINE. BUT

03:12:59.834 --> 03:13:01.503
TODAY'S SNAPSHOT IS, IS WHAT WE

03:13:01.569 --> 03:13:04.072
SHARED. JUST ONE FINAL POINT.

03:13:04.139 --> 03:13:06.908
WHAT ARE WE DOING BECAUSE OF

03:13:06.975 --> 03:13:08.643
VALERO, IN FACT CLOSES ITS

03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:10.045
DOORS? WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT

03:13:10.111 --> 03:13:12.647
THE JOB LOSS? HOW ARE WE WHAT

03:13:12.714 --> 03:13:13.949
ARE WE DOING ABOUT THAT?

03:13:14.015 --> 03:13:16.685
BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT I KNOW

03:13:16.751 --> 03:13:19.688
YOU SAID YOU PUT A PLAN. YOU

03:13:19.754 --> 03:13:21.623
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

03:13:21.690 --> 03:13:23.992
RIGHT. AND HOPEFULLY THAT IS TO

03:13:24.059 --> 03:13:25.694
THE SATISFACTORY. WE DON'T LOSE

03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:28.463
THAT THAT WILL HIT THAT CITY.

03:13:28.530 --> 03:13:31.766
LOSING $12 MILLION AS THE MAYOR

03:13:31.833 --> 03:13:32.934
HAD ALREADY INDICATED. RIGHT.

03:13:33.001 --> 03:13:34.703
AND WE HOPE THAT THAT DOESN'T

03:13:34.769 --> 03:13:37.005
HAPPEN. BUT WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT

03:13:37.072 --> 03:13:39.507
THE JOB LOSS AND THE TRANSITION?

03:13:39.574 --> 03:13:42.177
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:13:42.243 --> 03:13:42.777
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE LETTER.

03:13:42.844 --> 03:13:43.878
ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK THAT'S

03:13:43.945 --> 03:13:45.780
SOMETHING WE NEED TO HAVE A

03:13:45.847 --> 03:13:47.215
DISCUSSION AROUND HOW BEST TO

03:13:47.282 --> 03:13:49.050
PROTECT THE WORKFORCE. I THINK

03:13:49.117 --> 03:13:51.219
RIGHT NOW, FROM THE INPUT FROM

03:13:51.286 --> 03:13:52.721
THE LABOR COLLEAGUES, IS REALLY

03:13:52.787 --> 03:13:54.356
AROUND CREATING THOSE

03:13:54.422 --> 03:13:56.024
TRANSITION FUNDS TO ALLOW FOR

03:13:56.091 --> 03:13:57.993
RETRAINING AND ESTABLISHMENT OF

03:13:58.059 --> 03:14:00.662
NEW JOBS. IN THE LAST I'M JUST

03:14:00.729 --> 03:14:02.831
CURIOUS, 20 YEARS, HOW MANY

03:14:02.897 --> 03:14:04.399
REFINERIES DID WE HAVE IN

03:14:04.466 --> 03:14:05.734
CALIFORNIA AND HOW MANY DO WE

03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:07.902
HAVE NOW PRESENTLY? SO WE USED

03:14:07.969 --> 03:14:10.705
TO HAVE AT THE PEAK, WE USED TO

03:14:10.772 --> 03:14:11.940
HAVE ALMOST 40. WE HAD ALMOST

03:14:12.007 --> 03:14:13.775
40, ALMOST 40. BUT I THINK, YOU

03:14:13.842 --> 03:14:16.011
KNOW, AS WE DISCUSSED IN THE

03:14:16.077 --> 03:14:17.979
PAST, JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:14:18.046 --> 03:14:19.614
THAT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT

03:14:19.681 --> 03:14:20.782
THE OVERALL REFINING CAPACITY,

03:14:20.849 --> 03:14:22.584
SOME OF THEM WERE VERY SMALL

03:14:22.650 --> 03:14:24.519
AND OVER TIME THEY WERE

03:14:24.586 --> 03:14:26.254
CONSOLIDATED. SO EVEN, FOR

03:14:26.321 --> 03:14:27.322
EXAMPLE, WHEN WE LOOK AT

03:14:27.389 --> 03:14:28.923
MARATHON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:30.792
IT IS TWO REFINERIES COMBINED

03:14:30.859 --> 03:14:31.760
INTO ONE. SO THE NUMBERS DON'T

03:14:31.826 --> 03:14:34.896
ACCURATELY PREDICT THE OVERALL

03:14:34.963 --> 03:14:36.898
THROUGHPUT THROUGH REFINERIES.

03:14:36.965 --> 03:14:39.634
OKAY. AND ALSO YOU SAID THAT

03:14:39.701 --> 03:14:41.903
THE THE DEMAND HAS GONE DOWN.

03:14:41.970 --> 03:14:43.838
YES. AND WOULD YOU SAY WOULD

03:14:43.905 --> 03:14:45.974
YOU SAY THE DEMAND HAS GONE

03:14:46.041 --> 03:14:46.908
DOWN BECAUSE OF POLICIES THAT

03:14:46.975 --> 03:14:49.577
HAVE COME OUT OF. YEAH, I THINK,

03:14:49.644 --> 03:14:50.745
YOU KNOW, THAT HAVE LED TO

03:14:50.812 --> 03:14:52.847
DEMAND GOING DOWN? I THINK THE

03:14:52.914 --> 03:14:54.616
ADVENT OF NEW, NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

03:14:54.682 --> 03:14:55.750
AND I THINK THAT'S OUR

03:14:55.817 --> 03:14:56.785
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS IN THE

03:14:56.851 --> 03:14:57.752
STATE. AND I THINK IT'S

03:14:57.819 --> 03:15:00.121
IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW, WE LOOK TO

03:15:00.188 --> 03:15:01.222
THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS ON THIS

03:15:01.289 --> 03:15:02.991
DIALOG. I THINK CALIFORNIA IS

03:15:03.058 --> 03:15:03.625
COMMITTED TO THE CARBON

03:15:03.691 --> 03:15:04.826
NEUTRALITY POLICIES HAVE CAUSED

03:15:04.893 --> 03:15:06.961
THE DEMAND TO GO DOWN. I WOULD

03:15:07.028 --> 03:15:08.596
SAY THAT IT INCREASED THE

03:15:08.663 --> 03:15:09.731
DEMAND FOR ALTERNATIVES. AND

03:15:09.798 --> 03:15:11.433
ABSOLUTELY, THAT DRIVES THE

03:15:11.499 --> 03:15:12.734
DEMAND FOR FOSSIL. OKAY. AND I

03:15:12.801 --> 03:15:14.836
KNOW THAT I THINK THAT OUR

03:15:14.903 --> 03:15:17.238
CHAIR WAS TALKING ABOUT A LOT

03:15:17.305 --> 03:15:18.773
OF THE ELECTRIFICATION, BUT IF

03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:19.808
WE MOVE TO I THINK SHE WAS

03:15:19.874 --> 03:15:21.843
MOVING TOWARDS THIS DIRECTION

03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:22.811
WITH ELECTRIFICATION, BUT WE

03:15:22.877 --> 03:15:25.113
DON'T EVEN HAVE THE

03:15:25.180 --> 03:15:25.780
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

03:15:25.847 --> 03:15:26.648
ELECTRIFICATION THAT I THINK

03:15:26.714 --> 03:15:29.117
THAT THIS DIAGRAM WAS EVEN

03:15:29.184 --> 03:15:31.553
PROPOSING. BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR

03:15:31.619 --> 03:15:32.887
HER TO, IF SHE HAVE TIME TO

03:15:32.954 --> 03:15:35.590
FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF HER

03:15:35.657 --> 03:15:36.124
QUESTIONING, BECAUSE I WAS

03:15:36.191 --> 03:15:37.692
ABSOLUTELY FOLLOWING HER

03:15:37.759 --> 03:15:40.962
QUESTIONING CHAIR. WOULD YOU

03:15:41.029 --> 03:15:43.164
PLEASE, IF YOU HAVE TIME? YES,

03:15:43.231 --> 03:15:43.765
AND THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:15:43.832 --> 03:15:45.900
I YIELD BACK. YES. THANK YOU.

03:15:45.967 --> 03:15:47.969
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TURN

03:15:48.036 --> 03:15:50.004
IT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MACEDO

03:15:50.071 --> 03:15:50.972
AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA

03:15:51.039 --> 03:15:53.174
FOR THEIR QUESTIONS. AND THEN,

03:15:53.241 --> 03:15:55.110
YES, I WILL BE HAPPY TO EXPOUND

03:15:55.176 --> 03:15:56.277
ON THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING.

03:15:56.344 --> 03:15:58.713
OKAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER, LIKE AN

03:15:58.780 --> 03:16:00.048
ANNOYING FLY. YOU CAN'T GET RID

03:16:00.115 --> 03:16:01.683
OF IT. NO, NO, NO, I'M JUST

03:16:01.749 --> 03:16:02.917
KIDDING. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

03:16:02.984 --> 03:16:04.953
AND I'M REALLY BUMMED THAT WE

03:16:05.019 --> 03:16:05.753
DON'T HAVE MORE TIME BECAUSE I

03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:07.589
ACTUALLY WENT TO MR. ELLIS'S

03:16:07.655 --> 03:16:08.857
DISTRICT, AND I TOURED THE OIL

03:16:08.923 --> 03:16:10.592
FIELDS THERE, AND I ASKED THE

03:16:10.658 --> 03:16:12.727
QUESTIONS OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT,

03:16:12.794 --> 03:16:14.929
AND I WAS MET WITH OPTIMISM

03:16:14.996 --> 03:16:17.799
THAT WE HAVE A PATH FORWARD AND

03:16:17.866 --> 03:16:18.933
SOME CONCERN THAT ANY MINOR

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:20.969
THING CAN GET IN THE WAY OF

03:16:21.035 --> 03:16:22.704
THAT. SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN

03:16:22.770 --> 03:16:24.205
REALLY COME TOGETHER TO BE ALL

03:16:24.272 --> 03:16:26.107
HANDS ON DECK AND MOVE FORWARD,

03:16:26.174 --> 03:16:26.941
BECAUSE I KNOW CALIFORNIANS,

03:16:27.008 --> 03:16:27.842
CONSUMERS DON'T ULTIMATELY WANT

03:16:27.909 --> 03:16:29.744
TO PAY THE PRICE. SO I WON'T

03:16:29.811 --> 03:16:30.879
GET THROUGH ALL MY QUESTIONS

03:16:30.945 --> 03:16:31.880
TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE

03:16:31.946 --> 03:16:33.781
SHORT ON TIME. BUT I DO ASK

03:16:33.848 --> 03:16:35.717
THAT MAYBE WE CAN MEET OUTSIDE

03:16:35.783 --> 03:16:36.851
OF THIS TO HAVE MY QUESTIONS

03:16:36.918 --> 03:16:38.887
ANSWERED. SO MY FIRST ONE IS

03:16:38.953 --> 03:16:39.854
FOR MR. GUNDA. NICE TO SEE YOU

03:16:39.921 --> 03:16:41.823
AGAIN. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

03:16:41.890 --> 03:16:42.657
DEMAND FOR GASOLINE HAS GONE

03:16:42.724 --> 03:16:44.092
DOWN SLIGHTLY OVER THE PAST

03:16:44.159 --> 03:16:46.528
DECADE, BUT OTHER FUELS AND

03:16:46.594 --> 03:16:47.762
PRODUCTS MADE BY FOSSIL FUELS

03:16:47.829 --> 03:16:49.864
HAS ACTUALLY GONE UP, LIKE JET

03:16:49.931 --> 03:16:51.799
FUEL, FOR EXAMPLE. SO LOOKING

03:16:51.866 --> 03:16:54.369
AT THE PAST DECADE, HAS THE

03:16:54.435 --> 03:16:55.503
OVERALL ANNUAL CONSUMPTION OF

03:16:55.570 --> 03:16:56.838
FOSSIL FUELS IN CALIFORNIA GONE

03:16:56.905 --> 03:16:59.741
UP OR DOWN, OR HAS IT STAYED

03:16:59.807 --> 03:17:03.011
RELATIVELY STAGNANT? THANK YOU.

03:17:03.077 --> 03:17:04.746
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU,

03:17:04.812 --> 03:17:05.747
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, FOR THAT

03:17:05.813 --> 03:17:07.782
QUESTION. OVERALL, I THINK IT'S

03:17:07.849 --> 03:17:09.651
STILL IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT HAS

03:17:09.717 --> 03:17:11.619
GONE DOWN. BUT THE FUTURE

03:17:11.686 --> 03:17:13.955
PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT THE

03:17:14.022 --> 03:17:15.523
DEMAND FOR JET FUEL IS ACTUALLY

03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:17.825
GOING TO GO UP. SO THAT'S A

03:17:17.892 --> 03:17:19.427
CURRENT ANALYSIS WILL CONTINUE

03:17:19.494 --> 03:17:20.828
TO SEE A DECLINE IN THE USAGE

03:17:20.895 --> 03:17:22.964
FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES. BUT IN

03:17:23.031 --> 03:17:24.866
TERMS OF AVIATION FUEL WE'LL

03:17:24.933 --> 03:17:27.135
CONTINUE TO SEE AN UPTICK. SO

03:17:27.202 --> 03:17:29.804
ONE PROXY FOR US TO THINK ABOUT

03:17:29.871 --> 03:17:31.005
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE OVERALL

03:17:31.072 --> 03:17:32.674
DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE

03:17:32.740 --> 03:17:34.642
TO LOOK AT THE CRUDE OIL

03:17:34.709 --> 03:17:35.777
CONSUMPTION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

03:17:35.843 --> 03:17:37.579
CRUDE OIL CONSUMPTION LATE

03:17:37.645 --> 03:17:39.981
1980S TO TODAY, WHICH WHICH IS

03:17:40.048 --> 03:17:41.783
A PROXY FOR US TO SAY ALL THAT

03:17:41.849 --> 03:17:43.585
CRUDE OIL GOES THROUGH

03:17:43.651 --> 03:17:44.085
REFINERIES FOR PRODUCTS,

03:17:44.152 --> 03:17:45.553
WHATEVER THOSE PRODUCT SLATE

03:17:45.620 --> 03:17:47.522
MIGHT BE, THAT HAS GONE DOWN BY

03:17:47.589 --> 03:17:49.524
ABOUT 25%. SO WE HAVE THAT

03:17:49.591 --> 03:17:52.126
DECLINE TODAY. BUT AS WE MOVE

03:17:52.193 --> 03:17:53.995
FORWARD, IT COULD CONTINUE TO

03:17:54.062 --> 03:17:57.365
GROW IN CERTAIN AREAS. JUST TO

03:17:57.432 --> 03:17:59.968
PROVIDE A CONTEXT. WE USE ABOUT

03:18:00.034 --> 03:18:02.370
35 MILLION GALLONS A DAY TODAY

03:18:02.437 --> 03:18:04.639
OF GASOLINE. DIESEL IS ABOUT 8

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:07.308
MILLION GALLONS AND JET FUEL IS

03:18:07.375 --> 03:18:08.610
ABOUT HALF A MILLION GALLONS.

03:18:08.676 --> 03:18:09.877
RIGHT. SO THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS

03:18:09.944 --> 03:18:12.013
THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND THEY

03:18:12.080 --> 03:18:12.814
COULD CONTINUE TO CHANGE. BUT I

03:18:12.880 --> 03:18:14.749
WOULD I WOULD BASED ON THE

03:18:14.816 --> 03:18:16.050
NUMBERS I HAVE TODAY. AND WE

03:18:16.117 --> 03:18:18.019
WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. THE

03:18:18.086 --> 03:18:18.786
OVERALL DEMAND FOR FOSSIL HAS

03:18:18.853 --> 03:18:20.955
GONE DOWN. I WOULD LOVE TO MEET

03:18:21.022 --> 03:18:22.857
WITH YOU OFF THE DAIS,

03:18:22.924 --> 03:18:24.025
OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE THE DATA

03:18:24.092 --> 03:18:25.593
THAT I WAS SHOWN IS THAT

03:18:25.660 --> 03:18:27.161
ACTUALLY OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS

03:18:27.228 --> 03:18:28.830
IT STAYED RELATIVELY FLAT. SO

03:18:28.896 --> 03:18:30.064
ALTHOUGH WE'RE LOOKING AT

03:18:30.131 --> 03:18:31.766
GASOLINE CONSUMPTION GOING DOWN,

03:18:31.833 --> 03:18:34.068
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T

03:18:34.135 --> 03:18:34.802
EVEN REALIZE HOW MUCH OIL AND

03:18:34.869 --> 03:18:37.105
THINGS LIKE THAT GO INTO

03:18:37.171 --> 03:18:37.939
PRODUCTS THAT WE USE EVERY DAY.

03:18:38.006 --> 03:18:39.941
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

03:18:40.008 --> 03:18:40.842
WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT. MY

03:18:40.908 --> 03:18:43.044
NEXT QUESTION IS FOR MISS

03:18:43.111 --> 03:18:44.679
LUCCHESE. THANK YOU FOR BEING

03:18:44.746 --> 03:18:47.148
HERE. GAS PRICES ARE HIGH AND

03:18:47.215 --> 03:18:48.016
THEY IMPACT THE HIGH COST OF

03:18:48.082 --> 03:18:49.951
OUR EVERYDAY NECESSITIES. LIKE

03:18:50.018 --> 03:18:52.153
I JUST TALKED ABOUT. ARE YOU

03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:52.754
WORKING CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY

03:18:52.820 --> 03:18:54.822
TO TRY TO RESOLVE OUR SUPPLY

03:18:54.889 --> 03:18:56.958
CRISIS, OR WHAT ARE YOU DOING

03:18:57.025 --> 03:18:58.159
WITH INDUSTRY TO TRY TO MAKE

03:18:58.226 --> 03:18:59.894
SURE THEY'RE AT THE TABLE? YEAH.

03:18:59.961 --> 03:19:01.429
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.

03:19:01.496 --> 03:19:02.930
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

03:19:02.997 --> 03:19:05.166
ONE, ESPECIALLY IN OUR EFFORTS

03:19:05.233 --> 03:19:07.568
TO ENSURE THAT CALCIUM, IN

03:19:07.635 --> 03:19:08.636
PARTICULAR THEIR PERMITTING

03:19:08.703 --> 03:19:10.672
PROCESS IS BECOMES MORE

03:19:10.738 --> 03:19:12.573
PREDICTABLE AND CERTAIN AND

03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:14.842
RELIABLE. AND SO THAT WE ARE

03:19:14.909 --> 03:19:16.811
ACTIVELY WORKING WITH OPERATORS

03:19:16.878 --> 03:19:18.980
TO IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE PINCH

03:19:19.047 --> 03:19:21.649
POINTS ARE AND HOW WE CAN NOT.

03:19:21.716 --> 03:19:23.518
SO HOW WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THE

03:19:23.584 --> 03:19:25.053
PERMITTING PROCESS IN A

03:19:25.119 --> 03:19:26.888
PREDICTABLE WAY, TRYING TO

03:19:26.954 --> 03:19:28.956
ACHIEVE CERTAINTY OF PROCESS

03:19:29.023 --> 03:19:30.858
THAT WILL BE MUSIC TO THEIR

03:19:30.925 --> 03:19:32.927
EARS. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT

03:19:32.994 --> 03:19:34.595
WAS ON REPEAT DURING MY TOURS.

03:19:34.662 --> 03:19:36.864
BUT BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT IT UP.

03:19:36.931 --> 03:19:37.699
SO HOW LONG ARE PERMITS TO

03:19:37.765 --> 03:19:40.168
DRILLING NEW WELLS AND

03:19:40.234 --> 03:19:41.269
REWORKING EXISTING WELLS?

03:19:41.336 --> 03:19:43.237
TAKING TO GET APPROVED BY CAL

03:19:43.304 --> 03:19:46.874
CHEN CURRENTLY. NEW WELL

03:19:46.941 --> 03:19:50.144
PERMITS ARE TAKING A LOT LONGER,

03:19:50.211 --> 03:19:53.681
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF BUILDING

03:19:53.748 --> 03:19:58.086
OUT THE SEQUA COMPLIANCE AND

03:19:58.152 --> 03:19:59.187
ALSO BECAUSE, PARTICULARLY IN

03:19:59.253 --> 03:20:02.824
KERN COUNTY, THE COURTS HAVE

03:20:02.890 --> 03:20:04.025
STAYED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

03:20:04.092 --> 03:20:05.993
THAT ORDINANCE AND THAT HAS

03:20:06.060 --> 03:20:07.762
TRANSFERRED THE LEAD AGENCY

03:20:07.829 --> 03:20:10.965
ROLE TO CAL GEM. SO CEQA

03:20:11.032 --> 03:20:14.635
COMPLIANCE IS TAKING QUITE A

03:20:14.702 --> 03:20:17.538
LONG TIME AS PART OF THE

03:20:17.605 --> 03:20:20.241
PERMITTING PROCESS IN TERMS OF

03:20:20.308 --> 03:20:23.544
REWORKS AND OTHER PERMITS

03:20:23.611 --> 03:20:25.713
ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING WELLS.

03:20:25.780 --> 03:20:27.749
THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THERE HAS

03:20:27.815 --> 03:20:30.818
BEEN MORE PROGRESS MADE ON THE

03:20:30.885 --> 03:20:32.687
PREDICTABILITY OF THOSE PERMITS

03:20:32.754 --> 03:20:35.890
BEING PROCESSED. OKAY. DO WE

03:20:35.957 --> 03:20:37.992
CURRENTLY HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL

03:20:38.059 --> 03:20:39.861
IN-STATE CRUDE SUPPLIERS

03:20:39.927 --> 03:20:41.562
SUPPLIES THAT ARE READY TO COME

03:20:41.629 --> 03:20:43.898
ONLINE? RIGHT NOW, THE ONLY

03:20:43.965 --> 03:20:45.066
PIPELINE THAT CARRIES CRUDE

03:20:45.133 --> 03:20:46.768
FROM KERN COUNTY TO NORTHERN

03:20:46.834 --> 03:20:48.836
CALIFORNIA IS AT RISK. HAS

03:20:48.903 --> 03:20:49.971
ANYONE ASKED THAT PIPELINE

03:20:50.037 --> 03:20:52.140
OPERATOR WHAT THEY NEED TO

03:20:52.206 --> 03:20:54.475
CONTINUE OPERATING LONG TERM TO

03:20:54.542 --> 03:20:56.310
PREVENT A DIRE SITUATION IN

03:20:56.377 --> 03:20:58.646
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA? THANK YOU.

03:20:58.713 --> 03:20:59.947
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO THAT'S THE

03:21:00.014 --> 03:21:01.949
SAN PABLO CRIMSON LINE. THEY

03:21:02.016 --> 03:21:03.818
ARE CURRENTLY IN FRONT OF THE

03:21:03.885 --> 03:21:05.820
PUC ASKING FOR AN INCREASE IN

03:21:05.887 --> 03:21:08.022
RATES. SO THAT'S AN ACTIVE

03:21:08.089 --> 03:21:09.657
PROCEEDING. SO THAT'S ONE WAY

03:21:09.724 --> 03:21:11.025
THEY CAN STABILIZE THE PIPELINE.

03:21:11.092 --> 03:21:13.394
THE OTHER WAY THE OTHER ONE

03:21:13.461 --> 03:21:13.961
THROUGH THE FIRE MARSHAL'S

03:21:14.028 --> 03:21:16.330
OFFICE. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

03:21:16.397 --> 03:21:17.031
DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK THE

03:21:17.098 --> 03:21:18.032
INCREASED THROUGHPUT WILL

03:21:18.099 --> 03:21:20.301
DEFINITELY HELP. OKAY. DO I

03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:22.570
HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION?

03:21:22.637 --> 03:21:24.806
YES. AND THEN WE'LL DO THE

03:21:24.872 --> 03:21:26.908
RAPID FIRE ANSWER OF THAT ONE.

03:21:26.974 --> 03:21:29.010
MISS RANDOLPH IN CARBS SCOPING

03:21:29.076 --> 03:21:31.679
PLAN. IT STATED THAT POST 2045,

03:21:31.746 --> 03:21:34.015
EVEN IF THE STATE ACHIEVES

03:21:34.081 --> 03:21:35.850
CARBON NEUTRALITY, THE STATE

03:21:35.917 --> 03:21:37.018
AND ITS CITIZENS WILL STILL

03:21:37.084 --> 03:21:38.653
NEED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

03:21:38.719 --> 03:21:39.887
BARRELS A DAY OF FOSSIL FUELS

03:21:39.954 --> 03:21:42.056
FUELS. GIVEN THAT IN-STATE

03:21:42.123 --> 03:21:43.958
PRODUCERS CURRENTLY PRODUCE

03:21:44.025 --> 03:21:46.194
300,000 BARRELS A DAY, WHY DOES

03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:48.062
WHY DOES CARB HAVE A STATED

03:21:48.129 --> 03:21:50.665
GOAL TO SHUT IT DOWN, SHUT DOWN

03:21:50.731 --> 03:21:52.567
ALL IN-STATE PRODUCTION OF OIL

03:21:52.633 --> 03:21:55.002
BY 2045 DESPITE THIS FUTURE

03:21:55.069 --> 03:21:56.571
NEED, WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT

03:21:56.637 --> 03:21:57.839
CALIFORNIA WORKERS TO PRODUCE

03:21:57.905 --> 03:21:59.841
THIS ENERGY UNDER CALIFORNIA'S

03:21:59.907 --> 03:22:01.309
ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR LAWS,

03:22:01.375 --> 03:22:01.809
RATHER THAN BEING 100%

03:22:01.876 --> 03:22:04.745
DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN IMPORTS?

03:22:04.812 --> 03:22:06.681
SIMILAR TO WHAT MR. ELLIS HAD

03:22:06.747 --> 03:22:11.352
ASKED? WE DO NOT HAVE A GOAL TO

03:22:11.419 --> 03:22:13.120
SHUT DOWN PRODUCTION IN

03:22:13.187 --> 03:22:14.956
CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE THINGS

03:22:15.022 --> 03:22:16.991
WE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE SCOPING

03:22:17.058 --> 03:22:19.393
PLAN IS THAT AS WE ANTICIPATE

03:22:19.460 --> 03:22:22.763
DEMAND GOING DOWN, WE NEED TO

03:22:22.830 --> 03:22:24.832
ANALYZE THE QUESTION OF IS

03:22:24.899 --> 03:22:28.803
SUPPLY GOING DOWN ALONG WITH

03:22:28.870 --> 03:22:31.706
DEMAND? AND THAT THAT SECTION

03:22:31.772 --> 03:22:33.074
OF THE SCOPING PLAN WAS SORT OF

03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:34.675
WHAT LED TO THIS CONCEPT OF

03:22:34.742 --> 03:22:37.311
DOING A TRANSITION PLAN. BUT WE

03:22:37.378 --> 03:22:40.882
HAVE HAVE NEVER HAD A POLICY OF

03:22:40.948 --> 03:22:43.751
TURNING OFF SUPPLY WHEN THERE

03:22:43.818 --> 03:22:45.520
IS STILL DEMAND THAT'S

03:22:45.586 --> 03:22:48.656
NECESSARY. OKAY. AND THEN MY

03:22:48.723 --> 03:22:49.991
FINAL QUESTION, AND MR. GIBSON

03:22:50.057 --> 03:22:52.593
TOUCHED ON IT. SO I'M SURE MISS

03:22:52.660 --> 03:22:53.794
PETRIE-NORRIS WILL, BECAUSE I

03:22:53.861 --> 03:22:55.897
SHARE HER SAME CONCERNS THAT

03:22:55.963 --> 03:22:57.064
SHE MENTIONED AND THE

03:22:57.131 --> 03:22:58.799
SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE

03:22:58.866 --> 03:23:00.668
PROJECTIONS ON THE REDUCTION ON

03:23:00.735 --> 03:23:02.904
DEMAND. I THINK THEY'RE VERY

03:23:02.970 --> 03:23:04.572
UNREALISTIC. SO THERE'S KIND OF

03:23:04.639 --> 03:23:06.641
TWO PATHS HERE THAT I'M SEEING

03:23:06.707 --> 03:23:08.543
THAT EITHER YOU'RE SUGGESTING

03:23:08.609 --> 03:23:10.811
CALIFORNIANS WERE VOLUNTARILY,

03:23:10.878 --> 03:23:12.847
YOU KNOW, LOWER THEIR QUALITY

03:23:12.914 --> 03:23:14.682
OF LIFE OR WE WILL HAVE TO

03:23:14.749 --> 03:23:16.350
LEGISLATE THEM, FORCING IT TO

03:23:16.417 --> 03:23:18.519
HAPPEN. SO I DON'T BELIEVE MOST

03:23:18.586 --> 03:23:19.854
CALIFORNIANS WILL CHOOSE THIS

03:23:19.921 --> 03:23:22.490
PATH. AND IF WE AS LEGISLATORS

03:23:22.557 --> 03:23:23.624
IMPOSE THIS, THEY'RE GOING TO

03:23:23.691 --> 03:23:25.826
COME FOR US WITH PITCHFORKS. SO

03:23:25.893 --> 03:23:28.062
I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION.

03:23:28.129 --> 03:23:31.098
LIKE WHAT? WHAT'S THAT PATH

03:23:31.165 --> 03:23:32.600
FORWARD? BECAUSE PERSONALLY, I

03:23:32.667 --> 03:23:33.801
THINK WE SHOULD BE ADOPTING

03:23:33.868 --> 03:23:35.803
POLICIES THAT IT'S WHAT

03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:37.672
CALIFORNIANS WANT, NOT WHAT WE

03:23:37.738 --> 03:23:39.840
AS LEGISLATORS ARE TELLING

03:23:39.907 --> 03:23:41.008
CALIFORNIANS THEY SHOULD WANT.

03:23:41.075 --> 03:23:43.110
AND I'M SURE THIS IS GOING TO

03:23:43.177 --> 03:23:43.844
BE ADDRESSED WITH THE CONCERNS

03:23:43.911 --> 03:23:46.314
OF THE CHAIR. BUT IF YOU COULD

03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:48.115
TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT

03:23:48.182 --> 03:23:49.617
PATH FORWARD LOOKS LIKE? WE AS

03:23:49.684 --> 03:23:52.853
AN AGENCY ARE IMPLEMENTING THE

03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:54.021
STATUTORY GOALS THAT ARE SET

03:23:54.088 --> 03:23:57.158
FORTH BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO

03:23:57.224 --> 03:23:59.327
THAT INCLUDES CARBON NEUTRALITY

03:23:59.393 --> 03:24:01.796
BY 2045. IT INCLUDES SB 100

03:24:01.862 --> 03:24:05.299
100%, RETAIL SALES OF

03:24:05.366 --> 03:24:07.902
ELECTRICITY AND AND EACH OF THE

03:24:07.969 --> 03:24:09.070
ADDITIONAL PIECES OF

03:24:09.136 --> 03:24:10.771
LEGISLATION THAT I HIGHLIGHTED

03:24:10.838 --> 03:24:13.708
ON THAT EARLIER SLIDE. AS I

03:24:13.774 --> 03:24:16.877
NOTED, WE DO NOT HAVE A POLICY

03:24:16.944 --> 03:24:18.679
AT CARB TO SHUT OFF SUPPLY

03:24:18.746 --> 03:24:21.115
BEFORE DEMAND, BUT WE DO HAVE

03:24:21.182 --> 03:24:23.217
POLICIES THAT WILL ENCOURAGE

03:24:23.284 --> 03:24:24.852
ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY

03:24:24.919 --> 03:24:26.721
REDUCING THE DEMAND ON FOSSIL

03:24:26.787 --> 03:24:28.990
FUELS. OKAY, I HAVE SO MANY

03:24:29.056 --> 03:24:29.790
MORE QUESTIONS, BUT I LOOK

03:24:29.857 --> 03:24:31.759
FORWARD TO MEETING YOU ALL

03:24:31.826 --> 03:24:33.260
PRIVATELY. BUT THANK YOU ALL

03:24:33.327 --> 03:24:34.895
FOR BEING HERE. IT REALLY IS A

03:24:34.962 --> 03:24:35.763
VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. THANK YOU,

03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:37.331
MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU,

03:24:37.398 --> 03:24:38.065
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. THANK

03:24:38.132 --> 03:24:40.034
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU

03:24:40.101 --> 03:24:42.103
TO THE PANELISTS FOR FOR

03:24:42.169 --> 03:24:42.737
ANSWERING ALL OUR QUESTIONS. I

03:24:42.803 --> 03:24:45.139
ALSO HAVE A SUPPLY DEMAND

03:24:45.206 --> 03:24:46.807
QUESTION. AND FIRST OF ALL, I

03:24:46.874 --> 03:24:48.476
APPRECIATE VICE CHAIR GONDA FOR

03:24:48.542 --> 03:24:50.778
FOR SHARING THAT DEMAND FOR

03:24:50.845 --> 03:24:52.546
GASOLINE, PETROLEUM HAS GONE

03:24:52.613 --> 03:24:54.915
DOWN. AND AND THAT THE REASON

03:24:54.982 --> 03:24:57.084
FOR IT HAS BEEN THAT THERE ARE

03:24:57.151 --> 03:24:59.220
ALTERNATIVES. AND SO THAT'S

03:24:59.286 --> 03:25:00.788
RELATED TO MY QUESTION, BECAUSE

03:25:00.855 --> 03:25:02.156
I SEE ON THE PROJECTIONS HERE

03:25:02.223 --> 03:25:05.893
TO 2027 THAT THERE'S QUITE A

03:25:05.960 --> 03:25:07.595
PRECIPITOUS DROP IN REFINING

03:25:07.662 --> 03:25:09.764
CAPACITY, BUT NOT SO MUCH FOR

03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:11.632
GASOLINE DEMAND. SO I DO

03:25:11.699 --> 03:25:12.800
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S GOING DOWN,

03:25:12.867 --> 03:25:14.502
BUT NOT AS MUCH. AND SO I

03:25:14.568 --> 03:25:16.203
WANTED TO KNOW, DOES THIS TAKE

03:25:16.270 --> 03:25:19.407
INTO ACCOUNT KIND OF THE MARKET

03:25:19.473 --> 03:25:22.143
REACTION TO, TO HAVING REDUCED

03:25:22.209 --> 03:25:24.879
REDUCED DEMAND BUT STILL HAVING

03:25:24.945 --> 03:25:28.182
OR REDUCED DEMAND OR HIGH

03:25:28.249 --> 03:25:29.617
DEMAND BUT REDUCED SUPPLY. SO

03:25:29.684 --> 03:25:30.685
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING TO

03:25:30.751 --> 03:25:31.986
STABILIZE COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA

03:25:32.053 --> 03:25:34.188
CONSUMERS. SO THOSE PRICES GO

03:25:34.255 --> 03:25:35.690
UP. CALIFORNIANS DO HAVE

03:25:35.756 --> 03:25:38.125
ALTERNATIVES. THEY CAN GO TO

03:25:38.192 --> 03:25:39.760
HYBRID VEHICLES EVS. SO IS THAT

03:25:39.827 --> 03:25:41.429
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT INTO THE

03:25:41.495 --> 03:25:43.731
DEMAND PROJECTIONS. THANK YOU.

03:25:43.798 --> 03:25:45.833
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO TO CHAIR

03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:47.768
RANDOLPH'S POINT EARLIER. SO

03:25:47.835 --> 03:25:51.005
ONE OF THE WAYS TO WE FORECAST

03:25:51.072 --> 03:25:54.108
IS BASED ON A CONSUMER SURVEY

03:25:54.175 --> 03:25:54.909
THAT WE COLLECTIVELY DO EVERY

03:25:54.975 --> 03:25:56.911
THREE YEARS. AND THE CONSUMER

03:25:56.977 --> 03:25:59.580
SURVEY IS ABOUT GETTING THE

03:25:59.647 --> 03:26:02.450
PREFERENCES AND DRIVEN BY A

03:26:02.516 --> 03:26:03.818
VARIETY OF ATTRIBUTES, SUCH AS

03:26:03.884 --> 03:26:06.721
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO REFILL,

03:26:06.787 --> 03:26:08.589
WHAT'S THE COST OF IT, AND

03:26:08.656 --> 03:26:10.357
WHETHER IT HAS A PARITY WITH

03:26:10.424 --> 03:26:13.427
CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND SO ON.

03:26:13.494 --> 03:26:14.061
SO BASED ON ALL THOSE VARIABLES

03:26:14.128 --> 03:26:15.763
AND LOOKING AT HOW THOSE

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:17.098
VARIABLES ARE PROJECTED TO

03:26:17.164 --> 03:26:18.532
CHANGE, WE DEVELOP THE DEMAND

03:26:18.599 --> 03:26:20.768
FORECAST. SO TO YOUR POINT,

03:26:20.835 --> 03:26:22.703
IT'S IMPLICIT IN IT THE

03:26:22.770 --> 03:26:24.605
INCREASED COST AND THE CONSUMER

03:26:24.672 --> 03:26:26.107
BEHAVIOR BASED ON THAT COST

03:26:26.173 --> 03:26:27.775
OKAY. SO IT DOES TAKE IT INTO

03:26:27.842 --> 03:26:29.710
ACCOUNT ALREADY BECAUSE I DO

03:26:29.777 --> 03:26:31.412
KNOW THAT FOR THE LAST TWO

03:26:31.479 --> 03:26:32.580
YEARS, ROUGHLY 1 IN 4 VEHICLES

03:26:32.646 --> 03:26:34.815
ARE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND SO I

03:26:34.882 --> 03:26:36.617
IF WE DO STATUS QUO IS NOTHING

03:26:36.684 --> 03:26:37.818
THAT I DO EXPECT THAT TO

03:26:37.885 --> 03:26:39.720
INCREASE. AND LIKE WE'RE NOT IN

03:26:39.787 --> 03:26:41.155
THE 70S EMBARGO DAYS. AND SO WE

03:26:41.222 --> 03:26:42.757
DO HAVE ALTERNATIVES. NOW

03:26:42.823 --> 03:26:44.592
SECOND QUESTION, I KNOW BECAUSE

03:26:44.658 --> 03:26:46.560
THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US REALLY

03:26:46.627 --> 03:26:47.962
IS, YOU KNOW, HOW ARE WE GOING

03:26:48.028 --> 03:26:49.697
TO HELP AND INTERVENE. AND SO

03:26:49.764 --> 03:26:50.965
MY QUESTION, YOU KNOW, I GUESS

03:26:51.031 --> 03:26:52.867
TO EVERYBODY HERE IS, IS, IS

03:26:52.933 --> 03:26:54.135
WHAT IS PRECLUDING IF VALERO

03:26:54.201 --> 03:26:56.270
DOES NOT SEE IT ECONOMICALLY

03:26:56.337 --> 03:26:57.872
VIABLE TO STAY IN BENICIA, WHAT

03:26:57.938 --> 03:26:59.673
IS PRECLUDING THE STATE FROM

03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:02.143
FROM TAKING IT OVER AND KEEPING

03:27:02.209 --> 03:27:03.010
THOSE JOBS AND MAKING SURE WE

03:27:03.077 --> 03:27:11.051
CAN FILL THAT SHORTFALL? ANYONE?

03:27:11.118 --> 03:27:15.856
VICE CHAIR. I THINK SO. 30,000

03:27:15.923 --> 03:27:18.492
FOOT LEVEL ASSEMBLY MEMBER I

03:27:18.559 --> 03:27:20.060
THINK FROM FROM CCS PERSPECTIVE

03:27:20.127 --> 03:27:22.663
AND THE ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE,

03:27:22.730 --> 03:27:25.399
CONTINUING TO HAVE VALERO AS AN

03:27:25.466 --> 03:27:27.635
ASSET IN CALIFORNIA WOULD

03:27:27.701 --> 03:27:28.869
DEFINITELY HAVE RESILIENCY IN A

03:27:28.936 --> 03:27:31.672
POSITIVE WAY. WE ARE CURRENTLY

03:27:31.739 --> 03:27:32.907
SEEING THAT THE MARKET IS

03:27:32.973 --> 03:27:34.809
SOLVING FOR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

03:27:34.875 --> 03:27:36.644
SITUATION WHICH WE MIGHT SEE

03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:38.779
NEXT YEAR, WHICH IS HAVING ONLY

03:27:38.846 --> 03:27:40.214
TWO REFINERIES IN NORTHERN

03:27:40.281 --> 03:27:42.349
CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK, YOU

03:27:42.416 --> 03:27:43.717
KNOW, I WOULD YOU KNOW, BASED

03:27:43.784 --> 03:27:45.619
ON MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE, I

03:27:45.686 --> 03:27:46.954
WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE FIRST

03:27:47.021 --> 03:27:50.724
LOOK TO HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE THE

03:27:50.791 --> 03:27:52.259
PARTICIPATION OF THE MARKET TO

03:27:52.326 --> 03:27:53.828
ENSURE THAT. BUT HAVING SAID

03:27:53.894 --> 03:27:56.030
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE DISCUSSIONS

03:27:56.096 --> 03:27:57.097
WITH VALERO, AGAIN, I'M NOT AT

03:27:57.164 --> 03:27:59.300
LIBERTY TO DISCLOSE, GIVEN THE

03:27:59.366 --> 03:28:01.268
CONFIDENTIAL NATURE, YOU KNOW,

03:28:01.335 --> 03:28:02.303
CONTINUING VALERO THROUGH

03:28:02.369 --> 03:28:03.804
THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

03:28:03.871 --> 03:28:06.674
NOT STRAIGHT OUT TAKEN OVER,

03:28:06.740 --> 03:28:08.976
MIGHT BE MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR

03:28:09.043 --> 03:28:10.544
US TO CONSIDER. ALL RIGHT.

03:28:10.611 --> 03:28:12.646
THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT.

03:28:12.713 --> 03:28:14.315
THANK YOU. AND I JUST HAVE ONE

03:28:14.381 --> 03:28:18.018
FOLLOW UP QUESTION RELATED TO

03:28:18.085 --> 03:28:18.953
THE EPA'S REGULATIONS. AND I

03:28:19.019 --> 03:28:21.188
KNOW, CHAIR RANDOLPH, IN YOUR

03:28:21.255 --> 03:28:22.990
OPENING COMMENTS, YOU SPOKE A

03:28:23.057 --> 03:28:25.559
LITTLE BIT TO THOSE. AND VICE

03:28:25.626 --> 03:28:28.028
CHAIR GUNDA IN THE LETTER THAT

03:28:28.095 --> 03:28:30.231
YOU DRAFTED WITH YOUR

03:28:30.297 --> 03:28:31.765
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR.

03:28:31.832 --> 03:28:33.801
YOU DID MENTION THIS. I'M JUST

03:28:33.868 --> 03:28:34.935
GOING TO READ YOUR

03:28:35.002 --> 03:28:37.004
RECOMMENDATIONS. IT SAID, WE

03:28:37.071 --> 03:28:37.738
RECOMMEND THAT YOU REQUEST THAT

03:28:37.805 --> 03:28:38.906
CARB MEET WITH EACH REFINER AND

03:28:38.973 --> 03:28:41.175
TERMINAL COVERED BY THE AT

03:28:41.242 --> 03:28:41.775
BERTH REGULATION, AND DISCUSS

03:28:41.842 --> 03:28:42.610
CURRENT STATUS AND BARRIERS TO

03:28:42.676 --> 03:28:44.011
IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL TECHNICAL

03:28:44.078 --> 03:28:45.713
TOOLS INTENDED TO ACHIEVE

03:28:45.779 --> 03:28:46.847
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM

03:28:46.914 --> 03:28:49.250
TANKERS AT BERTH. TO ASSESS THE

03:28:49.316 --> 03:28:49.817
TIMELINES FOR DEPLOYMENT OF

03:28:49.884 --> 03:28:52.019
THOSE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.

03:28:52.086 --> 03:28:53.888
HAVE THOSE MEETINGS HAPPENED?

03:28:53.954 --> 03:28:55.956
ARE THEY GOING TO HAPPEN AND

03:28:56.023 --> 03:28:57.591
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

03:28:57.658 --> 03:29:01.662
RESULTED IN ANY SHIFT IN CARB

03:29:01.729 --> 03:29:05.232
REGULATION OR POLICY? WE ARE

03:29:05.299 --> 03:29:08.135
CURRENTLY IN ONGOING

03:29:08.202 --> 03:29:08.969
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

03:29:09.036 --> 03:29:13.040
COMPANIES AROUND AT BERTH. ALL

03:29:13.107 --> 03:29:15.676
RIGHT. AND AGAIN, I THINK

03:29:15.743 --> 03:29:17.511
THERE'S A LOT OF OF COMMITTEE

03:29:17.578 --> 03:29:20.114
MEMBERS WITH SOME FOLLOW UP

03:29:20.180 --> 03:29:22.683
QUESTIONS. THERE IS A LOT MORE

03:29:22.750 --> 03:29:25.152
FOR US TO DIG INTO. I THINK I

03:29:25.219 --> 03:29:27.054
MY PARTING OR CLOSING COMMENTS

03:29:27.121 --> 03:29:28.822
WOULD SIMPLY BE THAT I DO FEEL

03:29:28.889 --> 03:29:31.191
LIKE THE THE FUNDAMENTAL

03:29:31.258 --> 03:29:33.694
CHALLENGE BEFORE US IS THAT AS

03:29:33.761 --> 03:29:34.929
WE'RE A MANAGED TRANSITION

03:29:34.995 --> 03:29:38.832
MEANS THAT SUPPLY IS GOING DOWN

03:29:38.899 --> 03:29:42.002
AT A SIMILAR TRAJECTORY TO

03:29:42.069 --> 03:29:44.405
DEMAND. AT THE FOUNDATION OF

03:29:44.471 --> 03:29:46.640
THAT IS A ROBUST DEMAND

03:29:46.707 --> 03:29:50.711
FORECAST. AND I, I JUST COME

03:29:50.778 --> 03:29:51.979
AWAY FROM THIS THINKING THAT

03:29:52.046 --> 03:29:54.014
OUR TRANSPORTATION FUELS

03:29:54.081 --> 03:29:55.683
TRANSITION PLAN IS SO

03:29:55.749 --> 03:29:57.918
IMPORTANTLY MISSING AND SO

03:29:57.985 --> 03:29:59.687
FOUNDATIONAL AS WE THINK ABOUT

03:29:59.753 --> 03:30:00.988
MANAGING THIS IN AN EFFECTIVE

03:30:01.055 --> 03:30:03.824
WAY. I AND IT SOUNDS LIKE MANY

03:30:03.891 --> 03:30:05.893
OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO HAVE

03:30:05.960 --> 03:30:07.127
SOME PRETTY FOUNDATIONAL

03:30:07.194 --> 03:30:08.128
QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR CORE

03:30:08.195 --> 03:30:10.130
ASSUMPTIONS. I THINK WE

03:30:10.197 --> 03:30:12.166
CERTAINLY WANT TO BE AMBITIOUS

03:30:12.232 --> 03:30:14.802
WITH OUR GOALS, AMBITIOUS EVEN

03:30:14.868 --> 03:30:16.870
AS WE CRAFT POLICY. BUT WE'VE

03:30:16.937 --> 03:30:18.806
ALSO GOT TO BE REALISTIC AND

03:30:18.872 --> 03:30:20.207
CLEAR EYED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

03:30:20.274 --> 03:30:22.643
WE FACE. SO, AS WITH ANYTHING,

03:30:22.710 --> 03:30:24.645
HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY. SO WE

03:30:24.712 --> 03:30:27.681
GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BOTH,

03:30:27.748 --> 03:30:29.116
I THINK, COME AWAY FROM TODAY'S

03:30:29.183 --> 03:30:31.652
HEARING, AND I THINK WE HAVE,

03:30:31.719 --> 03:30:33.053
ARMED WITH THE INSIGHT AND

03:30:33.120 --> 03:30:35.055
KNOWLEDGE, TO TAKE SOME URGENT

03:30:35.122 --> 03:30:36.790
AND IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADDRESS

03:30:36.857 --> 03:30:38.492
THE NEAR-TERM CRISIS. BUT I

03:30:38.559 --> 03:30:39.793
THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK

03:30:39.860 --> 03:30:41.962
THAT WE ALL NEED TO DO TOGETHER

03:30:42.029 --> 03:30:44.031
IN ORDER TO BUILD A ROBUST,

03:30:44.098 --> 03:30:45.799
LONG TERM STRATEGY AND PLAN. SO

03:30:45.866 --> 03:30:47.901
WE'LL JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR

03:30:47.968 --> 03:30:48.769
YOUR SERVICE, FOR YOUR

03:30:48.836 --> 03:30:50.004
PARTNERSHIP AND YOUR LEADERSHIP

03:30:50.070 --> 03:30:52.773
ON THIS ISSUE AND LOOK FORWARD

03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:54.775
TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU

03:30:54.842 --> 03:30:56.877
TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE CRAFTING

03:30:56.944 --> 03:30:57.678
POLICY THAT MEETS THE NEED OF

03:30:57.745 --> 03:30:58.879
CALIFORNIA, AND MOST

03:30:58.946 --> 03:30:59.913
IMPORTANTLY, OF THE

03:30:59.980 --> 03:31:01.515
CALIFORNIANS THAT WE ALL

03:31:01.582 --> 03:31:02.649
REPRESENT AND WORK FOR. SO

03:31:02.716 --> 03:31:04.852
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK

03:31:04.918 --> 03:31:06.520
YOU SO MUCH. OKAY. AND WITH

03:31:06.587 --> 03:31:07.888
THAT WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE.

03:31:07.955 --> 03:31:09.890
THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAMINA AS

03:31:09.957 --> 03:31:10.858
WELL. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE MOVING

03:31:10.924 --> 03:31:14.862
NOW TO OUR SECOND PANEL WHERE

03:31:14.928 --> 03:31:18.298
WE WILL BE JOINED BY JEREMY.

03:31:18.365 --> 03:31:20.267
JEREMY MARTIN FROM THE UNION OF

03:31:20.334 --> 03:31:21.769
CONCERNED SCIENTISTS, MIKE

03:31:21.835 --> 03:31:24.304
SMITH FROM THE UNITED

03:31:24.371 --> 03:31:26.006
STEELWORKERS, ZACH LEARY FROM

03:31:26.073 --> 03:31:27.674
THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM

ASSOCIATION, AND CESAR AGUIRRE

03:31:29.843 --> 03:31:32.880
FROM THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA

03:31:32.946 --> 03:31:34.648
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NETWORK.

03:31:34.715 --> 03:31:36.350
THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US

03:31:36.417 --> 03:31:38.886
TODAY. AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING

03:31:38.952 --> 03:31:41.789
FORWARD TO YOUR INSIGHTS AND

03:31:41.855 --> 03:31:45.392
TESTIMONY TODAY. I BELIEVE WE

03:31:45.459 --> 03:31:47.594
ARE GOING TO BEGIN, MR. MARTIN,

03:31:47.661 --> 03:31:54.968
WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:31:55.035 --> 03:31:57.838
YOU CAN HEAR ME. YES. MY NAME

03:31:57.905 --> 03:31:59.139
IS JEREMY MARTIN. I'M THE

03:31:59.206 --> 03:32:00.808
DIRECTOR OF FUELS POLICY IN THE

03:32:00.874 --> 03:32:02.076
CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AT

03:32:02.142 --> 03:32:03.577
THE UNION OF CONCERNED

03:32:03.644 --> 03:32:05.813
SCIENTISTS. AS PROFESSOR

03:32:05.879 --> 03:32:06.980
GRUBERT LAID OUT AT THE

03:32:07.047 --> 03:32:09.216
BEGINNING OF THIS CONVERSATION,

03:32:09.283 --> 03:32:09.683
CALIFORNIA IS IN THIS

03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:12.186
TRANSITION ON ITS PATH TO CLEAN

03:32:12.252 --> 03:32:13.020
ENERGY. INITIAL PROPOSALS FROM

03:32:13.087 --> 03:32:14.721
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOCUS ON

03:32:14.788 --> 03:32:17.057
NEAR-TERM PRICE STABILIZATION,

03:32:17.124 --> 03:32:18.158
WHICH IS IMPORTANT BUT NOT

03:32:18.225 --> 03:32:19.760
SUFFICIENT. THE STATE MUST NOT

03:32:19.827 --> 03:32:21.862
LOSE SIGHT OF THE MEDIUM AND

03:32:21.929 --> 03:32:23.130
LONG TERM ACTIONS NECESSARY TO

03:32:23.197 --> 03:32:24.731
TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY. OR

03:32:24.798 --> 03:32:26.166
WE COULD FIND OURSELVES IN THIS

03:32:26.233 --> 03:32:28.068
SITUATION AGAIN VERY SOON. AS

03:32:28.135 --> 03:32:31.271
MY COLLEAGUE AT CSU WILL

03:32:31.338 --> 03:32:31.905
DISCUSS. NEAR-TERM

03:32:31.972 --> 03:32:33.774
STABILIZATION MUST BE CAREFULLY

03:32:33.841 --> 03:32:35.442
TARGETED AND INCLUDE ROBUST

03:32:35.509 --> 03:32:36.510
GUARDRAILS. ANY ACTIONS TO

03:32:36.577 --> 03:32:37.911
EXPAND FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION

03:32:37.978 --> 03:32:39.880
MUST BE AS NARROW AS POSSIBLE

03:32:39.947 --> 03:32:41.949
AND CANNOT COMPROMISE HEALTH

03:32:42.015 --> 03:32:42.716
PROTECTIONS, AND MUST BE

03:32:42.783 --> 03:32:44.718
COUPLED TO POLICIES TO KEEP

03:32:44.785 --> 03:32:47.020
CALIFORNIA MOVING FORWARD TO A

03:32:47.087 --> 03:32:47.921
CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUTURE.

03:32:47.988 --> 03:32:48.989
I'M GOING TO FOCUS THE

03:32:49.056 --> 03:32:50.691
REMAINDER OF MY TESTIMONY ON A

03:32:50.757 --> 03:32:51.925
FORWARD LOOKING, SCIENCE BASED

03:32:51.992 --> 03:32:53.927
POLICY THAT BALANCES NEAR-TERM

03:32:53.994 --> 03:32:54.795
PRICE CONSIDERATIONS WITH

03:32:54.862 --> 03:32:56.997
LONGER TERM POLLUTION REDUCTION

03:32:57.064 --> 03:32:59.066
GOALS. THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM

03:32:59.133 --> 03:33:00.734
WITH CALIFORNIA'S GASOLINE

03:33:00.801 --> 03:33:02.402
MARKETPLACE IS A LACK OF

03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:03.770
FLEXIBILITY AND COMPETITION.

03:33:03.837 --> 03:33:04.838
CALIFORNIA IS OFTEN CALLED A

03:33:04.905 --> 03:33:06.807
FUEL ISLAND CUT OFF FROM THE

03:33:06.874 --> 03:33:09.409
REST OF THE US. THE REASONS ARE

03:33:09.476 --> 03:33:10.677
PARTLY GEOGRAPHIC, BUT STATE

03:33:10.744 --> 03:33:11.945
AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS ALSO

03:33:12.012 --> 03:33:14.748
CONTRIBUTE. WHEN UNPLANNED

03:33:14.815 --> 03:33:15.916
REFINERY CLOSURES LEAD TO A

03:33:15.983 --> 03:33:17.251
SHORTAGE OF GASOLINE IN

03:33:17.317 --> 03:33:18.519
CALIFORNIA, CALIFORNIA FUEL

03:33:18.585 --> 03:33:20.287
MARKETS CAN'T USE WHATEVER

03:33:20.354 --> 03:33:21.288
GASOLINE IS NEARBY, BUT MUST

03:33:21.355 --> 03:33:23.123
INSTEAD SPECIAL ORDER THE

03:33:23.190 --> 03:33:23.857
UNIQUE FORMULATION FROM

03:33:23.924 --> 03:33:25.592
REFINERIES CONFIGURED TO MAKE

03:33:25.659 --> 03:33:28.729
IT OFTEN AS FAR AWAY AS ASIA.

03:33:28.795 --> 03:33:29.863
PRODUCING AND DELIVERING THIS

03:33:29.930 --> 03:33:30.797
FUEL TAKES WEEKS, CAUSING PRICE

03:33:30.864 --> 03:33:33.800
SPIKES THAT HARM CONSUMERS. BUT

03:33:33.867 --> 03:33:34.801
WHILE CALIFORNIA WAITS, THERE'S

03:33:34.868 --> 03:33:37.971
NO SHORTAGE OF US SPEC GASOLINE.

03:33:38.038 --> 03:33:39.106
SOME OF IT'S EVEN REFINED IN

03:33:39.173 --> 03:33:41.542
CALIFORNIA. IT MAKES ME THINK

03:33:41.608 --> 03:33:42.876
OF THE EXPRESSION WATER, WATER

03:33:42.943 --> 03:33:45.045
EVERYWHERE, BUT NOT A DROP TO

03:33:45.112 --> 03:33:46.813
DRINK. AND SO IT GOT ME

03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:48.315
WONDERING, YOU KNOW, IS

03:33:48.382 --> 03:33:48.916
CALIFORNIA GASOLINE REALLY SO

03:33:48.982 --> 03:33:50.684
SPECIAL? AND SO WE'VE LOOKED

03:33:50.751 --> 03:33:51.985
INTO IT AND I'LL SHARE BRIEFLY

03:33:52.052 --> 03:33:53.854
WHAT WE FOUND WHEN CALIFORNIA

03:33:53.921 --> 03:33:55.255
IMPLEMENTED ITS GASOLINE

03:33:55.322 --> 03:33:56.890
REGULATIONS STARTING IN THE

03:33:56.957 --> 03:33:57.891
1990S. IT'S CLEANER. BURNING

03:33:57.958 --> 03:34:00.327
GASOLINE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE

03:34:00.394 --> 03:34:01.728
IN AIR POLLUTION. CALIFORNIA

03:34:01.795 --> 03:34:03.197
REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED. OH, I

03:34:03.263 --> 03:34:05.999
DO HAVE SLIDES I FORGOT, BUT

03:34:06.066 --> 03:34:07.701
WONDERFUL. YES, I THINK WE CAN

03:34:07.768 --> 03:34:10.337
CATCH THOSE UP. YEAH. THANK YOU,

03:34:10.404 --> 03:34:11.638
BUT I'LL KEEP GOING. IN THE

03:34:11.705 --> 03:34:15.542
INTEREST OF TIME, SO

03:34:15.609 --> 03:34:16.710
CALIFORNIA'S GASOLINE

03:34:16.777 --> 03:34:17.744
REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED A

03:34:17.811 --> 03:34:19.846
SULFUR SPEC OF 30 PARTS PER

03:34:19.913 --> 03:34:20.747
MILLION AT A TIME WHEN GASOLINE

03:34:20.814 --> 03:34:22.816
IN THE REST OF THE US HAD

03:34:22.883 --> 03:34:24.117
SULFUR ABOVE 200 PARTS PER

03:34:24.184 --> 03:34:25.752
MILLION. AND THERE WAS A CHART

03:34:25.819 --> 03:34:26.887
SOMEWHERE THAT YOU'LL SEE

03:34:26.954 --> 03:34:28.922
EVENTUALLY ABOUT THAT. LOW

03:34:28.989 --> 03:34:29.723
SULFUR GASOLINE IS ESSENTIAL

03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:31.692
FOR EMISSIONS CONTROLS THAT

03:34:31.758 --> 03:34:33.560
MAKE MODERN CARS SO MUCH

03:34:33.627 --> 03:34:35.929
CLEANER. BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

03:34:35.996 --> 03:34:36.663
US GASOLINE REGULATIONS HAVE

03:34:36.730 --> 03:34:37.664
CHANGED A LOT, AND TODAY US

03:34:37.731 --> 03:34:40.634
GASOLINE HAS SULFUR SPEC OF TEN

03:34:40.701 --> 03:34:42.102
PPM. SO CALIFORNIA'S GASOLINE

03:34:42.169 --> 03:34:43.503
IS STILL CLEANER. AND IT

03:34:43.570 --> 03:34:44.738
PROVIDES AIR QUALITY BENEFITS,

03:34:44.805 --> 03:34:47.341
ESPECIALLY FROM THE OLDEST

03:34:47.407 --> 03:34:48.542
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. BUT THE

03:34:48.609 --> 03:34:49.843
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA

03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:51.345
GASOLINE AND US GASOLINE HAS

03:34:51.411 --> 03:34:54.314
BEEN SHRINKING, AND NEWER

03:34:54.381 --> 03:34:54.915
VEHICLES ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO

03:34:54.982 --> 03:34:56.817
DIFFERENT FUELS THAN THEY ONCE

03:34:56.883 --> 03:34:59.319
WERE. BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRESS

03:34:59.386 --> 03:35:00.787
ON CLEANER CARS, A

03:35:00.854 --> 03:35:02.556
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

03:35:02.623 --> 03:35:03.724
TAILPIPE POLLUTION COMES FROM

03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:05.892
THE OLDEST CARS ON THE ROAD,

03:35:05.959 --> 03:35:07.694
ESPECIALLY CARS SOLD BEFORE

03:35:07.761 --> 03:35:10.130
2004 THAT LACK MODERN EMISSION

03:35:10.197 --> 03:35:12.366
CONTROLS. A STUDY UCS CONDUCTED

03:35:12.432 --> 03:35:13.900
WITH THE GREENLINING INSTITUTE

03:35:13.967 --> 03:35:14.735
FOUND THAT ONE OF THE MOST

03:35:14.801 --> 03:35:15.869
IMPORTANT THINGS CALIFORNIA

03:35:15.936 --> 03:35:18.071
COULD DO TO CLEAN UP POLLUTION

03:35:18.138 --> 03:35:18.972
FROM CARS IS TO HELP THE

03:35:19.039 --> 03:35:22.109
DRIVERS OF CARS OLDER THAN 2004

03:35:22.175 --> 03:35:23.810
TRANSITION UPGRADE TO A NEW OR

03:35:23.877 --> 03:35:26.680
USED EV. GETTING OLDER CARS OFF

03:35:26.747 --> 03:35:28.415
THE ROAD REDUCES THE AIR

03:35:28.482 --> 03:35:28.982
POLLUTION BURDEN THAT FALLS

03:35:29.049 --> 03:35:29.716
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LATINO

03:35:29.783 --> 03:35:30.984
AND BLACK CALIFORNIANS AND

03:35:31.051 --> 03:35:32.853
LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. IT

03:35:32.919 --> 03:35:35.122
ALSO REDUCES GASOLINE DEMAND,

03:35:35.188 --> 03:35:36.857
AND EACH FAMILY THAT MOVES FROM

03:35:36.923 --> 03:35:38.525
AN INEFFICIENT OLD GASOLINE CAR

03:35:38.592 --> 03:35:40.794
TO A NEW OR USED EV IS NO

03:35:40.861 --> 03:35:43.096
LONGER VULNERABLE TO GAS PRICE

03:35:43.163 --> 03:35:45.766
SPIKES. SO THAT'S REALLY THE

03:35:45.832 --> 03:35:47.301
CORE LOGIC OF OUR PROPOSALS.

03:35:47.367 --> 03:35:48.669
WHEN SUPPLIES ARE CONSTRAINED,

03:35:48.735 --> 03:35:49.936
CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALLOW THE USE

03:35:50.003 --> 03:35:51.571
OF ANY GASOLINE THAT MEETS US

03:35:51.638 --> 03:35:54.074
REGULATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR A

03:35:54.141 --> 03:35:56.276
CONTRIBUTION TO HELP DRIVERS OF

03:35:56.343 --> 03:35:57.744
OLD CARS UPGRADE TO AN EV, AND

03:35:57.811 --> 03:36:00.113
TO ENSURE THERE ARE NO

03:36:00.180 --> 03:36:02.015
POLLUTION BENEFITS LOST AS A

03:36:02.082 --> 03:36:04.785
RESULT OF THIS EXCHANGE. SO OUR

03:36:04.851 --> 03:36:06.920
OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT DOING

03:36:06.987 --> 03:36:07.721
THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER CAN

03:36:07.788 --> 03:36:10.023
PROVIDE A NET AIR QUALITY

03:36:10.090 --> 03:36:11.758
BENEFIT, BECAUSE THE BENEFIT OF

03:36:11.825 --> 03:36:13.026
CLEANER CARS REPLACING THE

03:36:13.093 --> 03:36:14.561
OLDEST VEHICLES SURPASSES THE

03:36:14.628 --> 03:36:15.829
INCREMENTAL POLLUTION FROM

03:36:15.896 --> 03:36:16.863
SMALL CHANGES IN GASOLINE

03:36:16.930 --> 03:36:19.633
PROPERTIES. THIS WOULD BE A

03:36:19.700 --> 03:36:20.701
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WITH NO

03:36:20.767 --> 03:36:22.502
MANDATORY FEES, SO THIS

03:36:22.569 --> 03:36:24.705
FLEXIBILITY WOULD ONLY BE USED

03:36:24.771 --> 03:36:26.773
WHEN IT'S THE LEAST EXPENSIVE

03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:27.841
OPTION. WHEN THERE ISN'T

03:36:27.908 --> 03:36:29.676
CALIFORNIA GASOLINE AVAILABLE.

03:36:29.743 --> 03:36:31.578
THEREFORE, IT WON'T RAISE GAS

03:36:31.645 --> 03:36:33.647
PRICES AND IT CAN REDUCE OR

03:36:33.714 --> 03:36:35.315
AVOID GAS PRICE SPIKES AT

03:36:35.382 --> 03:36:38.485
MOMENTS OF ACUTE SHORTAGE. NOW,

03:36:38.552 --> 03:36:40.587
IT MIGHT BE TEMPTING TO TO LOOK

03:36:40.654 --> 03:36:41.788
AT THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON

03:36:41.855 --> 03:36:43.757
CLEAN CARS AND THINK THAT WE

03:36:43.824 --> 03:36:44.925
COULD JUST RELAX CALIFORNIA

03:36:44.991 --> 03:36:45.892
GASOLINE REGULATIONS AND

03:36:45.959 --> 03:36:47.761
SPECIFICATIONS WITHOUT ANY FEE.

03:36:47.828 --> 03:36:49.029
BUT THIS WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR

03:36:49.096 --> 03:36:51.531
TWO REASONS. THE FIRST IS

03:36:51.598 --> 03:36:53.100
ALLOWING UNRESTRICTED SALE OF

03:36:53.166 --> 03:36:53.934
CONVENTIONAL US GASOLINE

03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:54.901
WITHOUT A MITIGATION PROGRAM

03:36:54.968 --> 03:36:57.070
WOULD HARM AIR QUALITY AND

03:36:57.137 --> 03:36:58.105
PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT THE SECOND

03:36:58.171 --> 03:37:00.574
IS IT WOULD ACTUALLY RISK

03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:01.108
DESTABILIZING CALIFORNIA'S

03:37:01.174 --> 03:37:02.809
REFINERY MARKET. CALIFORNIA

03:37:02.876 --> 03:37:04.778
REFINERIES ARE CONFIGURED TO

03:37:04.845 --> 03:37:06.880
MAKE CALIFORNIA SPEC GASOLINE,

03:37:06.947 --> 03:37:08.048
AND SUDDENLY CHANGING THE RULES

03:37:08.115 --> 03:37:08.849
COULD MAKE THEM LESS

03:37:08.915 --> 03:37:11.051
COMPETITIVE AND MIGHT HASTEN

03:37:11.118 --> 03:37:12.652
ADDITIONAL REFINERY CLOSURES.

03:37:12.719 --> 03:37:14.020
CALIFORNIA GASOLINE REGULATIONS

03:37:14.087 --> 03:37:16.056
ARE OVERDUE FOR MODERNIZATION,

03:37:16.123 --> 03:37:17.190
AND DOING THIS RIGHT WOULD

03:37:17.257 --> 03:37:19.393
PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH, REDUCE

03:37:19.459 --> 03:37:20.861
COSTS, INCREASE FLEXIBILITY,

03:37:20.927 --> 03:37:21.995
AND COULD CREATE A MORE

03:37:22.062 --> 03:37:22.863
CONNECTED MARKET, IDEALLY IN

03:37:22.929 --> 03:37:24.631
COORDINATION WITH OTHER WESTERN

03:37:24.698 --> 03:37:26.700
STATES. BUT DOING THIS PROPERLY

03:37:26.767 --> 03:37:28.301
WILL TAKE TIME, AND A RUSHED

03:37:28.368 --> 03:37:30.537
JOB COULD BACKFIRE. STABILIZING

03:37:30.604 --> 03:37:31.838
CALIFORNIA'S GASOLINE MARKETS

03:37:31.905 --> 03:37:33.039
AS WE TRANSITION TO CLEAN CARS

03:37:33.106 --> 03:37:34.274
AND RENEWABLE ENERGY MAKES

DRILLING OR ROLLING BACK

CONSUMERS, PUBLIC HEALTH OR THE

03:37:40.247 --> 03:37:41.648

SHORTEN THAT FOR THE TIMING

03:38:26.960 --> 03:38:28.929

TRANSPORTATION FUELS CRISIS

03:39:14.908 --> 03:39:15.909
THAT COULD QUICKLY SPIRAL OUT

03:39:15.976 --> 03:39:17.777
OF CONTROL IF THE ANNOUNCED

03:39:17.844 --> 03:39:19.813
CLOSURES OF P66 IN LOS ANGELES

03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:20.981
AND VALERO IN BENICIA MOVE

03:39:21.047 --> 03:39:22.983
FORWARD. THESE CLOSURES WILL

03:39:23.049 --> 03:39:24.584
PLACE DRAMATIC PRESSURE TO

03:39:24.651 --> 03:39:26.286
IMPORT FINISHED PRODUCT FROM

03:39:26.353 --> 03:39:27.387
OVERSEAS TO MEET THE STATE'S

03:39:27.454 --> 03:39:28.722
NEEDS AT INCREASED COSTS AND

03:39:28.788 --> 03:39:30.824
COMPARED TO LOCAL REFINING,

03:39:30.891 --> 03:39:32.559
STABILIZING THE STATE'S CRUDE

03:39:32.626 --> 03:39:34.227
PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY TO

03:39:34.294 --> 03:39:35.762
REFINERIES DEPENDED ON IT, AS

03:39:35.829 --> 03:39:36.763
WELL AS BUILDING INVESTOR

03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:37.831
CONFIDENCE IN REFINING SECTOR

03:39:37.898 --> 03:39:39.766
IS IMPERATIVE TO STABILIZING

03:39:39.833 --> 03:39:41.701
THE SECTOR IN THE STATE AND TO

03:39:41.768 --> 03:39:43.303
ENSURE SAFE AND RELIABLE

03:39:43.370 --> 03:39:44.538
OPERATIONS INTO THE FUTURE. USA

03:39:44.604 --> 03:39:45.872
BELIEVES CALIFORNIA SHOULD

03:39:45.939 --> 03:39:47.841
MAINTAIN REFINING CAPACITY AS

03:39:47.908 --> 03:39:49.543
THEY ARE AMONG THE SAFEST AND

03:39:49.609 --> 03:39:50.744
CLEANEST IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE

03:39:50.810 --> 03:39:52.812
THE SAFEST AND CLEANEST DUE TO

03:39:52.879 --> 03:39:54.814
THE GOOD, SOUND LEGISLATION AND

03:39:54.881 --> 03:39:56.750
REGULATIONS THAT THE STATE HAS

03:39:56.816 --> 03:39:57.951
IMPLEMENTED AND WHICH HAVE BEEN

03:39:58.018 --> 03:40:00.654
SUPPORTED MOSTLY BY THE USA. AS

03:40:00.720 --> 03:40:02.689
MENTIONED, FAILURE TO FIND

03:40:02.756 --> 03:40:03.623
PATHWAYS TO MAINTAINING

03:40:03.690 --> 03:40:05.225
DOMESTIC REFINING CAPACITY WILL

03:40:05.292 --> 03:40:06.326
LEAD TO IMPORTS OF REFINED

03:40:06.393 --> 03:40:07.727
FUELS, LIKELY FROM REFINERIES

03:40:07.794 --> 03:40:09.763
THAT DO NOT MEET AMERICAN

03:40:09.829 --> 03:40:12.399
WORKERS, AND AIR AND WATER

03:40:12.465 --> 03:40:13.099
QUALITY STANDARDS. RECENT

03:40:13.166 --> 03:40:14.401
REPORTING HIGHLIGHTS CALIFORNIA

03:40:14.467 --> 03:40:16.303
FUEL IMPORTS AT A FOUR YEAR

03:40:16.369 --> 03:40:18.171
HIGH AMID REFINING OUTAGES THIS

03:40:18.238 --> 03:40:19.873
YEAR, AND THOSE IMPORTS WILL

03:40:19.940 --> 03:40:21.074
ONLY INCREASE IF CLOSURES

03:40:21.141 --> 03:40:23.643
ACCELERATE. THIS CREATES A

03:40:23.710 --> 03:40:24.844
HIGHER CHANCE OF SUPPLY CHAIN

03:40:24.911 --> 03:40:26.680
SHOCK, SHOCK, FOREIGN POLLUTION

03:40:26.746 --> 03:40:28.615
AND SPIKES IN FUEL COSTS.

03:40:28.682 --> 03:40:30.016
ANOTHER POINT ON WHY CALIFORNIA

03:40:30.083 --> 03:40:31.084
LEGISLATORS SHOULD TAKE

03:40:31.151 --> 03:40:32.719
ADDITIONAL STEPS TO MAINTAIN

03:40:32.786 --> 03:40:34.554
REFINING CAPACITY IS THE STATE

03:40:34.621 --> 03:40:36.723
IS IN THE STATE IS THE UNIONS

03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:38.124
EXPERIENCE WITH PREVIOUS

03:40:38.191 --> 03:40:39.626
LAYOFFS? WORKING WITH A BROAD

03:40:39.693 --> 03:40:42.796
CROSS SECTOR OF STAKEHOLDERS, A

03:40:42.862 --> 03:40:44.631
STUDY WAS DONE ON THE IMPACT TO

03:40:44.698 --> 03:40:45.966
OUR MEMBERS FROM A RECENT

03:40:46.032 --> 03:40:47.767
REFINERY CLOSURES. IT SHOWED

03:40:47.834 --> 03:40:48.868
25% OF THE REFINERY WORKERS

03:40:48.935 --> 03:40:51.271
WERE UNABLE TO GET A JOB, AND

03:40:51.338 --> 03:40:51.805
THOSE THAT WERE FORTUNATE

03:40:51.871 --> 03:40:53.807
ENOUGH TO FIND ONE. IT CAME

03:40:53.873 --> 03:40:56.042
WITH AN INCOME BETWEEN 25 AND

03:40:56.109 --> 03:40:57.777
30% LESS THAN AT THE REFINERY

03:40:57.844 --> 03:40:59.746
WORKERS LOSING THEIR COLLECTIVE

03:40:59.813 --> 03:41:00.547
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS IN

03:41:00.614 --> 03:41:03.016
EXCHANGE FOR LOWER PAY BENEFITS

03:41:03.083 --> 03:41:05.552
AND JOB LESS JOB PROTECTIONS

03:41:05.619 --> 03:41:06.586
AND HIGHER, HIGHER GASOLINE

03:41:06.653 --> 03:41:09.155
PRICES IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

03:41:09.222 --> 03:41:11.725
OUR UNION WON'T BURY OUR HEAD

03:41:11.791 --> 03:41:13.360
IN THE SAND ABOUT THE FUTURE.

03:41:13.426 --> 03:41:15.428
THAT IS WHY WE WILL PUSH TO

03:41:15.495 --> 03:41:16.129
BUILD A TRUE, REALISTIC

03:41:16.196 --> 03:41:17.864
TRANSITION PLAN FOR THE FUTURE

03:41:17.931 --> 03:41:19.933
IN THE OIL, FOR THE WORKERS IN

03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:21.635
THE OIL SECTOR, SO THAT THE

03:41:21.701 --> 03:41:23.103
WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES

03:41:23.169 --> 03:41:24.871
DO NOT GET LEFT BEHIND. AND THE

03:41:24.938 --> 03:41:26.106
FUELS TRANSITION ISN'T JUST PUT

03:41:26.172 --> 03:41:28.174
ON THE BACKS OF OIL WORKERS IN

03:41:28.241 --> 03:41:29.643
THE STATE. AND IF THE STATE IS

03:41:29.709 --> 03:41:30.944
SUCCESSFUL IN STABILIZING THE

03:41:31.011 --> 03:41:32.912
REFINING SECTOR FOR THE NEAR

03:41:32.979 --> 03:41:34.681
FUTURE, WE SHOULD NOT WASTE

03:41:34.748 --> 03:41:36.383
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THAT

03:41:36.449 --> 03:41:38.885
TRUE, REALISTIC PLAN. IN

03:41:38.952 --> 03:41:39.886
CONCLUSION, IT IS OUR BELIEF

03:41:39.953 --> 03:41:42.989
THAT WE CAN STABILIZE OUR

03:41:43.056 --> 03:41:43.590
TRANSPORTATION FUEL SUPPLY IN

03:41:43.657 --> 03:41:45.892
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHILE

03:41:45.959 --> 03:41:47.460
STILL ACHIEVING THE CLIMATE

03:41:47.527 --> 03:41:49.129
GOALS OF THE STATE. BUT IT WILL

03:41:49.195 --> 03:41:50.563
TAKE ALL STAKEHOLDERS COMING TO

03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:51.865
THE TABLE WORKING TOGETHER, AND

03:41:51.931 --> 03:41:53.733
WE LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING IN

03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:55.568
THE WORK TO ENSURE THAT AS THE

03:41:55.635 --> 03:41:56.803
OUTCOME. THANK YOU AND I LOOK

03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:57.904
FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY

03:41:57.971 --> 03:41:59.606
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. AND I

03:41:59.673 --> 03:42:01.708
BELIEVE NEXT UP IS MR. LEARY

03:42:15.822 --> 03:42:18.224
PIVOTAL POINT IN TIME IN

03:42:18.291 --> 03:42:19.592
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY TO

03:42:19.659 --> 03:42:20.827
DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF OUR

03:42:20.894 --> 03:42:22.896
INDUSTRY AND THE COSTS YOUR

03:42:22.962 --> 03:42:23.963
CONSTITUENTS WILL LIKELY BEAR

03:42:24.030 --> 03:42:25.765
IF CURRENT POLICY TRENDS

03:42:25.832 --> 03:42:27.534
CONTINUE. WE APPRECIATE THE

03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:30.003
WORK OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND

03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.970
THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE OVER

03:42:31.037 --> 03:42:33.173
THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS TO

03:42:33.239 --> 03:42:33.873
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES WE

03:42:33.940 --> 03:42:36.009
ARE FACING RELATED TO GASOLINE

03:42:36.076 --> 03:42:38.011
SUPPLY AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE

03:42:38.078 --> 03:42:39.612
IN CALIFORNIA. WE AS AN

INDUSTRY WORKED CLOSELY WITH

03:42:41.581 --> 03:42:42.816
THE CEC AT THE DIRECTION, AT

03:42:42.882 --> 03:42:44.384
THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION, ON

03:42:44.451 --> 03:42:46.920
WHAT WE THINK IT WILL TAKE TO

03:42:46.986 --> 03:42:48.021
STABILIZE OUR SECTOR, TO ENSURE

03:42:48.088 --> 03:42:49.522
THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE

03:42:49.589 --> 03:42:52.025
AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SAFE

03:42:52.092 --> 03:42:52.859
TRANSPORTATION FUELS WHEN THEY

03:42:52.926 --> 03:42:55.729
PULL UP TO THE GAS STATION. BUT

03:42:55.795 --> 03:42:56.996
BEFORE I GET INTO WHAT WE THINK

03:42:57.063 --> 03:42:58.665
IT WILL BE REQUIRED, I WANT TO

03:42:58.732 --> 03:43:00.967
GROUND US IN SOME FACTS ABOUT

03:43:01.034 --> 03:43:01.901
DEMAND. I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT

03:43:01.968 --> 03:43:03.636
OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT WITH

03:43:03.703 --> 03:43:06.272
THE VICE CHAIR FOR OUR PRODUCT

03:43:06.339 --> 03:43:07.574
IN CALIFORNIA, ARIZONA AND

03:43:07.640 --> 03:43:09.809
NEVADA, AND WE WERE SET UP THAT

03:43:09.876 --> 03:43:11.010
WAY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

03:43:11.077 --> 03:43:12.579
RESOURCES, WE HAVE THE PORTS,

03:43:12.645 --> 03:43:13.880
WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

03:43:13.947 --> 03:43:15.782
SUPPLY THOSE MARKETS.

03:43:15.849 --> 03:43:17.117
CALIFORNIA IS THE THIRD LARGEST

03:43:17.183 --> 03:43:18.718
CONSUMER OF GASOLINE, ONLY

03:43:18.785 --> 03:43:21.921
BEHIND THE US AND CHINA. OUR

03:43:21.988 --> 03:43:24.124
DRIVERS ARE DRIVING ABOUT 300

03:43:24.190 --> 03:43:26.726
BILLION MILES A YEAR, CONSUMING

03:43:26.793 --> 03:43:29.229
ABOUT 13 BILLION GALLONS OF

03:43:29.295 --> 03:43:31.564

03:43:35.235 --> 03:43:37.771
ABOUT 35 MILLION GALLONS A DAY.

03:43:37.837 --> 03:43:39.572
ARIZONA GETTING HALF THEIR FUEL

03:43:39.639 --> 03:43:41.775
FROM US. NEVADA ABOUT 90% OF

03:43:41.841 --> 03:43:43.176
THEIR FUEL FROM US. IN

03:43:43.243 --> 03:43:46.146
CALIFORNIA, WE PRODUCE 25% OF

03:43:46.212 --> 03:43:47.547
THE CRUDE OIL THAT REFINERIES

03:43:47.614 --> 03:43:49.048
NEED TO MAKE GASOLINE. BUT THIS

03:43:49.115 --> 03:43:50.750
IS NOT FOR A LACK OF THE

03:43:50.817 --> 03:43:52.185
RESOURCE, BECAUSE OIL AND GAS

03:43:52.252 --> 03:43:53.219
IS ABUNDANT IN CALIFORNIA. THIS

03:43:53.286 --> 03:43:54.754
HAS BEEN A POLICY, POLICY

03:43:54.821 --> 03:43:56.823
DECISION TO MAKE US DEPENDENT

03:43:56.890 --> 03:43:58.992
ON FOREIGN SOURCES OF CRUDE,

03:43:59.058 --> 03:44:00.760
AND WE EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF

03:44:00.827 --> 03:44:02.862
HIGHLY SKILLED AND TRAINED

03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:03.797
PEOPLE AND CONTRIBUTE BILLIONS

03:44:03.863 --> 03:44:06.599
IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE.

03:44:06.666 --> 03:44:08.701
WE ARE ALSO PROBABLY ONE OF THE

03:44:08.768 --> 03:44:10.170
LARGEST SOURCE SOURCES OF

03:44:10.236 --> 03:44:11.604
REVENUE FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS

03:44:11.671 --> 03:44:13.740
REDUCTION FUND UNDER THE CAP

03:44:13.807 --> 03:44:15.608
AND TRADE PROGRAM, SO THE

03:44:15.675 --> 03:44:16.810
STATE'S ENERGY AND CLIMATE

03:44:16.876 --> 03:44:17.877
POLICIES ARE EXTREMELY

03:44:17.944 --> 03:44:19.746
IMPORTANT TO GET RIGHT, BECAUSE

03:44:19.813 --> 03:44:21.648
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT WILL

03:44:21.714 --> 03:44:24.083
BE BE THE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS,

03:44:24.150 --> 03:44:25.518
THE WORKFORCE AND ULTIMATELY

03:44:25.585 --> 03:44:26.820
THE STATE BUDGET. TODAY, I'M

03:44:26.886 --> 03:44:29.222
GOING TO HIGHLIGHT SIX KEY

03:44:29.289 --> 03:44:30.023
ISSUES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO

03:44:30.089 --> 03:44:32.258
ADDRESS TO RESTORE INVESTOR

03:44:32.325 --> 03:44:33.860
CONFIDENCE AND STABILIZE THE

03:44:33.927 --> 03:44:34.694
INDUSTRY, TO HOPEFULLY KEEP MY

03:44:34.761 --> 03:44:36.763
MEMBER COMPANIES OPERATING IN

03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:38.698
THIS MARKET TO MEET THE DEMAND

03:44:38.765 --> 03:44:39.833
OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. FIRST IS

03:44:39.899 --> 03:44:41.868
ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I

03:44:41.935 --> 03:44:43.803
KNOW THERE'S A BROAD DISCUSSION

03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:44.671
HAPPENING ON THE

03:44:44.737 --> 03:44:45.805
REAUTHORIZATION, AS YOU

03:44:45.872 --> 03:44:46.439
CONSIDER THE REAUTHORIZATION OF

03:44:46.506 --> 03:44:47.774
THIS PROGRAM IS BECOMING

03:44:47.841 --> 03:44:48.875
INCREASINGLY APPARENT THAT YOU

03:44:48.942 --> 03:44:50.977
NEED TO PROTECT AGAINST LEAKAGE,

03:44:51.044 --> 03:44:52.879
BOTH ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL,

03:44:52.946 --> 03:44:55.248
AND SHOULD DESIGN THE PROGRAM

03:44:55.315 --> 03:44:57.217
IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS HIGHLY

03:44:57.283 --> 03:44:57.817
TRADE EXPOSED INDUSTRIES LIKE

03:44:57.884 --> 03:44:59.819
THOSE IN THE TRANSPORTATION

03:44:59.886 --> 03:45:01.921
FUELS SECTOR. YOU ARE SEEING

03:45:01.988 --> 03:45:02.789
LEAKAGE IN REAL TIME, AND THE

03:45:02.856 --> 03:45:04.891
PROGRAM SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR THAT.

03:45:04.958 --> 03:45:06.759
NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR MAJOR

03:45:06.826 --> 03:45:08.761
REFORMS AND CHANGES TO THE

03:45:08.828 --> 03:45:09.996
PROGRAM, BUT RATHER SIMPLE

03:45:10.063 --> 03:45:10.997
ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE GROUNDED

03:45:11.064 --> 03:45:12.765
IN AFFORDABILITY AND COST

03:45:12.832 --> 03:45:13.833
CONTAINMENT. ON THE OIL

03:45:13.900 --> 03:45:15.568
PRODUCTION PIECE THAT THE

03:45:15.635 --> 03:45:17.003
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PRESENTED

03:45:17.070 --> 03:45:18.938
EARLIER, THE ADMINISTRATION, IT

03:45:19.005 --> 03:45:21.875
DOES THOSE FOUR THINGS, ONE OF

03:45:21.941 --> 03:45:24.677
WHICH IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR

03:45:24.744 --> 03:45:25.812
PRODUCTION IN KERN COUNTY. FROM

03:45:25.879 --> 03:45:27.513
OUR VIEW, TWO OF THE POLICIES

03:45:27.580 --> 03:45:29.282
WE VIEW AS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:31.651
FOR SUPPLY AND THE THE TWO FOR

03:45:31.718 --> 03:45:33.686
ONE, PLUGGING AND ABANDONING

03:45:33.753 --> 03:45:35.855
FOR ONE NEW DRILL PERMIT, WE

03:45:35.922 --> 03:45:37.490
THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

03:45:37.557 --> 03:45:39.759
SOME RECOGNITION FOR OUR IDLE

03:45:39.826 --> 03:45:40.927
WELL MANAGEMENT PLANS TO MAKE

03:45:40.994 --> 03:45:43.630
SURE ITS EFFECTIVENESS. SO

03:45:43.696 --> 03:45:45.965
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON

03:45:46.032 --> 03:45:47.901
THE GOVERNOR'S OIL PRODUCTION

03:45:47.967 --> 03:45:50.136
BILL, BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET

03:45:50.203 --> 03:45:53.072
THERE. ON THE POINT OF

03:45:53.139 --> 03:45:53.840
GOVERNMENT HARMONIZATION, WE

03:45:53.907 --> 03:45:55.608
THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A

03:45:55.675 --> 03:45:56.843
RECOGNITION THAT LOCAL AND

03:45:56.910 --> 03:45:58.111
REGIONAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES

03:45:58.177 --> 03:45:59.612
ARE HAVING AN IMPACT ON

03:45:59.679 --> 03:46:01.714
STATEWIDE FUEL SUPPLY. THESE

03:46:01.781 --> 03:46:03.783
POLICIES ARE HAPPENING IN SILOS

03:46:03.850 --> 03:46:04.751
WITHOUT STATE OVERSIGHT. THERE

03:46:04.817 --> 03:46:06.953
HAS BEEN THERE HAS TO BE A

03:46:07.020 --> 03:46:08.621
STATE ENTITY THAT PLAYS THAT

03:46:08.688 --> 03:46:09.689
OVERSIGHT ROLE ON LOCAL

03:46:09.756 --> 03:46:11.824
POLICIES THAT PUT STATEWIDE

03:46:11.891 --> 03:46:13.793
GASOLINE SUPPLY AT RISK ON THE

03:46:13.860 --> 03:46:16.095
SIDE OF INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH

03:46:16.162 --> 03:46:17.664
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR

03:46:17.730 --> 03:46:19.766
ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND WORK AT

03:46:19.832 --> 03:46:20.934
THE REFINERIES AND FOR THE

03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:23.870
SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. WE THINK

03:46:23.937 --> 03:46:25.538
THAT THE INVESTMENT IN

03:46:25.605 --> 03:46:26.773
INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAINTENANCE,

03:46:26.839 --> 03:46:29.175
AS THE LOW CARBON ECONOMY

03:46:29.242 --> 03:46:30.410
EVOLVES IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL,

03:46:30.476 --> 03:46:31.778
AND WE RECOMMEND A STATE AGENCY

03:46:31.844 --> 03:46:34.047
LIKE THE CDC TO HELP COORDINATE

03:46:34.113 --> 03:46:35.882
AND PERMIT MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE

03:46:35.949 --> 03:46:38.084
PROJECTS TO ENSURE WE CAN

03:46:38.151 --> 03:46:39.152
CONTINUE TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE

03:46:39.218 --> 03:46:41.087
AND RELIABLE FUEL TO YOUR

03:46:41.154 --> 03:46:42.922
CONSUMERS. NOW, TWO OF THE

03:46:42.989 --> 03:46:44.624
ISSUES I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

03:46:44.691 --> 03:46:46.726
BRIEFLY ARE IN THE HANDS OF THE

03:46:46.793 --> 03:46:47.827
ADMINISTRATION AND TALKED ABOUT

03:46:47.894 --> 03:46:49.562
THEM A BIT WITH THEM UP AT THE

03:46:49.629 --> 03:46:52.165
DAIS. THE FIRST IS THE APP

03:46:52.231 --> 03:46:53.566
BERTH REGULATION. AND FROM AND

03:46:53.633 --> 03:46:55.802
WE VIEW THAT AS OFFERING NO

03:46:55.868 --> 03:46:58.037
FEASIBLE PATHWAY TO COMPLIANCE.

03:46:58.104 --> 03:46:59.706
THIS REGULATION FORCES US TO

03:46:59.772 --> 03:47:01.941
ELECTRIFY OR USE A TECHNOLOGY

03:47:02.008 --> 03:47:04.010
THAT IS NOT SAFE OR

03:47:04.077 --> 03:47:05.211
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. WE

03:47:05.278 --> 03:47:06.346
RECOMMEND THEY PAUSE THIS

03:47:06.412 --> 03:47:09.215
REGULATION TO TO ENSURE THAT

03:47:09.282 --> 03:47:10.116
THERE ARE SUCCESSFUL PATHWAYS

03:47:10.183 --> 03:47:11.784
TO COMPLIANCE. THE SECOND IS

03:47:11.851 --> 03:47:13.953
THE MARGIN CAP AND PENALTY. AND

03:47:14.020 --> 03:47:15.755
THIS IS THE THE TOOL THAT WAS

03:47:15.822 --> 03:47:17.623
GIVEN IN THE FIRST SPECIAL

03:47:17.690 --> 03:47:20.426
SESSION THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:47:20.493 --> 03:47:23.129
GRANTED TO THE ADMINISTRATION

03:47:23.196 --> 03:47:24.130
UNDER THE FALSE ACCUSATION THAT

03:47:24.197 --> 03:47:27.066
WE AS AN INDUSTRY, WERE PRICE

03:47:27.133 --> 03:47:27.800
GOUGING OR COLLUDING TO

03:47:27.867 --> 03:47:29.736
MANIPULATE PRICES. BUT THE

03:47:29.802 --> 03:47:31.804
OTHER TOOL THAT YOU GAVE THE

03:47:31.871 --> 03:47:33.539
CSC WAS SUNSHINE AND

03:47:33.606 --> 03:47:34.640
TRANSPARENCY. AND THAT HAS

03:47:34.707 --> 03:47:36.676
REVEALED THAT WE ARE DOING

03:47:36.743 --> 03:47:37.844
NEITHER PRICE GOUGING NOR

03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:39.545
COLLUDING. OUR PREFERENCE WOULD

03:47:39.612 --> 03:47:40.980
BE THAT THE MARGIN CAP AND

03:47:41.047 --> 03:47:43.316
PENALTY BE REPEALED BY THE

03:47:43.383 --> 03:47:44.784
LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE MORE

03:47:44.851 --> 03:47:47.253
CERTAINTY FOR REFINERY

03:47:47.320 --> 03:47:48.054
INVESTMENTS. BUT AT A MINIMUM,

03:47:48.121 --> 03:47:50.256
WE BELIEVE THE CEC SHOULD PAUSE

03:47:50.323 --> 03:47:52.725
THIS POLICY FOR NO LESS THAN

03:47:52.792 --> 03:47:56.095
TEN YEARS, IF NOT LONGER,

03:47:56.162 --> 03:47:57.163
BECAUSE IT IS CURRENTLY

03:47:57.230 --> 03:47:58.731
DETERRING INVESTMENT. LIKE I

03:47:58.798 --> 03:48:00.900
SAID EARLIER, THE LEGISLATURE

03:48:00.967 --> 03:48:01.667
AND ADMINISTRATION ARE AT A

03:48:01.734 --> 03:48:03.836
HISTORIC MOMENT. WE AS AN

03:48:03.903 --> 03:48:05.004
INDUSTRY HAVE LAID OUT WHAT WE

03:48:05.071 --> 03:48:06.806
THINK IT WILL TAKE TO CONTINUE

03:48:06.873 --> 03:48:08.941
TO SUPPLY THIS MARKET, BUT IT

03:48:09.008 --> 03:48:10.576
WILL TAKE POLITICAL COURAGE AND

03:48:10.643 --> 03:48:13.146
BOLD ACTION BY YOU AND THE

03:48:13.212 --> 03:48:14.013
ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU AGAIN

03:48:14.080 --> 03:48:15.982
FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY.

03:48:16.049 --> 03:48:16.816
REALLY APPRECIATE THE DIALOG

03:48:16.883 --> 03:48:18.051
AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING

03:48:18.117 --> 03:48:20.686
ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU, MR.

03:48:20.753 --> 03:48:22.155
LEARY. MR. GEARY, YOU'LL GO

03:48:22.221 --> 03:48:24.724
NEXT. THANK YOU. I DO HAVE SOME

03:48:24.791 --> 03:48:30.296
SLIDES THAT ACCOMPANY MY MY

03:48:30.363 --> 03:48:31.831
SPEECH HERE WHILE THE SLIDES

03:48:31.898 --> 03:48:32.698
ARE BEING PULLED UP. I THINK I

03:48:32.765 --> 03:48:34.801
CAN GIVE SOME CONTEXT. I'M A

03:48:34.867 --> 03:48:36.636
RESIDENT OF KERN COUNTY. I'VE

03:48:36.702 --> 03:48:39.372
LIVED THERE SINCE THE YEAR 2000.

03:48:39.439 --> 03:48:41.274
I CERTIFIED THERMOGRAPHIC

03:48:41.340 --> 03:48:42.708
INSPECTOR. I HAVE THE

03:48:42.775 --> 03:48:44.077
INSPECTION 101 THROUGH CARB.

03:48:44.143 --> 03:48:45.578
I'VE ALSO BEEN PREVIOUSLY

03:48:45.645 --> 03:48:47.747
CERTIFIED WITH VISIBLE EMISSION

03:48:47.814 --> 03:48:48.714
EVALUATIONS ALONG WITH BEING A

03:48:48.781 --> 03:48:50.583
LIFETIME KERN COUNTY RESIDENT.

03:48:50.650 --> 03:48:51.818
SO I'VE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES

03:48:51.884 --> 03:48:53.953
OF WHAT, YOU KNOW, THE OIL

03:48:54.020 --> 03:48:55.054
INFRASTRUCTURE DOES TO

03:48:55.121 --> 03:48:57.890
FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES. SO I

03:48:57.957 --> 03:48:59.692
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LISTEN

03:48:59.759 --> 03:49:01.894
TO KERN COUNTY RESIDENTS HERE

03:49:01.961 --> 03:49:03.863
ON THE ON THE SLIDES WHEN THEY

03:49:03.930 --> 03:49:05.965
GET PULLED UP HERE. THERE'S AN

03:49:06.032 --> 03:49:07.066
IMPORTANT COMPARISON FOR THE

03:49:07.133 --> 03:49:08.901
AIR QUALITY IN BAKERSFIELD

03:49:08.968 --> 03:49:10.937
VERSUS THE REST OF CALIFORNIA.

03:49:11.003 --> 03:49:13.439
IN A CHART THAT SHOWS AIR

03:49:13.506 --> 03:49:14.907
QUALITY INDEXES ON SLIDE TWO.

03:49:14.974 --> 03:49:16.642
ON THE NEXT ONE HERE, WE CAN

03:49:16.709 --> 03:49:19.745
SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO COMPARE

03:49:19.812 --> 03:49:20.913
BAKERSFIELD TO OTHER PARTS OF

03:49:20.980 --> 03:49:22.048
CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF AIR

03:49:22.115 --> 03:49:25.051
QUALITY. SO IF YOU COULD GO

03:49:25.118 --> 03:49:26.185
BACK ONE. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

03:49:26.252 --> 03:49:28.888
THANK YOU. SO THE YELLOW AND

03:49:28.955 --> 03:49:30.756
RED SHOWS UNHEALTHY AND UNSAFE

03:49:30.823 --> 03:49:32.925
AIR QUALITY IN BAKERSFIELD FROM

03:49:32.992 --> 03:49:36.662
1999 TO OR FROM 1999 TO 2024.

03:49:36.729 --> 03:49:38.498
SO FOR 25 YEARS, THIS IS WHAT

03:49:38.564 --> 03:49:40.700
IT'S LIKE FOR THE LUNGS OF

03:49:40.766 --> 03:49:41.868
PEOPLE IN KERN COUNTY. WE CAN

03:49:41.934 --> 03:49:43.569
ALSO SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE THAT

03:49:43.636 --> 03:49:45.538
WHERE I COME FROM IN KERN

03:49:45.605 --> 03:49:47.206
COUNTY, WHERE WE PRODUCE 70% OF

03:49:47.273 --> 03:49:48.708
CALIFORNIA'S OIL, WE ARE ALSO

03:49:48.774 --> 03:49:50.743
THE COMMUNITY THAT BEARS THE

03:49:50.810 --> 03:49:52.011
BRUNT OF THE DAILY BURDEN OF

03:49:52.078 --> 03:49:53.980
POLLUTION FROM THE OIL AND GAS

03:49:54.046 --> 03:49:56.149
SECTOR, METHANE AND TOXIC SPEW

03:49:56.215 --> 03:49:57.083
FROM OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE

03:49:57.150 --> 03:49:58.684
INTO OUR HOMES, SCHOOLS AND

03:49:58.751 --> 03:49:59.986
HOSPITALS. AND WE'VE LEARNED TO

03:50:00.052 --> 03:50:01.487
WARN OUR NEIGHBORS OF POSSIBLE

03:50:01.554 --> 03:50:02.722
EXPLOSIVE LEAKS TO KEEP THEM

03:50:02.788 --> 03:50:04.957
SAFE. ON THE NEXT SLIDE, YOU'LL

03:50:05.024 --> 03:50:07.059
LEARN WHY WE LEARNED HOW TO USE

03:50:07.126 --> 03:50:08.861
INFRARED CAMERAS SO THAT WE CAN

03:50:08.928 --> 03:50:10.963
SEE THESE TOXIC GASES LEAKING

03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.764
INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. THE WORK

03:50:11.831 --> 03:50:13.833
THAT WE DO TO PROTECT ONE

03:50:13.900 --> 03:50:15.501
ANOTHER IS JUSTIFIED, AND THIS

03:50:15.568 --> 03:50:16.836
SLIDE IS EVIDENCE OF A VAST

03:50:16.903 --> 03:50:19.105
BODY OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

03:50:19.172 --> 03:50:19.705
THAT SHOWS THAT OIL DRILLING

03:50:19.772 --> 03:50:21.674
HAS CAUSED GENERATIONS OF

03:50:21.741 --> 03:50:22.842
ASTHMA, CANCER, BIRTH

03:50:22.909 --> 03:50:24.844
COMPLICATIONS, AND TOXIC STRESS

03:50:24.911 --> 03:50:25.578
DISEASES THAT ARE

03:50:25.645 --> 03:50:26.812
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING

03:50:26.879 --> 03:50:28.514
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE

03:50:28.581 --> 03:50:30.650
FOSSIL FUEL POLLUTION MAKES OUR

03:50:30.716 --> 03:50:32.018
HEALTH WORSE. IT SHORTENS OUR

03:50:32.084 --> 03:50:33.653
LIFESPAN, AS EVIDENCED BY THE

03:50:33.719 --> 03:50:35.688
NEXT SLIDE HERE, WHICH IS A

03:50:35.755 --> 03:50:36.856
TESTIMONY OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS A

03:50:36.923 --> 03:50:37.890
WELL IN THEIR BACKYARD AND

03:50:37.957 --> 03:50:39.792
SUFFERS FROM DAILY NOSEBLEEDS,

03:50:39.859 --> 03:50:40.493
HEADACHES, FATIGUE, DIZZINESS

03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:42.695
AND LOSS OF MEMORY. ON TOP OF

03:50:42.762 --> 03:50:44.096
NOT BEING ABLE TO HANG PICTURES

03:50:44.163 --> 03:50:45.731
IN THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE THE WELL

03:50:45.798 --> 03:50:46.866
NEXT TO THEIR HOME MAKES THEIR

03:50:46.933 --> 03:50:48.968
HOUSE SHAKE SO MUCH. THESE

03:50:49.035 --> 03:50:49.902
DEVASTATING IMPACTS ARE REAL

03:50:49.969 --> 03:50:50.736
AND THEY ARE PREVENTABLE. ON

03:50:50.803 --> 03:50:51.871
THE NEXT SLIDE, YOU'LL SEE THAT

03:50:51.938 --> 03:50:54.240
TWO YEARS AGO, KSJO BEGAN AN

03:50:54.307 --> 03:50:55.641
INSPECTION PROGRAM TO LOOK FOR

03:50:55.708 --> 03:50:57.643
LEAKS FROM OIL AND GAS

03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:58.811
INFRASTRUCTURE NEAR SCHOOLS AND

03:50:58.878 --> 03:51:00.146
HOMES. A THIRD OF THE

03:51:00.213 --> 03:51:01.581
FACILITIES THAT WE INSPECTED

03:51:01.647 --> 03:51:03.216
WERE LEAKING OF THE LEAKING

03:51:03.282 --> 03:51:04.517
INFRASTRUCTURE. ONE THIRD OF

03:51:04.584 --> 03:51:06.219
THE INFRASTRUCTURE DID NOT HAVE

03:51:06.285 --> 03:51:07.687
TO MAKE REPAIRS BECAUSE OF

03:51:07.753 --> 03:51:09.522
LOOPHOLES IN CALIFORNIA'S OIL

03:51:09.589 --> 03:51:10.623
AND GAS REGULATION, KNOWN AS

03:51:10.690 --> 03:51:12.725
COGGER. THE HEAVY OIL EXEMPTION

03:51:12.792 --> 03:51:13.726
IS ONE SUCH LOOPHOLE THAT

03:51:13.793 --> 03:51:17.196
ALLOWS 70% OF THE WELLS IN

03:51:17.263 --> 03:51:17.930
CALIFORNIA TO AVOID LEAK

03:51:17.997 --> 03:51:19.365
DETECTION AND REPAIR

03:51:19.432 --> 03:51:21.367
REQUIREMENTS. THESE CONDITIONS

03:51:21.434 --> 03:51:22.969
ARE UNACCEPTABLE AS IS, BUT TO

03:51:23.035 --> 03:51:24.737
DRAMATICALLY EXPAND DRILLING

03:51:24.804 --> 03:51:25.871
WITHOUT LIMITS AND WITHOUT

03:51:25.938 --> 03:51:27.039
REDUCING OUR EXPOSURE TO

03:51:27.106 --> 03:51:29.675
EMISSIONS IS MISGUIDED. ON THE

03:51:29.742 --> 03:51:30.910
NEXT SLIDE, YOU'LL SEE THAT

03:51:30.977 --> 03:51:33.346
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE BECAUSE

03:51:33.412 --> 03:51:35.982
THE EXPANSION WON'T BRING THE

03:51:36.048 --> 03:51:36.682
SUPPLY BENEFITS THAT THE

03:51:36.749 --> 03:51:38.784
LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING FOR. FOR

03:51:38.851 --> 03:51:41.420
EXAMPLE, WHEN KERN COUNTY. AND

03:51:41.487 --> 03:51:43.055
THIS SLIDE WILL DEMONSTRATE

03:51:43.122 --> 03:51:44.924
THIS WHEN KERN COUNTY HAD THE

03:51:44.991 --> 03:51:46.158
GREEN LIGHT TO ISSUE DRILLING

03:51:46.225 --> 03:51:48.160
PERMITS FROM 2015 TO 2020,

03:51:48.227 --> 03:51:48.794
PRODUCTION STILL DECLINED YEAR

03:51:48.861 --> 03:51:51.731
TO YEAR. AND ON THE NEXT SLIDE,

03:51:51.797 --> 03:51:53.432
WE CAN SEE THAT THE DECLINE IN

03:51:53.499 --> 03:51:54.500
CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION IS A

03:51:54.567 --> 03:51:56.669
DECLINE OF OVER 40 YEARS, NOT

03:51:56.736 --> 03:51:57.937
BECAUSE OF REGULATIONS THAT ARE

03:51:58.004 --> 03:52:00.006
MEANT TO KEEP ME AND MY FAMILY

03:52:00.072 --> 03:52:01.941
SAFE. IT IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

03:52:02.008 --> 03:52:03.542
OIL FIELDS ARE BEING DEPLETED,

03:52:03.609 --> 03:52:04.777
AND THEY PRODUCE SOME OF THE

03:52:04.844 --> 03:52:06.779
HEAVIEST OIL ANYWHERE IN THE

03:52:06.846 --> 03:52:07.780
WORLD, AS YOU CAN SEE HERE IN

03:52:07.847 --> 03:52:10.850
THE NEXT SLIDE. IN THIS SLIDE,

03:52:10.916 --> 03:52:12.918
YOU CAN SEE THE CARBON

03:52:12.985 --> 03:52:14.687
INTENSITY INDEX THAT'S MADE BY

03:52:14.754 --> 03:52:16.088
CARB. THE AVERAGE INTENSITY IS

03:52:16.155 --> 03:52:18.658
ABOUT 12.5 FOR OIL FIELDS.

03:52:18.724 --> 03:52:20.793
THERE'S OIL FIELDS IN IRAQ,

03:52:20.860 --> 03:52:24.463
IRAN, COLOMBIA, KUWAIT WHERE

03:52:24.530 --> 03:52:25.965
THEIR AVERAGE IS 11.78. AND YOU

03:52:26.032 --> 03:52:27.767
CAN SEE THAT FIELDS IN KERN

03:52:27.833 --> 03:52:29.635
COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA GO UP TO

03:52:29.702 --> 03:52:32.938
48, 38, 24 TWICE, SOMETIMES

03:52:33.005 --> 03:52:35.007
EVEN THREE TIMES AS CARBON

03:52:35.074 --> 03:52:36.442
INTENSE AS OTHER PLACES, EVEN

03:52:36.509 --> 03:52:38.210
IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE

03:52:38.277 --> 03:52:39.578
INDUSTRY IS TURNING TO

03:52:39.645 --> 03:52:41.180
INCREASINGLY EXTREME AND

03:52:41.247 --> 03:52:42.782
POLLUTION AND POLLUTING

03:52:42.848 --> 03:52:43.683
TECHNIQUES TO EXTRACT EVERY

03:52:43.749 --> 03:52:45.818
LAST DROP OF THIS HEAVY OIL,

03:52:45.885 --> 03:52:48.020
ALL WHILE LEAVING LEAKING OIL

03:52:48.087 --> 03:52:48.621
WELLS BEHIND FOR TAXPAYERS TO

03:52:48.688 --> 03:52:50.790
CLEAN UP AND FOR ME IN MY

03:52:50.856 --> 03:52:51.924
COMMUNITY, TO BE EXPOSED. ON

03:52:51.991 --> 03:52:53.192
THE NEXT SLIDE, YOU'LL SEE THAT

03:52:53.259 --> 03:52:54.760
WE'VE SUBMITTED A LETTER WITH

03:52:54.827 --> 03:52:55.361
MULTIPLE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

03:52:55.428 --> 03:52:57.029
YOU MAY HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU

03:52:57.096 --> 03:52:58.264
THAT CAN BETTER PROTECT

03:52:58.331 --> 03:52:58.864
FRONTLINE RESIDENTS FROM ALL

03:52:58.931 --> 03:53:01.500
AND ALL CALIFORNIANS. ON THE

03:53:01.567 --> 03:53:03.669
NEXT SLIDE, WE'LL DEMONSTRATE

03:53:03.736 --> 03:53:04.904
THAT FOREMOST, TO PROTECT

03:53:04.970 --> 03:53:06.138
EXTRACTION COMMUNITIES, THERE

03:53:06.205 --> 03:53:08.007
SHOULD BE NO SEQUEL EXEMPTION

03:53:08.074 --> 03:53:09.709
FOR OIL AND GAS DRILLING

03:53:09.775 --> 03:53:12.778
STATEWIDE AND FOR KERN COUNTY,

03:53:12.845 --> 03:53:13.879
IF THE STATE IS GOING TO

03:53:13.946 --> 03:53:15.548
PROTECT THE INDUSTRY FROM

03:53:15.614 --> 03:53:16.816
LITIGATION, THEN IT SHOULD BE

03:53:16.882 --> 03:53:18.884
CONTINGENT ON THE STATE BEING

03:53:18.951 --> 03:53:21.020
ABLE TO ENFORCE SETBACK

03:53:21.087 --> 03:53:21.854
REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS THAT

03:53:21.921 --> 03:53:23.889
ARE CURRENTLY BEING ATTACKED BY

03:53:23.956 --> 03:53:27.093
THE INDUSTRY IN COURT. AND JUST

03:53:27.159 --> 03:53:27.993
TODAY, A JUDGE DENIED THE

03:53:28.060 --> 03:53:29.895
STATE'S REQUEST TO DISMISS. SO

03:53:29.962 --> 03:53:31.931
THE THREAT IS REAL AND THE

03:53:31.997 --> 03:53:33.733
THREAT IS LOOMING. THERE SHOULD

03:53:33.799 --> 03:53:35.701
ALSO BE A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER

03:53:35.768 --> 03:53:37.036
OF WELLS, SO THAT WE KNOW THAT

03:53:37.103 --> 03:53:39.071
THE NEW OIL PRODUCE IS TIED TO

03:53:39.138 --> 03:53:40.106
SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS, AND NOT

03:53:40.172 --> 03:53:41.540
JUST TO KEEP BIG OIL

03:53:41.607 --> 03:53:42.875
BILLIONAIRES RICHER. THERE MUST

03:53:42.942 --> 03:53:44.777
BE ACTIONS TO REDUCE OIL AND

03:53:44.844 --> 03:53:46.912
GAS EMISSION EXPOSURES THAT ME

03:53:46.979 --> 03:53:49.548
AND MY COMMUNITIES ALREADY FACE,

03:53:49.615 --> 03:53:51.617
SUCH AS THE REPEAL OF THE HEAVY

03:53:51.684 --> 03:53:53.119
OIL EXEMPTION IN COGGER. ON THE

03:53:53.185 --> 03:53:56.555
NEXT SLIDE, I'LL REFER YOU TO

03:53:56.622 --> 03:53:57.957
THE LETTER WHERE WE OUTLINE

03:53:58.023 --> 03:53:59.592
SEVERAL SOLUTIONS THAT WE'D

03:53:59.658 --> 03:54:00.826
LIKE TO EXPLORE IN PARTNERSHIP

03:54:00.893 --> 03:54:03.028
WITH THE LEGISLATION,

03:54:03.095 --> 03:54:03.863
ESPECIALLY PROTECTIONS FOR

03:54:03.929 --> 03:54:06.065
COASTAL COMMUNITIES, REFINING

03:54:06.132 --> 03:54:06.699
COMMUNITIES IN ADDITION TO THE

03:54:06.766 --> 03:54:08.834
EXTRACTION COMMUNITIES. ON THE

03:54:08.901 --> 03:54:10.703
NEXT SLIDE, I'D LIKE TO

03:54:10.770 --> 03:54:12.505
HIGHLIGHT HIGHLIGHT BEFORE I

03:54:12.571 --> 03:54:14.640
CLOSE AND RETURN TO THE BIG

03:54:14.707 --> 03:54:16.742
PICTURE THAT OUR COALITION

03:54:16.809 --> 03:54:17.943
RECOGNIZES THAT THE VALERO

03:54:18.010 --> 03:54:19.645
CLOSURE ANNOUNCEMENT CREATES A

03:54:19.712 --> 03:54:22.314
POTENTIAL SUPPLY CRUNCH, BUT WE

03:54:22.381 --> 03:54:23.649
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE

03:54:23.716 --> 03:54:25.718
TRANSITION OR THE MANAGED

03:54:25.785 --> 03:54:26.652
TRANSITION DOES NOT MEAN THAT

03:54:26.719 --> 03:54:28.621
WE HAVE TO SLOW WALK OUR

03:54:28.687 --> 03:54:30.055
CLIMATE GOALS OR OUR AIR

03:54:30.122 --> 03:54:31.590
QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. THE

03:54:31.657 --> 03:54:33.125
INDUSTRY IS STARTING TO CLOSE

03:54:33.192 --> 03:54:33.726
REFINERIES WORLDWIDE, EVEN IN

03:54:33.793 --> 03:54:36.362
PLACES LIKE TEXAS, NOT BECAUSE

03:54:36.429 --> 03:54:36.962
OF CALIFORNIA'S REGULATIONS,

03:54:37.029 --> 03:54:38.631
BUT BECAUSE GLOBAL DEMAND IS

03:54:38.697 --> 03:54:40.633
BEGINNING TO DECLINE WHEN IT

03:54:40.699 --> 03:54:43.235
COMES TO IN-STATE EXTRACTION.

03:54:43.302 --> 03:54:44.069
THE TRUTH IS THAT CALIFORNIA

03:54:44.136 --> 03:54:46.105
OIL PRODUCTION IS IS IN ITS

03:54:46.172 --> 03:54:47.773
FINAL CHAPTER, AND THE FOSSIL

03:54:47.840 --> 03:54:48.874
FUEL INDUSTRY IS LEAVING A

03:54:48.941 --> 03:54:49.942
LEGACY OF DESTRUCTION IN ITS

03:54:50.009 --> 03:54:52.411
WAKE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE

03:54:52.478 --> 03:54:54.647
NEXT SLIDE. WHAT WE SEE HERE IS

03:54:54.713 --> 03:54:56.882
SATELLITE IMAGING AND DATA THAT

03:54:56.949 --> 03:54:58.751
IS SPECIFIC TO THE OIL AND GAS

03:54:58.818 --> 03:55:00.786
SECTOR ON CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS

03:55:00.853 --> 03:55:03.088
FROM OIL AND GAS. WE HAVE OVER

03:55:03.155 --> 03:55:05.791
400 LEAKS, MORE THAN ANY OTHER

03:55:05.858 --> 03:55:07.159
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY ANYWHERE IN

03:55:07.226 --> 03:55:08.127
THE WORLD, AND WE'RE COMPARABLE

03:55:08.194 --> 03:55:08.861
TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE MIDDLE

03:55:08.928 --> 03:55:10.796
EAST WHEN IT COMES TO OUR

03:55:10.863 --> 03:55:12.531
ABILITY TO NOT CONTROL

03:55:12.598 --> 03:55:13.799
EMISSIONS FROM THE OIL AND GAS

03:55:13.866 --> 03:55:16.669
SECTOR. I'D LIKE TO END OFF ON

03:55:16.735 --> 03:55:18.704
THE NEXT SLIDE BY SAYING THAT

03:55:18.771 --> 03:55:19.939
TO TRULY PROTECT US FROM RISING

03:55:20.005 --> 03:55:21.740
GAS PRICES, WE NEED A HOLISTIC

03:55:21.807 --> 03:55:23.709
MANAGED TRANSITION PLAN LIKE

03:55:23.776 --> 03:55:24.977
BUCKET THREE THAT WAS SHOWN

03:55:25.044 --> 03:55:26.445
EARLIER AND CONTINUED PROGRESS

03:55:26.512 --> 03:55:28.881
ON REDUCING DEMAND. WE NEED TO

03:55:28.948 --> 03:55:31.317
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:55:31.383 --> 03:55:31.784
REMAINING OIL AND GAS

03:55:31.851 --> 03:55:33.752
EXTRACTION IS DONE IN A WAY

03:55:33.819 --> 03:55:34.720
THAT IS PROTECTIVE TO MY

03:55:34.787 --> 03:55:37.022
COMMUNITY, AND WE NEED TO MAKE

03:55:37.089 --> 03:55:38.524
STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

03:55:38.591 --> 03:55:39.692
NEVER IN A POSITION OF BEING

03:55:39.758 --> 03:55:42.061
SHAKEN DOWN BY THE OIL INDUSTRY

03:55:42.127 --> 03:55:43.028
EVER AGAIN. AND BY ADDRESSING

03:55:43.095 --> 03:55:43.762
THESE ISSUES, YOU'LL HAVE

03:55:43.829 --> 03:55:45.931
PROTECT PEOPLE LIKE ME, PEOPLE

03:55:45.998 --> 03:55:46.966
IN MY COMMUNITY, AND ENSURE

03:55:47.032 --> 03:55:48.567
THAT THE STATE ISN'T HELD

03:55:48.634 --> 03:55:49.668
HOSTAGE. THE NEXT TIME A

03:55:49.735 --> 03:55:51.170
REFINERY ANNOUNCES THAT THEY

03:55:51.237 --> 03:55:54.673
WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU.

03:55:54.740 --> 03:55:58.244
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

03:55:58.310 --> 03:56:00.880
TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS.

03:56:00.946 --> 03:56:01.580
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

03:56:01.647 --> 03:56:05.284
MEMBERS. CHAIR BRIAN. SO FIRST,

03:56:05.351 --> 03:56:06.085
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE. THIS

03:56:06.151 --> 03:56:07.653
WASN'T DONE INTENTIONALLY, BUT

03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:10.656
I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO

03:56:10.723 --> 03:56:11.690
HAVE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION

03:56:11.757 --> 03:56:14.226
THAT TRAVELED UP. BE THE LAST

03:56:14.293 --> 03:56:17.463
PERSON TO TESTIFY TODAY, IT

03:56:17.530 --> 03:56:21.767
SEEMS. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IS

03:56:21.834 --> 03:56:23.636
KIND OF A CONSISTENT THEME IN

03:56:23.702 --> 03:56:25.604
THIS PROCESS OF LAWMAKING TO

03:56:25.671 --> 03:56:27.673
PUT COMMUNITY LAST. AND I JUST

03:56:27.740 --> 03:56:28.874
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOUR

03:56:28.941 --> 03:56:30.643
TESTIMONY WAS POWERFUL, HEARD

03:56:30.709 --> 03:56:31.911
AND MADE A TREMENDOUS

03:56:31.977 --> 03:56:33.879
DIFFERENCE TODAY. I THINK IT'S

03:56:33.946 --> 03:56:36.015
IMPORTANT IN THIS PROCESS THAT

03:56:36.081 --> 03:56:37.316
WE CODIFY AND BOLSTER AND

03:56:37.383 --> 03:56:38.951
PROTECT THE WORK OF 1137 AND

03:56:39.018 --> 03:56:41.086
THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TO END

03:56:41.153 --> 03:56:42.855
NEIGHBORHOOD DRILLING NOW AND

03:56:42.922 --> 03:56:44.189
GOING FORWARD, AND THAT NOTHING

03:56:44.256 --> 03:56:45.791
IN THIS PROCESS SHOULD DO

03:56:45.858 --> 03:56:47.593
ANYTHING BUT PROTECT THAT, IN

03:56:47.660 --> 03:56:49.562
MY OPINION. AND I WANT TO THANK

03:56:49.628 --> 03:56:50.996
YOU FOR RAISING THAT. I DON'T

03:56:51.063 --> 03:56:51.797
ACTUALLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I

03:56:51.864 --> 03:56:54.366
JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

03:56:54.433 --> 03:56:54.967
THAT WE APPRECIATE YOU. THANK

03:56:55.034 --> 03:56:57.903
YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

03:56:57.970 --> 03:56:59.805
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HART YEAH, I

03:56:59.872 --> 03:57:01.807
HAVE A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR

03:57:01.874 --> 03:57:02.875
MARTIN. THE WORK THAT YOU'VE

03:57:02.942 --> 03:57:06.679
DONE TO POINT TO THE CHALLENGE

03:57:06.745 --> 03:57:08.714
OF PRE 2004 CARS, HAVE YOU

03:57:08.781 --> 03:57:09.949
LOOKED AT HOW MANY CARS THAT IS

03:57:10.015 --> 03:57:11.784
IN CALIFORNIA AND, YOU KNOW,

03:57:11.850 --> 03:57:14.153
PLAYED AROUND WITH THE IDEA OF

03:57:14.219 --> 03:57:14.787
INCENTIVES AND WHAT THOSE WOULD

03:57:14.853 --> 03:57:16.655
COST TO BRING A SIGNIFICANT

03:57:16.722 --> 03:57:17.790
NUMBER OF THOSE VEHICLES OFF

03:57:17.856 --> 03:57:20.292
THE ROAD. AND IS THERE A CLIFF

03:57:20.359 --> 03:57:22.761
WITH 2004 WHERE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:57:22.828 --> 03:57:23.896
EMISSIONS REGULATIONS GOT SO

03:57:23.963 --> 03:57:25.831
MUCH BETTER AFTER THAT? OR IS

03:57:25.898 --> 03:57:29.568
IT A GRADUAL SLOPE TO. YEAH,

03:57:29.635 --> 03:57:31.804
GOOD QUESTIONS. SO FIRST I'LL

03:57:31.870 --> 03:57:32.705
SAY THIS THIS WORK THAT I DID

03:57:32.771 --> 03:57:34.974
LOOKING AT THE AIR QUALITY

03:57:35.040 --> 03:57:35.808
TRADE OFFS BETWEEN FUEL AND

03:57:35.874 --> 03:57:37.276
VEHICLES REALLY BUILDS ON WORK

03:57:37.343 --> 03:57:40.045
THAT MY COLLEAGUE DID TOGETHER

03:57:40.112 --> 03:57:40.846
WITH THE GREENLINING INSTITUTE.

03:57:40.913 --> 03:57:42.615
AND THEY'VE DEFINITELY GOT THE

03:57:42.681 --> 03:57:45.117
FACTS AND THE FIGURES ON HOW

03:57:45.184 --> 03:57:45.918
MANY OF THOSE VEHICLES ARE OUT

03:57:45.985 --> 03:57:46.852
THERE, EXACTLY WHAT FRACTION OF

03:57:46.919 --> 03:57:48.554
POLLUTANTS COMES FROM EACH OF

03:57:48.621 --> 03:57:50.022
THOSE. SO I DON'T HAVE THAT AT

03:57:50.089 --> 03:57:51.090
MY FINGERTIPS, BUT I'LL

03:57:51.156 --> 03:57:52.691
DEFINITELY GET THAT TO YOU. I

03:57:52.758 --> 03:57:54.793
DID HAVE IN THE SLIDES, WHICH I

03:57:54.860 --> 03:57:55.761
DON'T THINK EVER MADE IT UP ON

03:57:55.828 --> 03:57:57.696
THE SCREEN, BUT PERHAPS YOU

03:57:57.763 --> 03:57:59.198
HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU A CHART

03:57:59.264 --> 03:58:01.000
SHOWING THE POLLUTANTS SORT OF

03:58:01.066 --> 03:58:04.570
BY POLLUTANTS PER MILE FROM

03:58:04.637 --> 03:58:06.605
DIFFERENT VINTAGES OF CARS. AND

03:58:06.672 --> 03:58:08.007
SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU CAN

03:58:08.073 --> 03:58:10.676
SEE THAT IT IT DOES DECLINE

03:58:10.743 --> 03:58:12.811
PRECIPITOUSLY. IT SORT OF IS A

03:58:12.878 --> 03:58:15.047
STEADY THING. SO, YOU KNOW, I

03:58:15.114 --> 03:58:16.915
THINK 2004, THERE ARE QUITE A

03:58:16.982 --> 03:58:17.983
NUMBER OF THOSE CARS STILL ON

03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:19.585
THE ROAD. THERE WERE BIG

03:58:19.652 --> 03:58:20.753
CHANGES IN EMISSIONS CONTROL

03:58:20.819 --> 03:58:21.854
TECHNOLOGIES AROUND THAT TIME.

03:58:21.920 --> 03:58:23.722
SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD BREAK

03:58:23.789 --> 03:58:27.126
POINT. BUT BUT YOU KNOW, THE

03:58:27.192 --> 03:58:28.861
NEWEST CARS ARE CLEANER THAN

03:58:28.927 --> 03:58:32.498
THAN CARS THAT ARE 15 YEARS OLD

03:58:32.564 --> 03:58:35.868
AND 25 YEARS OLD IS EVEN WORSE.

03:58:35.934 --> 03:58:40.539
YEAH. AND SO I THINK THE. YEAH,

03:58:40.606 --> 03:58:43.008
IT THERE'S A THERE'S QUITE A

03:58:43.075 --> 03:58:45.077
NUMBER OF THEM ON THE ROAD. SO

03:58:45.144 --> 03:58:46.979
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT

03:58:47.046 --> 03:58:48.781
FIGURES BUT THANK YOU. YEAH.

03:58:48.847 --> 03:58:51.850
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELLIS. YES. THE

03:58:51.917 --> 03:58:52.951
YOUNG MAN THAT JUST TESTIFIED

03:58:53.018 --> 03:58:58.323
THERE. THE LAST QUESTION. WHEN

03:58:58.390 --> 03:59:00.592
YOU SHOWED THAT SLIDE WITH ALL

03:59:00.659 --> 03:59:04.997
OF THE YELLOW IN THE RED, WERE

03:59:05.064 --> 03:59:11.537
THOSE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. THAT'S

03:59:11.603 --> 03:59:14.273
REGIONAL AIR QUALITY THAT'S

03:59:14.339 --> 03:59:18.043
PRODUCED BY THE EPA? NO, BUT

03:59:18.110 --> 03:59:20.012
WHAT CAUSED THAT WERE THOSE

03:59:20.079 --> 03:59:21.980
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS?

03:59:22.047 --> 03:59:23.615
IT'S PM 2.5 AND A LOT OF THE

03:59:23.682 --> 03:59:25.050
PARTICULATE MATTER, A LOT OF

03:59:25.117 --> 03:59:26.952
THE PM 2.5 DOES COME FROM OIL

03:59:27.019 --> 03:59:28.721
AND GAS. OKAY. SO ARE YOU

03:59:28.787 --> 03:59:31.757
SAYING THAT THAT COULD HAVE

03:59:31.824 --> 03:59:37.062
BEEN CAUSED BY. PESTICIDES?

03:59:37.129 --> 03:59:38.931
EXCUSE ME? PESTICIDES

03:59:38.997 --> 03:59:39.631
PARTICULATE. WE'RE IN THE

03:59:39.698 --> 03:59:40.999
SOUTHERN END OF THE VALLEY

03:59:41.066 --> 03:59:43.068
WHERE WE COLLECT ALL THAT DUST.

03:59:43.135 --> 03:59:44.603
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT'S

03:59:44.670 --> 03:59:47.139
ALL CAUSED FROM OIL AND GAS?

03:59:47.206 --> 03:59:50.843
THERE IS A LOT OF EXPOSURE THAT

03:59:50.909 --> 03:59:53.612
COMES TO PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL

03:59:53.679 --> 03:59:54.880
VALLEY. BUT THAT'S NOT MY

03:59:54.947 --> 03:59:56.749
QUESTION. RIGHT? RIGHT. BUT MY

03:59:56.815 --> 03:59:58.650
QUESTION IS IT COMING FROM OIL

03:59:58.717 --> 03:59:59.918
AND GAS? UNDERSTOOD. A LOT OF

03:59:59.985 --> 04:00:01.653
IT IS. YES. OKAY. I THINK MUCH

04:00:01.720 --> 04:00:02.788
LIKE THE TOBACCO ARGUMENT OF

04:00:02.855 --> 04:00:04.590
PROVE THAT IT WAS ONLY US OR

04:00:04.656 --> 04:00:06.692
ELSE WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE IS

04:00:06.759 --> 04:00:07.760
PART OF THIS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT

04:00:07.826 --> 04:00:08.861
REID? VAPOR PRESSURE IS? I

04:00:08.927 --> 04:00:10.662
UNDERSTAND FROM MY INSPECTIONS

04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:11.530
AND MY THERMOGRAPHIC

04:00:11.597 --> 04:00:12.698
INSPECTIONS THAT I'VE DONE ON

04:00:12.765 --> 04:00:13.932
OIL WELLS, THAT THERE IS

04:00:13.999 --> 04:00:15.567
EXEMPTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR LEAKS

04:00:15.634 --> 04:00:17.936
TO HAPPEN IN OPEN WELLHEADS,

04:00:18.003 --> 04:00:19.071
AND THAT GOES UNREPORTED AND

04:00:19.138 --> 04:00:20.539
UNMONITORED. IT'S PART OF THE

04:00:20.606 --> 04:00:22.107
REASON THAT WE'RE NOT MEETING

04:00:22.174 --> 04:00:23.342
OUR AIR QUALITY GOALS. AND IT'S

04:00:23.408 --> 04:00:24.777
PART OF THE REASON WHY

04:00:24.843 --> 04:00:25.944
NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS KERN

04:00:26.011 --> 04:00:28.981
COUNTY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, REID?

04:00:29.047 --> 04:00:31.049
VAPOR PRESSURE IS? NO, I WILL

04:00:31.116 --> 04:00:34.753
EXPLAIN, REID. VAPOR PRESSURE

04:00:34.820 --> 04:00:40.058
IS THE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL.

04:00:40.125 --> 04:00:42.661
OKAY. THAT MEANS WHEN DOES IT

04:00:42.728 --> 04:00:45.798
GO TO VAPOR IN KERN COUNTY?

04:00:45.864 --> 04:00:47.766
I'VE BEEN THERE 50 YEARS IN THE

04:00:47.833 --> 04:00:49.668
OIL AND GAS BUSINESS. OUR OIL

04:00:49.735 --> 04:00:51.737
COMES OUT OF THE GROUND. WHY DO

04:00:51.804 --> 04:00:54.039
YOU THINK WE HEAT THE

04:00:54.106 --> 04:00:54.640
RESERVOIRS? BECAUSE THE REID

04:00:54.706 --> 04:00:56.775
VAPOR PRESSURE IS LOW. IT WILL

04:00:56.842 --> 04:00:59.478
NOT EMIT. SO. SO WE COME BACK

04:00:59.545 --> 04:01:02.881
TO MY QUESTION. WAS THAT YELLOW

04:01:02.948 --> 04:01:04.550
AND ORANGE BALL TO ORGANIC

04:01:04.616 --> 04:01:07.820
COMPOUNDS DERIVED FROM OIL? I

04:01:07.886 --> 04:01:09.121
DON'T THINK IT WAS SOLELY

04:01:09.188 --> 04:01:10.956
DERIVED FROM OIL, BUT A LOT OF

04:01:11.023 --> 04:01:12.057
THE STATIONARY SOURCES DO

04:01:12.124 --> 04:01:13.392
PRODUCE PM 2.5, AND THEY ARE

04:01:13.458 --> 04:01:14.159
ASSOCIATED WITH OIL AND GAS

04:01:14.226 --> 04:01:17.229
SECTOR PM 2.5. I'M SORRY. RIGHT.

04:01:17.296 --> 04:01:18.630
IS PARTICULATE MATTER RIGHT.

04:01:18.697 --> 04:01:20.766
AND I THINK IF VOLATILE ORGANIC

04:01:20.833 --> 04:01:21.967
COMPOUNDS ARE NOT PARTICULATE

04:01:22.034 --> 04:01:23.635
MATTER. RIGHT. AND I THINK IF

04:01:23.702 --> 04:01:24.970
YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION ON

04:01:25.037 --> 04:01:26.705
VOCS, TOXICS AND OTHER THINGS

04:01:26.772 --> 04:01:28.307
THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING

04:01:28.373 --> 04:01:29.842
FROM OIL AND GAS SITES, SB 1137

04:01:29.908 --> 04:01:31.543
HAS A LOT OF FENCELINE AND

04:01:31.610 --> 04:01:32.778
ENGINEER CONTROLS THAT ARE

04:01:32.845 --> 04:01:34.813
GOING TO BE IN EXTRACTION SITES

04:01:34.880 --> 04:01:35.814
INSIDE OF THE HEALTH PROTECTION

04:01:35.881 --> 04:01:37.816
ZONES. SO BY PROTECTING SB 1137

04:01:37.883 --> 04:01:39.885
AND MAKING SURE THAT IT'S

04:01:39.952 --> 04:01:41.053
PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED, WE WILL

04:01:41.119 --> 04:01:41.787
HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON VOCS

04:01:41.854 --> 04:01:44.690
AND NOT JUST TRACK METHANE AS A

04:01:44.756 --> 04:01:46.558
CLIMATE PROBLEM, BUT ALSO AS A

04:01:46.625 --> 04:01:47.893
PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY AND

04:01:47.960 --> 04:01:49.061
PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY

04:01:49.127 --> 04:01:50.863
PROBLEM. SO I THINK SB 1137 CAN

04:01:50.929 --> 04:01:52.898
DO A LOT TO TRACK VOCS AT A

04:01:52.965 --> 04:01:54.066
NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL, AND WE NEED

04:01:54.132 --> 04:01:55.634
BETTER MONITORING IN CALIFORNIA

04:01:55.701 --> 04:01:57.069
IN ORDER TO FIND THAT OUT. I'M

04:01:57.135 --> 04:01:58.637
SORRY, BUT YOUR DELIVERY IS

04:01:58.704 --> 04:01:59.838
INCORRECT. THANK YOU. OKAY.

04:01:59.905 --> 04:02:02.608
THANK YOU. AS EVERYONE CAN TELL,

04:02:02.674 --> 04:02:04.743
WE HAVE A VERY DIVERSE SET OF

04:02:04.810 --> 04:02:06.578
PERSPECTIVES ON OUR OUR FINAL

04:02:06.645 --> 04:02:12.251
PANEL. MR. OR DOCTOR MARTIN,

04:02:12.317 --> 04:02:15.053
YOU OPENED YOUR COMMENTS

04:02:15.120 --> 04:02:17.556
OUTLINING AN ALTERNATIVE

04:02:17.623 --> 04:02:19.024
PROPOSAL OR A COMPLEMENTARY

04:02:19.091 --> 04:02:21.793
PROPOSAL RELATED TO ALLOWING

04:02:21.860 --> 04:02:23.729
FOR THE IMPORTATION OF

04:02:23.795 --> 04:02:26.665
NON-CARBON FUELS FOR A FEE THAT

04:02:26.732 --> 04:02:28.934
WILL THEN BE UTILIZED TO

04:02:29.001 --> 04:02:30.135
INCENTIVIZE ELECTRIFICATION.

04:02:30.202 --> 04:02:32.604
I'M VERY CURIOUS TO GET THE

04:02:32.671 --> 04:02:35.440
REACTION FROM THIS DIVERSE SET

04:02:35.507 --> 04:02:37.142
OF PANELS, PANELISTS TO THAT

04:02:37.209 --> 04:02:38.677
PROPOSAL. I DON'T KNOW WHO

04:02:38.744 --> 04:02:40.913
WANTS TO START. MR. AGUIRRE, DO

04:02:40.979 --> 04:02:43.749
YOU WANT TO LET US WHAT'S YOUR

04:02:43.815 --> 04:02:46.118
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

04:02:46.184 --> 04:02:47.986
DOCTOR MARTENS AND THE UNION OF

04:02:48.053 --> 04:02:49.955
CONCERNED SCIENTISTS SUGGESTION

04:02:50.022 --> 04:02:51.823
REGARDING THE NON CARBON FUEL?

04:02:51.890 --> 04:02:54.259
YEAH, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT

04:02:54.326 --> 04:02:55.961
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FIND AS

04:02:56.028 --> 04:02:57.629
MANY ALTERNATIVES AS POSSIBLE,

04:02:57.696 --> 04:02:59.865
BECAUSE THE DEPENDENCY ON THIS

04:02:59.932 --> 04:03:01.466
AND THE LACK OF ALTERNATIVES

04:03:01.533 --> 04:03:03.302
HAS LED US INTO THE HOLE THAT

04:03:03.368 --> 04:03:05.237
WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. AND SO I

04:03:05.304 --> 04:03:07.105
THINK MAKING SURE THAT SOME OF

04:03:07.172 --> 04:03:07.940
SOME CREATIVE ALTERNATIVES THAT

04:03:08.006 --> 04:03:10.309
CAN MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A

04:03:10.375 --> 04:03:11.543
PATH FORWARD TO LESSEN OUR

04:03:11.610 --> 04:03:12.144
DEPENDENCY AND MAKE SURE THAT

04:03:12.210 --> 04:03:13.845
ALTERNATIVES CAN HAVE MORE

04:03:13.912 --> 04:03:15.180
MONEY, MORE FUNDING, MORE

04:03:15.247 --> 04:03:15.747
INTENTIONALITY TO MAKE SURE

04:03:15.814 --> 04:03:17.950
THAT WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES,

04:03:18.016 --> 04:03:18.951
AGAIN, YOU KNOW, IN THIS

04:03:19.017 --> 04:03:19.851
POSITION IN SIX MONTHS, PLAYING

04:03:19.918 --> 04:03:21.920
WHACK A MOLE. I THINK MAYBE YOU

04:03:21.987 --> 04:03:24.189
WERE THE ONE THAT THAT SAID WE

04:03:24.256 --> 04:03:24.756
SHOULDN'T BE PLAYING WHACK A

04:03:24.823 --> 04:03:26.825
MOLE WITH THIS. I THINK MAKING

04:03:26.892 --> 04:03:27.859
SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE

04:03:27.926 --> 04:03:29.127
ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS IS

04:03:29.194 --> 04:03:30.095
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW,

04:03:30.162 --> 04:03:30.963
SOME OF THE BIGGEST SPENDERS IN

04:03:31.029 --> 04:03:32.664
CALIFORNIA, LEGISLATURE DIDN'T

04:03:32.731 --> 04:03:33.632
SPEND THEIR MONEY TO ATTACK

04:03:33.699 --> 04:03:34.766
ELECTRIFICATION OR REGULATIONS

04:03:34.833 --> 04:03:35.767
THAT PROTECT WORKERS AND

04:03:35.834 --> 04:03:37.569
COMMUNITIES AT THESE OIL AND

04:03:37.636 --> 04:03:39.004
GAS SITES, WE WOULD BE MUCH

04:03:39.071 --> 04:03:40.105
FURTHER AND MUCH LESS DEPENDENT

04:03:40.172 --> 04:03:44.142
THAN WE ARE NOW. AS FAR AS THE

04:03:44.209 --> 04:03:45.277
AS FAR AS THE REFINERY,

04:03:45.344 --> 04:03:46.011
PROPRIETARY REFINERY WORKERS,

04:03:46.078 --> 04:03:46.878
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A SLIPPERY

04:03:46.945 --> 04:03:49.147
SLOPE. WE'VE BEEN HAVING THESE

04:03:49.214 --> 04:03:50.983
CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW

04:03:51.049 --> 04:03:52.184
MONTHS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

04:03:52.250 --> 04:03:53.685
THEIR UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY

04:03:53.752 --> 04:03:55.554
THAT WOULD MEAN IS THERE IS IS

04:03:55.620 --> 04:03:57.055
THERE ENOUGH DISINCENTIVE JUST

04:03:57.122 --> 04:03:58.757
TO HAVE REFINERY SHUT DOWN AND

04:03:58.824 --> 04:04:00.726
JUST IMPORT FUELS AND THEN

04:04:00.792 --> 04:04:02.828
LEAVE COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED?

04:04:02.894 --> 04:04:05.263
YOU KNOW, OUR MEMBERS WHO LIVE

04:04:05.330 --> 04:04:06.398
IN THOSE COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES

04:04:06.465 --> 04:04:07.933
DEVASTATED AS WELL AS STILL NO

04:04:08.000 --> 04:04:09.801
PLAN, LIKE REAL TRANSITION PLAN

04:04:09.868 --> 04:04:12.237
FOR ANY OF THOSE WORKERS OR THE

04:04:12.304 --> 04:04:13.071
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT HAPPENS.

04:04:13.138 --> 04:04:14.706
SO I THINK FOR YEARS WE'VE

04:04:14.773 --> 04:04:17.142
WE'VE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE WORKED

04:04:17.209 --> 04:04:17.776
IN PARTNERSHIP IN CREATING SOME

04:04:17.843 --> 04:04:19.678
OF THE, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE

04:04:19.745 --> 04:04:20.846
REGULATIONS AND THE SAFETY

04:04:20.912 --> 04:04:21.847
REGULATIONS IN PARTICULAR IN

04:04:21.913 --> 04:04:23.682
THIS STATE TO ENSURE THAT OUR

04:04:23.749 --> 04:04:24.950
OUR REFINERIES DO OPERATE THAT

04:04:25.017 --> 04:04:27.119
WAY. AND PART OF THAT IS THE

04:04:27.185 --> 04:04:28.620
ENERGY ISLAND THAT CALIFORNIA

04:04:28.687 --> 04:04:30.522
HAS BEEN ON AND THE HOW HARD IT

04:04:30.589 --> 04:04:32.257
IS AND OR HOW MUCH MORE

04:04:32.324 --> 04:04:33.925
EXPENSIVE IT WOULD BE TO IMPORT

04:04:33.992 --> 04:04:35.227
FINISHED PRODUCTS. BUT IT'S

04:04:35.293 --> 04:04:36.661
OBVIOUSLY A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

04:04:36.728 --> 04:04:37.562
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE CONTINUED

04:04:37.629 --> 04:04:38.930
TO HAVE DIALOG WITH. AND I

04:04:38.997 --> 04:04:40.565
THINK THE THE DEVIL WILL BE IN

04:04:40.632 --> 04:04:43.068
THE DETAILS TO, TO MAKE SURE

04:04:43.135 --> 04:04:45.237
THAT IT'S NOT THAT IT DOESN'T

04:04:45.303 --> 04:04:47.806
GO FROM A QUICK FIX TO KIND OF

04:04:47.873 --> 04:04:49.107
COVER A CURRENT SITUATION THAT

04:04:49.174 --> 04:04:50.742
ENDS UP IN A SLOPE, THAT ENDS

04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:51.943
UP WITH US, WITH NO REFINING

04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:53.879
SECTOR AT ALL IN THE STATE.

04:04:53.945 --> 04:04:56.715
THANK YOU, MR. LEARY. THANK YOU.

04:04:56.782 --> 04:04:58.050
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

04:04:58.116 --> 04:04:59.618
TO RESPOND. I THINK I WOULD

04:04:59.684 --> 04:05:02.821
HAVE TO URGE EXTREME CAUTION ON

04:05:02.888 --> 04:05:07.492
ALLOWING IMPORTED NON-CARBON

04:05:07.559 --> 04:05:11.329
FUEL THAT COULD PUT OUR

04:05:11.396 --> 04:05:13.165
REFINERS AT A SERIOUS

04:05:13.231 --> 04:05:14.800
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. OUR

04:05:14.866 --> 04:05:17.969
REFINERS HAVE MADE THE A

04:05:18.036 --> 04:05:19.871
TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT INTO

04:05:19.938 --> 04:05:22.541
THEIR REFINERIES TO MAKE CAR

04:05:22.607 --> 04:05:25.010
BOB IN THE 90S. AND WHEN WE DID

04:05:25.077 --> 04:05:27.145
THE SWITCH, A LOT OF REFINERIES

04:05:27.212 --> 04:05:29.047
DIDN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE THEY

04:05:29.114 --> 04:05:31.083
COULDN'T MAKE THE INVESTMENT TO

04:05:31.149 --> 04:05:33.819
UPGRADE TO THE CAR. BOB

04:05:33.885 --> 04:05:35.987
SPECIFICATIONS. A LOT OF MY

04:05:36.054 --> 04:05:37.656
MEMBER COMPANIES OR EVERYONE

04:05:37.722 --> 04:05:39.624
OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA IS

04:05:39.691 --> 04:05:43.195
MAKING CAR BOB, AND THAT WAS A

04:05:43.261 --> 04:05:44.663
SERIOUS INVESTMENT. AND IF YOU

04:05:44.729 --> 04:05:48.200
START ALLOWING OTHER FUEL

04:05:48.266 --> 04:05:50.669
SPECIFICATIONS COMING IN FROM

04:05:50.735 --> 04:05:51.937
REFINERIES ACROSS THE WORLD

04:05:52.003 --> 04:05:53.538
THAT AREN'T MAKING CAR BOB,

04:05:53.605 --> 04:05:55.807
THEY'RE MAKING, YOU KNOW,

04:05:55.874 --> 04:05:57.709
REFORMULATED GASOLINE, THEY'RE

04:05:57.776 --> 04:05:59.811
NOT SUBJECT TO THE CAP AND

04:05:59.878 --> 04:06:00.979
TRADE PROGRAM. THEY'RE NOT

04:06:01.046 --> 04:06:02.614
SUBJECT TO AIR DISTRICT

04:06:02.681 --> 04:06:03.715
REGULATIONS. THEY'RE NOT

04:06:03.782 --> 04:06:05.517
SUBJECT TO THE LABOR LAWS IN

04:06:05.584 --> 04:06:08.086
CALIFORNIA. THEIR THEIR COSTS

04:06:08.153 --> 04:06:09.588
ARE JUST MUCH DIFFERENT THAN

04:06:09.654 --> 04:06:11.957
OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. SO I

04:06:12.023 --> 04:06:12.891
WOULD JUST URGE EXTREME CAUTION

04:06:12.958 --> 04:06:15.160
ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF

04:06:15.227 --> 04:06:20.398
CALIFORNIA REFINERIES. THANK

04:06:20.465 --> 04:06:23.268
YOU. TO JUST CLARIFY TWO THINGS.

04:06:23.335 --> 04:06:26.838
ONE IS THE IDEA IS NOT TO FOCUS

04:06:26.905 --> 04:06:28.640
SO MUCH ON IMPORTS. IT'S

04:06:28.707 --> 04:06:29.808
FLEXIBILITY TO USE GASOLINE

04:06:29.875 --> 04:06:31.776
THAT'S AVAILABLE WHEN THERE'S A

04:06:31.843 --> 04:06:33.245
SHORTAGE. AND ACTUALLY SOME OF

04:06:33.311 --> 04:06:34.579
THE GASOLINE THAT MIGHT BE

04:06:34.646 --> 04:06:37.449
AVAILABLE AND NOT BE CAR BOB

04:06:37.516 --> 04:06:38.550
COULD BE CALIFORNIA PRODUCED

04:06:38.617 --> 04:06:41.086
GASOLINE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE

04:06:41.153 --> 04:06:42.053
CALIFORNIA REFINERIES PRODUCE

04:06:42.120 --> 04:06:42.654
DIFFERENT GRADES OF GASOLINE.

04:06:42.721 --> 04:06:45.290
SO REALLY THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN

04:06:45.357 --> 04:06:48.026
YOU HAVE A SHORTAGE, YOU YOU

04:06:48.093 --> 04:06:48.860
LOOK AT WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND

04:06:48.927 --> 04:06:50.829
YOU HAVE MORE OPTIONS AND MORE

04:06:50.896 --> 04:06:51.730
FLEXIBILITY. AND I THINK THAT'S

04:06:51.796 --> 04:06:53.598
WHAT WE'RE REALLY AFTER IS, IS

04:06:53.665 --> 04:06:55.367
TO CREATE SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY,

04:06:55.433 --> 04:06:56.101
REALLY IN THE SHORT TERM WHEN

04:06:56.168 --> 04:06:57.869
YOU'RE WHILE YOU'RE. AND THAT

04:06:57.936 --> 04:06:59.771
REALLY SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE

04:06:59.838 --> 04:07:02.040
OF OF THE FEE. I MENTIONED VERY

04:07:02.107 --> 04:07:03.742
BRIEFLY THAT, YOU KNOW, IT

04:07:03.808 --> 04:07:04.676
MIGHT BE TEMPTING THAT, WELL,

04:07:04.743 --> 04:07:06.778
IF YOU HAD A LOWER FEE, THIS

04:07:06.845 --> 04:07:08.013
WOULD BE EVEN BETTER, RIGHT?

04:07:08.079 --> 04:07:09.648
IT'D BE CHEAPER. BUT ACTUALLY,

04:07:09.714 --> 04:07:10.949
I THINK WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE

04:07:11.016 --> 04:07:12.851
FEE, THEN THE CONCERNS THAT

04:07:12.918 --> 04:07:15.120
WERE RAISED HERE WOULD BE MUCH

04:07:15.187 --> 04:07:19.991
MORE REALISTIC. SO WE, YOU KNOW,

04:07:20.058 --> 04:07:22.127
THE NUMBER COULD BE EVALUATED

04:07:22.194 --> 04:07:24.429
MORE. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE

04:07:24.496 --> 04:07:25.897
PROPOSED WAS $0.25. I THINK AT

04:07:25.964 --> 04:07:28.733
THAT LEVEL, THE RISK THAT YOU'D

04:07:28.800 --> 04:07:30.735
BE, YOU KNOW, DRAMATICALLY

04:07:30.802 --> 04:07:32.904
UNDERCUTTING IN-STATE

04:07:32.971 --> 04:07:33.705
PRODUCTION IS QUITE LOW. YOU

04:07:33.772 --> 04:07:35.874
KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

04:07:35.941 --> 04:07:36.808
DIFFERENCE IN, IN THE WHOLESALE

04:07:36.875 --> 04:07:37.909
PRICES OF GASOLINE IN

04:07:37.976 --> 04:07:39.578
CALIFORNIA VERSUS OTHER PLACES,

04:07:39.644 --> 04:07:41.713
$0.25 IS, IS, I THINK, A PRETTY

04:07:41.780 --> 04:07:44.249
SAFE MARGIN. SO, YOU KNOW, I

04:07:44.316 --> 04:07:44.883
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE

04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:45.784
CONCERN AND THE POINTS THAT

04:07:45.850 --> 04:07:47.953
THEY'VE RAISED. BUT WE THINK

04:07:48.019 --> 04:07:49.888
THAT'S, YOU KNOW, PART OF THE

04:07:49.955 --> 04:07:50.755
REASON WHY, YOU KNOW, AN

04:07:50.822 --> 04:07:52.757
APPROPRIATE FEE IS BOTH GOOD

04:07:52.824 --> 04:07:53.892
FOR MITIGATION, BUT IT'S ALSO

04:07:53.959 --> 04:07:54.859
GOOD TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE

04:07:54.926 --> 04:07:56.895
NOT UNINTENTIONALLY

04:07:56.962 --> 04:07:57.996
DESTABILIZING THE THE INDUSTRY

04:07:58.063 --> 04:08:00.932
IN THE STATE. MY UNDERSTANDING

04:08:00.999 --> 04:08:02.634
AND OBVIOUSLY, I THINK TO TO

04:08:02.701 --> 04:08:04.703
BORROW YOUR PHRASE, DEVIL'S IN

04:08:04.769 --> 04:08:06.137
THE DETAIL. MY UNDERSTANDING OF

04:08:06.204 --> 04:08:08.306
THE PROPOSAL IS TO CREATE

04:08:08.373 --> 04:08:08.974
SOMETHING WHERE ON A, ON A

04:08:09.040 --> 04:08:12.110
STEADY STATE BASIS, ACTUALLY

04:08:12.177 --> 04:08:13.678
KABOB WOULD BE THE MORE

04:08:13.745 --> 04:08:16.815
ECONOMICAL CHOICE. BUT IN A

04:08:16.881 --> 04:08:17.782
SUPPLY CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT

04:08:17.849 --> 04:08:20.418
WHERE AS WE'VE SEEN, THAT'S

04:08:20.485 --> 04:08:21.953
WHERE WE SEE HUGE CONSTRAINTS

04:08:22.020 --> 04:08:22.921
THAT A LOT OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND

04:08:22.988 --> 04:08:24.923
LEAD TO HUGE PRICE SPIKES, THAT

04:08:24.990 --> 04:08:26.758
THEN THAT WOULD BE SORT OF THIS

04:08:26.825 --> 04:08:29.294
PRESSURE VALVE THAT WOULD AVOID

04:08:29.361 --> 04:08:31.529
THOSE PRICE SPIKES. I THINK

04:08:31.596 --> 04:08:32.831
FIGURING OUT HOW YOU THREAD

04:08:32.897 --> 04:08:34.799
THAT NEEDLE IS IS A CHALLENGE.

04:08:34.866 --> 04:08:36.635
BUT I THINK CONCEPTUALLY THE

04:08:36.701 --> 04:08:38.903
GOAL WOULD BE THAT STEADY STATE

04:08:38.970 --> 04:08:41.906
IN STATE KABOB WOULD ACTUALLY

04:08:41.973 --> 04:08:43.108
BE THE LOWER PRICE ALTERNATIVE

04:08:43.174 --> 04:08:45.644
TO IMPORT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:47.612
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:08:47.679 --> 04:08:49.648
MACEDO. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

04:08:49.714 --> 04:08:51.950
I TOO AM A LIFELONG VALLEY

04:08:52.017 --> 04:08:54.052
RESIDENT. AND WHAT I CAN TELL

04:08:54.119 --> 04:08:57.389
YOU IS THAT WE ARE AT A

04:08:57.455 --> 04:08:58.657
GEOGRAPHICAL DISADVANTAGE WHERE

04:08:58.723 --> 04:09:02.394
WE LIVE, REGARDLESS OF IF OIL

04:09:02.460 --> 04:09:03.561
AND GAS ARE THERE. AND THE

04:09:03.628 --> 04:09:05.530
TRUTH IS, IS THAT THE STATE OF

04:09:05.597 --> 04:09:06.865
CALIFORNIA HAS DRAMATICALLY

04:09:06.931 --> 04:09:08.099
UNDERINVESTED IN THE CENTRAL

04:09:08.166 --> 04:09:09.901
VALLEY FOR YEARS, WHICH IS WHY

04:09:09.968 --> 04:09:12.170
I'M HERE. THE AVERAGE INCOME IN

04:09:12.237 --> 04:09:15.440
MY DISTRICT IS $31,000 A YEAR.

04:09:15.507 --> 04:09:17.742
WE STRUGGLE, BUT WHAT OIL AND

04:09:17.809 --> 04:09:20.211
GAS BRINGS TO KERN COUNTY IS

04:09:20.278 --> 04:09:22.914
JOBS AND COMMERCE THAT WILL

04:09:22.981 --> 04:09:24.683
DECIMATE KERN COUNTY IF THEY

04:09:24.749 --> 04:09:26.751
LEAVE THE THREE TOP TAXPAYERS

04:09:26.818 --> 04:09:28.820
FOR THINGS LIKE HOSPITALS AND

04:09:28.887 --> 04:09:29.821
PUBLIC SAFETY AND ROADS. AND

04:09:29.888 --> 04:09:33.425
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OIL

04:09:33.491 --> 04:09:34.759
AND GAS PRODUCERS. ONE THING

04:09:34.826 --> 04:09:36.961
THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON WITH OIL

04:09:37.028 --> 04:09:38.763
AND AG IS WE JUST CAN'T PICK UP

04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:40.932
AND LEAVE, AND ONCE WE LEAVE,

04:09:40.999 --> 04:09:44.469
WE CAN'T COME BACK. AND THAT'S

04:09:44.536 --> 04:09:45.804
GOING TO BE THE CONSUMERS

04:09:45.870 --> 04:09:46.738
ULTIMATELY HOLDING THE BAG FOR

04:09:46.805 --> 04:09:48.873
ALL OF THAT. SO I CAN

04:09:48.940 --> 04:09:50.542
UNDERSTAND THAT WE LIVE IN A

04:09:50.608 --> 04:09:51.776
PLACE THAT HAS SOME OF THE

04:09:51.843 --> 04:09:53.745
WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE WORLD,

04:09:53.812 --> 04:09:54.979
BUT IT'S NOT OIL AND GAS OR

04:09:55.046 --> 04:09:56.414
AGRICULTURE'S FAULT. IT'S

04:09:56.481 --> 04:09:57.649
UNFORTUNATELY THE GEOGRAPHIC

04:09:57.716 --> 04:09:58.883
LOCATION WE LIVE IN. AND

04:09:58.950 --> 04:10:00.618
SECONDLY, BECAUSE THE STATE OF

04:10:00.685 --> 04:10:03.288
CALIFORNIA WANTS TO FORGET THAT

04:10:03.355 --> 04:10:04.689
WE EXIST. SO I WOULD LOVE TO

04:10:04.756 --> 04:10:06.725
WORK WITH YOU TO REMIND THEM

04:10:06.791 --> 04:10:07.792
THAT WE'RE HERE. BUT I WOULD

04:10:07.859 --> 04:10:09.594
LIKE TO GO TO MR. LEARY FOR

04:10:09.661 --> 04:10:10.762
SOME QUESTIONS. YEAH. IF I

04:10:10.829 --> 04:10:12.797
COULD JUST ADDRESS THAT. I DO

04:10:12.864 --> 04:10:14.265
FEEL LIKE WE'RE FORGOTTEN. KERN

04:10:14.332 --> 04:10:15.667
COUNTY IS A SACRIFICE ZONE, AND

04:10:15.734 --> 04:10:17.902
I SEE THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE

04:10:17.969 --> 04:10:19.704
STATE ARE GETTING BETTER

04:10:19.771 --> 04:10:21.439
PROTECTIONS FOR OIL AND GAS

04:10:21.506 --> 04:10:21.906
WHEN THEY HAVE MINIMAL

04:10:21.973 --> 04:10:24.075
PRODUCTION, WHEN KERN COUNTY IS

04:10:24.142 --> 04:10:24.709
GETTING LESS OF THOSE

04:10:24.776 --> 04:10:25.777
PROTECTIONS, WHERE MOST OF THE

04:10:25.844 --> 04:10:27.112
PRODUCTION IS HAPPENING, WHERE

04:10:27.178 --> 04:10:28.680
MOST OF THE OIL IS HEAVY AND

04:10:28.747 --> 04:10:29.881
IT'S EXEMPTED FROM MEANINGFUL

04:10:29.948 --> 04:10:32.083
REGULATIONS, ALMOST ALL LEAK

04:10:32.150 --> 04:10:33.852
DETECTION AND REQUIREMENTS. SO

04:10:33.918 --> 04:10:35.954
AS A KERN COUNTY RESIDENT, I

04:10:36.020 --> 04:10:36.688
DON'T WANT OIL AND GAS GONE

04:10:36.755 --> 04:10:37.889
TOMORROW. I DON'T THINK THAT'S

04:10:37.956 --> 04:10:40.158
OUR INTENT. AND THERE ARE A LOT

04:10:40.225 --> 04:10:41.593
OF BROKEN AGREEMENTS WHERE

04:10:41.659 --> 04:10:42.761
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ARE LEFT

04:10:42.827 --> 04:10:45.263
HOLDING THE BAG FOR THINGS LIKE

04:10:45.330 --> 04:10:45.997
IDLE WELLS, FOR THINGS LIKE

04:10:46.064 --> 04:10:46.831
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

04:10:46.898 --> 04:10:48.800
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:10:48.867 --> 04:10:50.301
WE'RE NOT HANDED THESE BURDENS

04:10:50.368 --> 04:10:53.238
TO CONTINUE PROFIT FOR OIL AND

04:10:53.304 --> 04:10:55.039
GAS. WHEN THE EXTERNALIZED COST

04:10:55.106 --> 04:10:56.641
IS INCREASING, TAXPAYER MONEY

04:10:56.708 --> 04:10:58.076
BEING SPENT TO REMEDIATE BROKEN

04:10:58.143 --> 04:11:00.612
AGREEMENTS, AND ALSO FOR US TO

04:11:00.678 --> 04:11:04.616
LIKE WE SAW IN CHAIR RANDOLPH'S

04:11:04.682 --> 04:11:07.051
SLIDE, I THINK IT WAS SLIDE 14

04:11:07.118 --> 04:11:08.753
OR 13. THERE'S $200 BILLION OF

04:11:08.820 --> 04:11:09.854
HEALTH BENEFITS THAT WE WILL

04:11:09.921 --> 04:11:12.190
SEE. THAT'S NOT $200 BILLION

04:11:12.257 --> 04:11:13.725
THAT ARE GOING TO GO TO A

04:11:13.792 --> 04:11:14.826
SPECIFIC INDUSTRY OR TO

04:11:14.893 --> 04:11:16.661
STIMULATE, YOU KNOW, A CERTAIN

04:11:16.728 --> 04:11:17.228
BUSINESS THAT'S $200 BILLION

04:11:17.295 --> 04:11:18.863
THAT ARE GOING TO GO BACK INTO

04:11:18.930 --> 04:11:20.031
THE POCKETS OF CENTRAL VALLEY

04:11:20.098 --> 04:11:21.633
RESIDENTS THAT ARE BREATHING

04:11:21.699 --> 04:11:23.635
AIR FROM THE ONLY AIR BASIN IN

04:11:23.701 --> 04:11:25.003
THE NATION THAT HADN'T MET AIR

04:11:25.069 --> 04:11:27.205
STANDARDS THAT WERE SET BY BILL

04:11:27.272 --> 04:11:28.339
CLINTON IN 1997. THERE'S SOME

04:11:28.406 --> 04:11:28.973
INACCURACIES THERE. SO I'M

04:11:29.040 --> 04:11:31.042
GOING TO LET MR. LEARY ADDRESS

04:11:31.109 --> 04:11:33.211
THEM. I WANT TO BRING US BACK

04:11:33.278 --> 04:11:35.013
TO THE KERN COUNTY EIR AND WHAT

04:11:35.079 --> 04:11:36.815
THAT WAS DESIGNED TO DO. IT WAS

04:11:36.881 --> 04:11:38.616
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SEQUA FOR

04:11:38.683 --> 04:11:40.852
ON THE COUNTY WIDE BASIS FOR

04:11:40.919 --> 04:11:42.887
THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR. AND

04:11:42.954 --> 04:11:45.657
THERE ARE OVER 80 MITIGATION

04:11:45.723 --> 04:11:47.792
MEASURES IN THE CURRENT EIR

04:11:47.859 --> 04:11:49.594
MEASURE TO BE ABLE TO DRILL OIL

04:11:49.661 --> 04:11:51.796
AND GAS WELLS, THAT THE CHRONIC

04:11:51.863 --> 04:11:53.765
LITIGATION OVER THE TEN YEARS

04:11:53.832 --> 04:11:56.968
HAS STALLED. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

04:11:57.035 --> 04:11:58.736
WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE AS AN

04:11:58.803 --> 04:12:01.105
INDUSTRY OF GETTING THIS THING

04:12:01.172 --> 04:12:02.907
FINALIZED AND, YOU KNOW,

04:12:02.974 --> 04:12:04.909
GETTING THE MITIGATION MEASURES

04:12:04.976 --> 04:12:06.544
IMPLEMENTED. BUT THAT'S BEEN

04:12:06.611 --> 04:12:08.179
STALLED OUT. SO THERE ARE

04:12:08.246 --> 04:12:09.914
IMPROVEMENTS ON THE WAY. IF THE

04:12:09.981 --> 04:12:11.583
LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO CODIFY

04:12:11.649 --> 04:12:13.985
THE CURRENT EIR. I'M LOOKING

04:12:14.052 --> 04:12:15.653
FORWARD TO THAT. AND I KNOW

04:12:15.720 --> 04:12:18.790
THAT KERN IS VERY WELL GEARED

04:12:18.857 --> 04:12:20.558
TO ADDRESS THIS IN A WAY THAT

04:12:20.625 --> 04:12:21.793
IS HEALTHY FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

04:12:21.860 --> 04:12:23.828
SO MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU IS,

04:12:23.895 --> 04:12:25.296
WHAT IS OUR STATE'S REFINING

04:12:25.363 --> 04:12:27.599
CAPACITY TODAY? LIKE HOW WE

04:12:27.665 --> 04:12:29.000
HAVE A COUPLE REFINERIES,

04:12:29.067 --> 04:12:33.137
CORRECT? TWO. SO WE'RE WE HAVE

04:12:33.204 --> 04:12:34.639
NINE REFINERIES CURRENTLY, AND

04:12:34.706 --> 04:12:36.641
I THINK WE'RE ON KIND OF THE

04:12:36.708 --> 04:12:38.343
RAZOR'S EDGE OF MEETING,

04:12:38.409 --> 04:12:40.845
MEETING DEMAND WITH THE

04:12:40.912 --> 04:12:43.014
POTENTIAL CLOSURES WILL BE DOWN

04:12:43.081 --> 04:12:44.916
TO POTENTIALLY SEVEN. THERE'S

04:12:44.983 --> 04:12:46.518
ONE REFINERY IN THE CENTRAL

04:12:46.584 --> 04:12:47.652
VALLEY THAT PRODUCES VERY

04:12:47.719 --> 04:12:49.854
LITTLE CARB. SO REALLY SIX

04:12:49.921 --> 04:12:51.689
MAJOR REFINERIES IN CALIFORNIA,

04:12:51.756 --> 04:12:54.826
IF THE PLANS GO THROUGH IN 2026.

04:12:54.893 --> 04:12:56.895
SO HOW MUCH CAPACITY HAVE WE

04:12:56.961 --> 04:13:00.865
LOST IN RECENT YEARS? WELL,

04:13:00.932 --> 04:13:03.968
OVER MY TIME IN AT WHISPER,

04:13:04.035 --> 04:13:06.671
WE'VE BEEN WE'VE SEEN TWO

04:13:06.738 --> 04:13:09.140
CONVERSIONS OF OUR NORTHERN

04:13:09.207 --> 04:13:12.744
CALIFORNIA FACILITIES TO ALL

04:13:12.810 --> 04:13:13.878
RENEWABLE DIESEL, WHICH WE'RE

04:13:13.945 --> 04:13:16.714
REALLY PROUD OF. BUT THAT WAS

04:13:16.781 --> 04:13:18.683
LOST REFINING CAPACITY FROM

04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:20.685
THOSE. AND THEY WERE IN THE SIX

04:13:20.752 --> 04:13:22.086
CHART ON I THINK THEY WERE

04:13:22.153 --> 04:13:24.122
COLORED IN BLUE. SO WE'VE LOST

04:13:24.188 --> 04:13:25.223
CAPACITY THERE WITH THE

04:13:25.290 --> 04:13:26.057
ANNOUNCEMENTS. WE'RE GOING TO

04:13:26.124 --> 04:13:28.526
LOSE MORE CAPACITY. ABOUT 20%

04:13:28.593 --> 04:13:31.229
IS WHAT THE ESTIMATE IS. AND SO

04:13:31.296 --> 04:13:33.665
I THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY TO

04:13:33.731 --> 04:13:35.600
HOPEFULLY PROTECT THE EXISTING

04:13:35.667 --> 04:13:39.037
AND REMAINING ASSETS AND FUTURE

04:13:39.103 --> 04:13:40.638
CLOSURES FROM HAPPENING. SO IF

04:13:40.705 --> 04:13:42.674
WE STAY ON THAT TRAJECTORY,

04:13:42.740 --> 04:13:44.075
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR IMPORTS?

04:13:44.142 --> 04:13:45.677
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AS FAR AS

04:13:45.743 --> 04:13:47.812
AN INCREASE IN IMPORTS. YEAH, I

04:13:47.879 --> 04:13:49.013
THINK THAT'S I MEAN WE'VE SEEN

04:13:49.080 --> 04:13:50.715
A DRASTIC INCREASE IN IMPORTS

04:13:50.782 --> 04:13:53.284
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS

04:13:53.351 --> 04:13:56.220
WITH THE DECLINING REFINERY IN

04:13:56.287 --> 04:13:56.988
STATE REFINING CAPACITY. I

04:13:57.055 --> 04:13:59.223
THINK THAT'S A TREND THAT WILL

04:13:59.290 --> 04:14:00.992
LIKELY CONTINUE. I THINK ONE OF

04:14:01.059 --> 04:14:02.994
THE BIG THINGS AND I TALKED

04:14:03.061 --> 04:14:03.761
ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE HERE

04:14:03.828 --> 04:14:05.029
EARLIER THAT THIS COMMITTEE

04:14:05.096 --> 04:14:06.764
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS

04:14:06.831 --> 04:14:09.734
PORT CAPACITY. AS WE BECOME

04:14:09.801 --> 04:14:14.205
MORE RELIANT ON IMPORTS, ON

04:14:14.272 --> 04:14:15.873
BOTH CRUDE, IF WE DON'T, YOU

04:14:15.940 --> 04:14:17.575
KNOW, GET MORE CRUDE FROM

04:14:17.642 --> 04:14:18.743
IN-STATE PRODUCTION, IF WE

04:14:18.810 --> 04:14:20.044
BECOME MORE RELIANT ON FINISHED

04:14:20.111 --> 04:14:22.680
PRODUCT COMING IN VIA TANKER,

04:14:22.747 --> 04:14:24.882
YOU'RE GOING TO RUN INTO A PORT

04:14:24.949 --> 04:14:26.718
INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM AND NEED

04:14:26.784 --> 04:14:29.854
TO LOOK AT HOW TO BUILD OUT OR,

04:14:29.921 --> 04:14:31.189
YOU KNOW, ACCOMMODATE THOSE

04:14:31.255 --> 04:14:33.858
ADDITIONAL SHIPS COMING IN. SO

04:14:33.925 --> 04:14:35.660
ON MY TOURS IN KERN COUNTY, I

04:14:35.727 --> 04:14:36.861
HEARD OVER AND OVER AND OVER

04:14:36.928 --> 04:14:38.896
AGAIN, CERTAINTY, CERTAINTY,

04:14:38.963 --> 04:14:40.098
CERTAINTY. WE NEED CERTAINTY IN

04:14:40.164 --> 04:14:41.833
THE REGULATORY SPACE. SO WHAT

04:14:41.899 --> 04:14:44.602
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE OR MEAN FOR

04:14:44.669 --> 04:14:46.804
THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE? WHAT

04:14:46.871 --> 04:14:48.039
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CERTAINTY

04:14:48.106 --> 04:14:49.607
IN REGULATION? IS IT JUST IN

04:14:49.674 --> 04:14:50.808
PERMITTING OR IS IT ALSO IN

04:14:50.875 --> 04:14:54.646
REGULATION. SO ON. AND THAT'S A

04:14:54.712 --> 04:14:57.015
THAT'S A VERY BROAD QUESTION.

04:14:57.081 --> 04:14:57.882
AND THERE'S A LOT TO ANSWER

04:14:57.949 --> 04:14:59.784
HERE. I'LL CALL YOU LATER. YEAH.

04:14:59.851 --> 04:15:02.553
SO ON ON THE KIND OF UPSTREAM

04:15:02.620 --> 04:15:03.688
PRODUCTION SIDE, I THINK

04:15:03.755 --> 04:15:05.156
CERTAINTY IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

04:15:05.223 --> 04:15:06.557
I THINK THE KERN COUNTY EIR

04:15:06.624 --> 04:15:08.192
WOULD GIVE THE INDUSTRY A LOT

04:15:08.259 --> 04:15:10.361
OF CERTAINTY ON WHAT MITIGATION

04:15:10.428 --> 04:15:11.629
MEASURES HAVE TO BE MET TO BE

04:15:11.696 --> 04:15:14.966
ABLE TO DRILL A NEW WELL. SO WE

04:15:15.033 --> 04:15:16.534
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK

04:15:16.601 --> 04:15:18.503
THE UNCERTAINTY AT CAL JAM

04:15:18.569 --> 04:15:20.605
RIGHT NOW HAS LED TO LESS

04:15:20.672 --> 04:15:22.874
PERMITS BEING ISSUED, ALMOST TO

04:15:22.940 --> 04:15:25.343
NO PERMITS BEING ISSUED, AND

04:15:25.410 --> 04:15:27.278
THAT'S REALLY A TROUBLESOME

04:15:27.345 --> 04:15:29.013
BUSINESS MODEL WHEN YOU YOU

04:15:29.080 --> 04:15:31.749
DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF

04:15:31.816 --> 04:15:32.917
UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN I SUBMIT

04:15:32.984 --> 04:15:34.686
A PERMIT, WHAT'S THE TIMELINE

04:15:34.752 --> 04:15:36.721
GOING TO BE? HOW AM I GOING TO

04:15:36.788 --> 04:15:38.556
GET THERE TO MAKE MY BUSINESS

04:15:38.623 --> 04:15:41.025
MODEL WORK ON THE DOWNSTREAM

04:15:41.092 --> 04:15:42.593
SIDE? REGULATORY CERTAINTY IS

04:15:42.660 --> 04:15:44.662
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR REFINERIES,

04:15:44.729 --> 04:15:46.497
AND ONE OF THE MAJOR

04:15:46.564 --> 04:15:47.665
UNCERTAINTIES WE'RE FACING

04:15:47.732 --> 04:15:50.868
RIGHT NOW IS THE MARGIN CAP AND

04:15:50.935 --> 04:15:52.770
PENALTY THAT IS LOOMING AT THE

04:15:52.837 --> 04:15:54.806
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION.

04:15:54.872 --> 04:15:56.040
WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THEY'RE

04:15:56.107 --> 04:15:57.742
GOING TO PUT A PAUSE ON IT, BUT

04:15:57.809 --> 04:16:00.578
THAT HAS REALLY DETERRED

04:16:00.645 --> 04:16:02.480
INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN

04:16:02.547 --> 04:16:04.549
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OUR MEMBER

04:16:04.615 --> 04:16:05.650
COMPANIES CAN'T JUST GO TO THE

04:16:05.717 --> 04:16:07.785
BANKS AND SAY, DON'T WORRY,

04:16:07.852 --> 04:16:09.020
THEY'LL NEVER DO THE MARGIN CAP

04:16:09.087 --> 04:16:10.755
AND PENALTY. PEOPLE SEE THAT ON

04:16:10.822 --> 04:16:12.890
THE BOOKS AND IT'S A RISK. AND

04:16:12.957 --> 04:16:14.659
SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

04:16:14.726 --> 04:16:16.327
THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING A

04:16:16.394 --> 04:16:17.929
PAUSE ON THAT. THERE'S A WHOLE

04:16:17.995 --> 04:16:19.130
HOST OF OTHER THINGS I COULD

04:16:19.197 --> 04:16:21.065
GET INTO ON CERTAINTY, CAP AND

04:16:21.132 --> 04:16:22.033
TRADE BEING ONE OF THEM. THAT'S

04:16:22.100 --> 04:16:23.735
THAT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER

04:16:23.801 --> 04:16:24.969
THING THAT'S IN FRONT OF THE

04:16:25.036 --> 04:16:26.738
LEGISLATURE WHERE YOU GET TO

04:16:26.804 --> 04:16:28.372
DECIDE, ARE WE GOING TO PROVIDE

04:16:28.439 --> 04:16:29.874
A CERTAINTY OR IS IT GOING TO

04:16:29.941 --> 04:16:32.243
BE, YOU KNOW, MORE CHANGES THAT

04:16:32.310 --> 04:16:33.978
ARE GOING TO PROVIDE

04:16:34.045 --> 04:16:34.946
UNCERTAINTY TO THE INDUSTRY AND

04:16:35.012 --> 04:16:37.615
PEOPLE WILL MAKE DECISIONS. SO

04:16:37.682 --> 04:16:38.883
ONE THING THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN

04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:41.085
I WAS A NEW MEMBER, I TOOK SOME

04:16:41.152 --> 04:16:42.720
MEETINGS AND WHAT THEY SAID WAS,

04:16:42.787 --> 04:16:44.589
YOU KNOW, DON'T WORRY THE

04:16:44.655 --> 04:16:45.690
REFINERIES PRODUCERS, THEY'RE

04:16:45.757 --> 04:16:46.924
NOT GOING TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA.

04:16:46.991 --> 04:16:47.992
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO THREATEN

04:16:48.059 --> 04:16:49.761
THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE

04:16:49.827 --> 04:16:51.095
CALIFORNIA. AND IF WE HAVEN'T

04:16:51.162 --> 04:16:51.796
LEARNED IN THE LAST EIGHT

04:16:51.863 --> 04:16:53.264
MONTHS, CLEARLY THOSE PEOPLE

04:16:53.331 --> 04:16:54.966
ARE LEAVING. SO WHAT CAN WE

04:16:55.032 --> 04:16:57.802
LEARN FROM? I THINK THERE'S

04:16:57.869 --> 04:16:58.736
STILL A CHANCE TO KEEP SOME

04:16:58.803 --> 04:17:00.772
REFINERS HERE, SOME THAT ARE

04:17:00.838 --> 04:17:02.406
SAYING THERE'S NO CHANCE WE'RE

04:17:02.473 --> 04:17:03.775
DONE. WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER IN

04:17:03.841 --> 04:17:05.910
THE LEGISLATURE? WHAT CAN WE DO?

04:17:05.977 --> 04:17:07.645
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:17:07.712 --> 04:17:08.713
JOBS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:17:08.780 --> 04:17:09.714
SUPPLY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:17:09.781 --> 04:17:10.915
COMMERCE. I MEAN, RELIANCE ON

04:17:10.982 --> 04:17:12.550
FOREIGN OIL. THESE ARE ALL

04:17:12.617 --> 04:17:13.718
REALLY BIG TOPICS THAT WE CAN'T

04:17:13.785 --> 04:17:15.186
JUST KEEP TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE

04:17:15.253 --> 04:17:16.954
LIKE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT, TIME

04:17:17.021 --> 04:17:17.922
IS OF THE ESSENCE BECAUSE

04:17:17.989 --> 04:17:19.724
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING. SO HOW DO

04:17:19.791 --> 04:17:21.092
WE LEARN FROM THAT? HOW DO WE

04:17:21.159 --> 04:17:23.060
STOP THAT? HOW DO WE FIX IT? I

04:17:23.127 --> 04:17:25.096
THINK IT STARTS HONESTLY WITH

04:17:25.163 --> 04:17:26.063
THE RELATIONSHIPS. AND I THINK

04:17:26.130 --> 04:17:27.799
TO THE GOVERNOR AND, AND, YOU

04:17:27.865 --> 04:17:30.268
KNOW, VICE CHAIR RANDOLPH,

04:17:30.334 --> 04:17:33.771
DIRECTOR LUCCHESE, WE'VE WE'VE

04:17:33.838 --> 04:17:35.973
CHANGED THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN OUR

04:17:36.040 --> 04:17:37.809
INDUSTRY AND WITH THEM AS THE

04:17:37.875 --> 04:17:39.877
REGULATORS AND THE

04:17:39.944 --> 04:17:41.646
ADMINISTRATION. CHAIR. BRIAN.

04:17:41.712 --> 04:17:43.047
CHAIR PETRIE-NORRIS. CHAIR.

04:17:43.114 --> 04:17:45.583
WILSON. I MEAN, I THINK WE HAVE

04:17:45.650 --> 04:17:46.751
A REALLY GOOD WORKING

04:17:46.818 --> 04:17:48.286
RELATIONSHIP TO UNDERSTAND THE

04:17:48.352 --> 04:17:49.587
CHALLENGES. AND, YOU KNOW, TO

04:17:49.654 --> 04:17:51.856
TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S CREDIT,

04:17:51.923 --> 04:17:52.990
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SIT AT THE

04:17:53.057 --> 04:17:55.326
TABLE, HAVE THESE REALLY

04:17:55.393 --> 04:17:56.460
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

04:17:56.527 --> 04:17:57.762
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NEEDED. AND

04:17:57.829 --> 04:17:59.831
I THINK THAT'S A CULTURE SHIFT

04:17:59.897 --> 04:18:01.933
THAT HOPEFULLY, IF WE GET THIS

04:18:01.999 --> 04:18:03.634
STABILIZATION RIGHT, CAN BE A

04:18:03.701 --> 04:18:05.069
DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

04:18:05.136 --> 04:18:07.138
THE STATE AND THE INDUSTRY

04:18:07.205 --> 04:18:08.673
GOING FORWARD THAT WE

04:18:08.739 --> 04:18:10.508
UNDERSTAND. LOOK, WE'RE WE'RE

04:18:10.575 --> 04:18:12.076
HERE OPERATING. OUR MEMBERS

04:18:12.143 --> 04:18:12.910
WANT TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE

04:18:12.977 --> 04:18:15.079
HERE, AND WE NEED TO HAVE THAT

04:18:15.146 --> 04:18:17.215
PARTNERSHIP GOING FORWARD. AND

04:18:17.281 --> 04:18:17.849
SO I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

04:18:17.915 --> 04:18:18.883
START. I THINK THESE

04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:20.218
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN

04:18:20.284 --> 04:18:21.586
HAVING WITH THE VICE CHAIR AND

04:18:21.652 --> 04:18:24.388
THE OTHER AGENCIES HAVE BEEN

04:18:24.455 --> 04:18:26.724
REALLY PRODUCTIVE, AND WE HOPE

04:18:26.791 --> 04:18:28.693
TO SEE ACTION OUT OF IT TO

04:18:28.759 --> 04:18:30.595
PREVENT THE FUTURE CLOSURES OF

04:18:30.661 --> 04:18:32.797
OTHER FACILITIES. AND THEN MY

04:18:32.864 --> 04:18:33.898
FINAL QUESTION, MADAM CHAIR, IS

04:18:33.965 --> 04:18:36.033
JUST, YOU KNOW, ONE THING THAT

04:18:36.100 --> 04:18:36.868
WAS ENLIGHTENING FOR ME WAS I

04:18:36.934 --> 04:18:38.803
COME FROM THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN.

04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:40.571
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE

04:18:40.638 --> 04:18:41.839
TIME WE PUT THAT CROP IN THE

04:18:41.906 --> 04:18:44.008
GROUND TO GET IT TO THE TABLE,

04:18:44.075 --> 04:18:45.009
THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS THAT

04:18:45.076 --> 04:18:47.211
HAS TO HAPPEN. AND FOR ME, THE

04:18:47.278 --> 04:18:48.579
REFINERY PART OF THIS WAS WHAT

04:18:48.646 --> 04:18:49.714
WAS INTERESTING, THAT WE CAN

04:18:49.780 --> 04:18:50.781
HAVE SUPPLY, BUT IF WE

04:18:50.848 --> 04:18:52.049
ULTIMATELY DON'T HAVE THE

04:18:52.116 --> 04:18:53.184
REFINERIES, THAT'S A REALLY BIG

04:18:53.251 --> 04:18:54.919
PROBLEM. SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR

04:18:54.986 --> 04:18:56.020
THOSE THAT MAYBE DON'T

04:18:56.087 --> 04:18:57.822
UNDERSTAND THAT WHOLE SUPPLY

04:18:57.889 --> 04:18:59.724
CHAIN, WHAT ROLES REFINERIES

04:18:59.790 --> 04:19:00.625
PLAY IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE

04:19:00.691 --> 04:19:04.095
THAT RELIABLE FUEL SUPPLY? YES.

04:19:04.161 --> 04:19:06.898
SO CRUDE OIL. YEAH. THERE'S NO

04:19:06.964 --> 04:19:08.933
NO PLACE TO PUT THE CRUDE OIL.

04:19:09.000 --> 04:19:10.534
THERE'S NO NEED TO NECESSARILY

04:19:10.601 --> 04:19:13.104
PRODUCE IT. SO THE REFINERIES

04:19:13.170 --> 04:19:14.572
ARE THE THE CONSUMER OF THAT

04:19:14.639 --> 04:19:15.673
CRUDE OIL THAT TURN IT INTO

04:19:15.740 --> 04:19:17.675
GASOLINE, DIESEL AND JET FUEL.

04:19:17.742 --> 04:19:19.010
AND SO IT'S CRITICALLY

04:19:19.076 --> 04:19:22.046
IMPORTANT THAT AS THE AS WE

04:19:22.113 --> 04:19:22.780
THINK ABOUT THE SYSTEM AND HOW

04:19:22.847 --> 04:19:24.782
IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER, THAT YOU

04:19:24.849 --> 04:19:27.184
HAVE TO HAVE THAT CRUDE OIL TO

04:19:27.251 --> 04:19:30.087
FEED THE REFINERY TO, TO

04:19:30.154 --> 04:19:30.655
ULTIMATELY GET TO YOUR

04:19:30.721 --> 04:19:31.956
CONSTITUENTS THE GASOLINE THEY

04:19:32.023 --> 04:19:33.658
NEED. AND I DID WANT TO TOUCH

04:19:33.724 --> 04:19:35.626
ON A, ON A POINT THAT YOU

04:19:35.693 --> 04:19:37.094
BROUGHT UP ABOUT IN-STATE

04:19:37.161 --> 04:19:37.929
PRODUCTION, BECAUSE THERE IS A

04:19:37.995 --> 04:19:38.663
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

04:19:38.729 --> 04:19:40.665
LOGISTICS COSTS, BETWEEN

04:19:40.731 --> 04:19:42.667
FOREIGN CRUDE AND A BARREL

04:19:42.733 --> 04:19:44.769
PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA. IF

04:19:44.835 --> 04:19:45.970
YOU'RE PRODUCING IN CALIFORNIA

04:19:46.037 --> 04:19:47.838
AND TRANSPORTING VIA PIPELINE,

04:19:47.905 --> 04:19:50.308
IT'S ABOUT A DOLLAR A BARREL

04:19:50.374 --> 04:19:51.676
FOR LOGISTIC COSTS. IF YOU'RE

04:19:51.742 --> 04:19:54.078
LOOKING AT FOREIGN CRUDE, IT'S

04:19:54.145 --> 04:19:56.681
ABOUT 4 TO $5, UP TO $6 IN

04:19:56.747 --> 04:19:58.950
LOGISTICS COSTS. SO THERE IS A

04:19:59.016 --> 04:20:00.985
DIFFERENCE. AND THEN TO THE

04:20:01.052 --> 04:20:02.320
LOCAL PRODUCTION POINT, A LOT

04:20:02.386 --> 04:20:03.955
OF CALIFORNIA REFINERIES WERE

04:20:04.021 --> 04:20:05.756
SET UP TO TAKE THAT HEAVY

04:20:05.823 --> 04:20:07.959
CALIFORNIA CRUDE. ALL RIGHT.

04:20:08.025 --> 04:20:10.695
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND CHAIR

04:20:10.761 --> 04:20:12.763
BRIAN, I JUST HAVE ONE QUICK

04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:15.299
QUESTION TO FOLKS IN KERN WHO

04:20:15.366 --> 04:20:17.168
WOULD SAY THAT CODIFYING THE

04:20:17.234 --> 04:20:19.603
EIR SAVES THE INDUSTRY MONEY

04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:21.172
AND LITIGATION, POTENTIALLY AT

04:20:21.238 --> 04:20:25.042
THE EXPENSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL

04:20:25.109 --> 04:20:25.977
REVIEW OR THE COMMUNITY'S

04:20:26.043 --> 04:20:27.478
ABILITY TO CHALLENGE THAT

04:20:27.545 --> 04:20:30.081
REVIEW IN COURT, SO SAVES

04:20:30.147 --> 04:20:31.215
LITIGATION EXPENSES AND THEN

04:20:31.282 --> 04:20:33.684
ALSO OPENS UP NEW SUPPLY

04:20:33.751 --> 04:20:35.853
PIPELINES FOR THE INDUSTRY TO

04:20:35.920 --> 04:20:36.754
EXTRACT AND MAKE MORE MONEY

04:20:36.821 --> 04:20:39.190
THAT THE COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE

04:20:39.256 --> 04:20:41.125
SOME SORT OF BENEFIT FOR THE

04:20:41.192 --> 04:20:42.760
STATE. CODIFYING THE. SIR, WHAT

04:20:42.827 --> 04:20:45.663
WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT? HAPPY TO

04:20:45.730 --> 04:20:47.098
SHARE THE MITIGATION MEASURES

04:20:47.164 --> 04:20:48.866
THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE

04:20:48.933 --> 04:20:50.868
CURRENT YEAR, BECAUSE THERE ARE

04:20:50.935 --> 04:20:53.404
A WHOLE HOST OF MEASURES OF

04:20:53.471 --> 04:20:54.605
COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT ARE

04:20:54.672 --> 04:20:56.741
EMBEDDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

04:20:56.807 --> 04:20:57.842
SO I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH

04:20:57.908 --> 04:20:59.710
THOSE THOSE WITH YOU AFTER. I

04:20:59.777 --> 04:21:01.812
JUST DON'T HAVE IT OFF MY HAND.

04:21:01.879 --> 04:21:04.448
I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE

04:21:04.515 --> 04:21:05.950
CURRENT EIR, THE JUDGE DECIDED

04:21:06.017 --> 04:21:08.753
THAT THE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

04:21:08.819 --> 04:21:10.821
WAS DEEMED INSUFFICIENT AND

04:21:10.888 --> 04:21:13.090
KERN COUNTY DID NOT REDO A

04:21:13.157 --> 04:21:15.760
PROPER HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT.

04:21:15.826 --> 04:21:18.796
WHAT THEY DID IS RELY ON SB

04:21:18.863 --> 04:21:20.865
1137 AND THE IMPACT OF IT, OUR

04:21:20.931 --> 04:21:21.732
PLANNING COMMISSIONER, LAURA

04:21:21.799 --> 04:21:23.034
OVIATT, SAID THAT THEY RESPECT

04:21:23.100 --> 04:21:25.169
IT AS THE LAW OF THE LAND, BUT

04:21:25.236 --> 04:21:26.737
THEY BY NO MEANS AGREE WITH IT.

04:21:26.804 --> 04:21:28.839
AND TOWARDS THE END OF THE

04:21:28.906 --> 04:21:29.840
HEARING, WHERE THEY APPROVED

04:21:29.907 --> 04:21:31.776
THAT PERMIT, OUR SUPERVISOR,

04:21:31.842 --> 04:21:33.744
DAVID COUCH, ASKED, WELL, IF SB

04:21:33.811 --> 04:21:35.112
1137 IS CHALLENGED, CAN WE

04:21:35.179 --> 04:21:36.180
BEGIN TO PERMIT WELLS WITHIN

04:21:36.247 --> 04:21:38.215
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY SETBACK

04:21:38.282 --> 04:21:39.884
ZONE? SO WE KNOW THAT KERN

04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:41.118
COUNTY SUPERVISORS ARE ALREADY

04:21:41.185 --> 04:21:43.087
LOOKING TO UNDO THE PROTECTIONS

04:21:43.154 --> 04:21:44.722
THAT EXIST INSIDE OF THE EIR

04:21:44.789 --> 04:21:46.724
THAT ARE RELIANT ON SB 1137,

04:21:46.791 --> 04:21:48.526
BECAUSE THERE IS NO HEALTH

04:21:48.592 --> 04:21:50.761
IMPACT STUDY THAT EXISTS, OR

04:21:50.828 --> 04:21:52.396
THAT IS SUFFICIENT AS DECIDED

04:21:52.463 --> 04:21:53.697
BY THE COURTS. SO IF WE FEEL

04:21:53.764 --> 04:21:56.801
THAT THE EIR IS SUFFICIENT,

04:21:56.867 --> 04:21:58.269
THEN WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT

04:21:58.335 --> 04:21:59.637
THE 3200 FOOT SETBACK

04:21:59.703 --> 04:22:01.806
PROTECTIONS AND SAFETY ZONE IS

04:22:01.872 --> 04:22:04.875
SOMETHING THAT IS SET IN STONE

04:22:04.942 --> 04:22:06.677
AND CAN PROTECT KERN COUNTY,

04:22:06.744 --> 04:22:08.779
AND WON'T FALL VICTIM TO

04:22:08.846 --> 04:22:09.880
LITIGATION OR TO LEGAL

04:22:09.947 --> 04:22:12.016
CHALLENGES BECAUSE THERE IS NO

04:22:12.083 --> 04:22:13.517
HEALTH ASSESSMENT OR HEALTH

04:22:13.584 --> 04:22:15.386
IMPACT ASSESSMENT THAT'S DONE

04:22:15.453 --> 04:22:17.755
THAT WAS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY

04:22:17.822 --> 04:22:20.124
THE COURTS. SO WE NEED TO MAKE

04:22:20.191 --> 04:22:20.825
SURE THAT PROPER PROTECTIONS

04:22:20.891 --> 04:22:21.926
EXIST AND NOT SOMETHING THAT

04:22:21.992 --> 04:22:23.694
CAN BE CHALLENGED IN COURT AND

04:22:23.761 --> 04:22:25.029
UNDONE. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND

04:22:25.096 --> 04:22:27.031
PEOPLE THAT TODAY A JUDGE

04:22:27.098 --> 04:22:30.601
DISMISSED THE STATE'S THE

04:22:30.668 --> 04:22:32.069
STATE'S REQUEST TO TO DISMISS

04:22:32.136 --> 04:22:33.737
THE TRIAL. SO RIGHT NOW THERE

04:22:33.804 --> 04:22:35.840
IS ACTIVE THREAT AGAINST THE

04:22:35.906 --> 04:22:37.875
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE INSIDE OF

04:22:37.942 --> 04:22:39.710
THE CURRENT EIR, AND IT'S THE

04:22:39.777 --> 04:22:40.945
ONLY THING THAT IT'S RELIANT ON

04:22:41.011 --> 04:22:42.646
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THE

04:22:42.713 --> 04:22:44.115
PROPER HEALTH ASSESSMENT. WHAT

04:22:44.181 --> 04:22:45.549
WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT

04:22:45.616 --> 04:22:46.584
BOLSTERING AND CODIFYING

04:22:46.650 --> 04:22:48.986
EXISTING LAW TO ENSURE THAT

04:22:49.053 --> 04:22:50.521
THIS MEASURE DOESN'T UNDERMINE

04:22:50.588 --> 04:22:51.689
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

04:22:51.755 --> 04:22:52.823
PROTECTION ZONES THAT WERE

04:22:52.890 --> 04:22:54.825
CREATED, SINCE THAT IS THE

04:22:54.892 --> 04:22:56.060
CURRENT LAW BY IF THE

04:22:56.127 --> 04:22:58.362
LEGISLATURE WERE TO GO AHEAD

04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:59.930
AND BOLSTER THE CURRENT EIR,

04:22:59.997 --> 04:23:02.366
HOPING THAT THOSE HEALTH AND

04:23:02.433 --> 04:23:03.134
SAFETY PROTECTIONS REMAINED IN

04:23:03.200 --> 04:23:05.236
PLACE AND DID EVERYTHING WE

04:23:05.302 --> 04:23:07.238
COULD TO DO THAT, WOULD THAT BE

04:23:07.304 --> 04:23:07.805
SOMETHING THE INDUSTRY ALSO

04:23:07.872 --> 04:23:09.406
RECOGNIZES IS PART OF THIS

04:23:09.473 --> 04:23:12.810
PROCESS? I MEAN, THE 3200 FOOT

04:23:12.877 --> 04:23:14.578
SETBACK IS THE LAW OF THE LAND.

04:23:14.645 --> 04:23:17.381
A CITY OR COUNTY ORDINANCE

04:23:17.448 --> 04:23:19.884
CAN'T OVERRIDE THE LAW OF THE

04:23:19.950 --> 04:23:21.752
LAND. SO I BELIEVE IT'S ALREADY

04:23:21.819 --> 04:23:23.721
BUILT IN. BUT HAPPY TO GO BACK

04:23:23.787 --> 04:23:25.823
TO MY FOLKS AND AND DOUBLE

04:23:25.890 --> 04:23:27.791
CHECK. BUT IT IS THE LAW.

04:23:27.858 --> 04:23:29.660
CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN'T TRUMP

04:23:29.727 --> 04:23:32.596
WHAT THE STATE HAS IMPOSED.

04:23:32.663 --> 04:23:35.900
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. WITH THAT,

04:23:35.966 --> 04:23:37.735

MONAGAN, ON BEHALF OF THE STATE

04:25:03.520 --> 04:25:06.557
BUILDING TRADES. WE SUPPORT THE

04:25:06.624 --> 04:25:09.560
EIR. THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE

04:25:09.627 --> 04:25:12.763
RAISED BY CHAIR BRYANT ARE

04:25:12.830 --> 04:25:14.098

INVESTIGATE MORE AND TO SEE HOW

04:25:20.738 --> 04:25:22.806
THAT WORKS OUT. WE WOULD LIKE

04:25:22.873 --> 04:25:25.943

04:25:26.010 --> 04:25:27.444
STIMULATION. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

ERWIN BROUGHT IT UP, AND I

04:25:29.079 --> 04:25:30.648
DON'T THINK THERE WAS A

04:25:30.714 --> 04:25:31.582
QUANTIFIABLE ANSWER YET. SO I

04:25:31.649 --> 04:25:35.286
THINK THAT DESERVES SOME MORE

04:25:35.352 --> 04:25:37.321
INTROSPECTION. ALSO, WE'D ALSO

04:25:37.388 --> 04:25:38.922

OFFSHORE PRODUCTION. MR. HART

04:25:41.358 --> 04:25:42.726
HATES ME TO SAY THAT, BUT

04:25:42.793 --> 04:25:45.796
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. I'D LIKE

04:25:45.863 --> 04:25:48.699
TO ENDORSE REAUTHORIZING THE

04:25:48.766 --> 04:25:50.534

04:25:50.601 --> 04:25:52.936
PART OF THIS INDUSTRY, AND IT

04:25:53.003 --> 04:25:54.905
NEEDS TO BE DONE QUICKLY AND

04:25:54.972 --> 04:25:55.906
ALSO REINFORCE THE FACT THAT

04:25:55.973 --> 04:25:58.942
OUR WORKFORCE IS HIGHLY SKILLED

04:25:59.009 --> 04:26:01.045

REFINERY CLOSES, THAT JUST DOES

04:26:02.946 --> 04:26:04.048
NOT MORE THAN IT'S MORE THAN

04:26:04.114 --> 04:26:04.782
JUST THE WORKERS, IT'S THE

04:26:04.848 --> 04:26:07.117

04:26:07.184 --> 04:26:07.951

FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. SOME

04:26:48.992 --> 04:26:51.028
LEGISLATORS HAVE THE IMPRESSION

04:26:51.095 --> 04:26:52.596
THAT THE OFFSHORE PROVISIONS IN

SITE OF THE INFAMOUS 1969 OIL

04:27:54.057 --> 04:27:54.792
SPILL AND THE MORE RECENT

04:27:54.858 --> 04:27:58.195
MASSIVE 2015 PIPELINE OIL SPILL

04:27:58.262 --> 04:28:00.931

THAT CAME TO LIGHT AFTER THE

04:28:18.949 --> 04:28:21.051
2015 SPILL. WHILE THE PN

04:28:21.118 --> 04:28:22.719
INCLUDES SOME OF THE PROVISIONS

04:28:22.786 --> 04:28:24.621
OF THOSE TWO BILLS, IT OMITS

04:28:24.688 --> 04:28:27.391
AND WEAKENS SOME IMPORTANT

FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. WE

URGE YOU TO INCLUDE THESE

04:28:44.641 --> 04:28:46.577
PROVISIONS, WHICH WERE APPROVED

04:28:46.643 --> 04:28:47.644
BY THE LEGISLATURE AND ARE

04:28:47.711 --> 04:28:52.716
PENDING. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

04:28:52.783 --> 04:28:55.519
HI, MY NAME IS SARAH THEISS. I

04:28:55.586 --> 04:28:56.720
AM A RETIRED ATTORNEY FOR THE

04:28:56.787 --> 04:28:57.855
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND A

04:28:57.921 --> 04:28:59.022
MEMBER OF FOSSIL FREE

04:28:59.089 --> 04:29:01.024
CALIFORNIA. I HAVE FOUR QUICK

04:29:01.091 --> 04:29:02.860
POINTS. FIRST, HOW MUCH OIL IS

04:29:02.926 --> 04:29:04.995
BEING EXPORTED AND COULD THIS

04:29:05.062 --> 04:29:06.864
HELP? SECOND, OIL PRICES ARE

04:29:06.930 --> 04:29:09.032
SET INTERNATIONALLY AND CHEVRON

04:29:09.099 --> 04:29:11.735
ETC. OPERATE IN A GLOBAL MARKET.

04:29:11.802 --> 04:29:13.804
SO I QUESTION HOW MUCH THIS IS

04:29:13.871 --> 04:29:14.838
GOING TO REALLY CHANGE THE

04:29:14.905 --> 04:29:16.907
PRICE OF GAS. THIRD, THE

04:29:16.974 --> 04:29:18.575
CREDIBILITY OF THIS INDUSTRY IS

04:29:18.642 --> 04:29:20.777
ZILCH. THEY'VE LIED TO US FOR

04:29:20.844 --> 04:29:22.112
DECADES, HAVE GONE BACK ON ALL

04:29:22.179 --> 04:29:23.647
THEIR PROMISES, SUPPOSED GREEN

04:29:23.714 --> 04:29:24.982
PROMISES AND TRANSITION PLANS.

04:29:25.048 --> 04:29:26.717
AND I FEEL LIKE THE LEGISLATURE

04:29:26.783 --> 04:29:28.719
IS LEGISLATURES BEING

04:29:28.785 --> 04:29:29.887
HOODWINKED. AND FOURTH, THESE

04:29:29.953 --> 04:29:31.555
TRENDS HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS FOR

04:29:31.622 --> 04:29:33.790
YEARS. WHY ARE THE GOVERNOR AND

04:29:33.857 --> 04:29:34.925
LEGISLATURE FORCING THIS ISSUE

04:29:34.992 --> 04:29:36.627
IN JUST THREE WEEKS, WITHOUT

04:29:36.693 --> 04:29:37.895
TIME FOR THE VOTERS TO LEARN

04:29:37.961 --> 04:29:40.097
AND RESPOND TO THIS? IT MAKES

04:29:40.163 --> 04:29:41.865
ME VERY SUSPICIOUS AND UNHAPPY.

04:29:41.932 --> 04:29:45.969
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ASHA

04:29:46.036 --> 04:29:46.770
SHARMA, ON BEHALF OF LEADERSHIP

04:29:46.837 --> 04:29:48.305
COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND

04:29:48.372 --> 04:29:49.940
ACCOUNTABILITY. IN NO UNIVERSE

04:29:50.007 --> 04:29:51.742
CAN OIL AND GAS DRILLING BE

04:29:51.808 --> 04:29:53.377
CONSIDERED A LOW ENVIRONMENTAL

04:29:53.443 --> 04:29:55.078
IMPACT ACTIVITY THAT SHOULD BE

04:29:55.145 --> 04:29:57.214
EXEMPTED FROM SEQUA TO ALLOW

04:29:57.281 --> 04:29:59.216
INCREASED OIL EXTRACTION

04:29:59.283 --> 04:30:00.784
WITHOUT MITIGATION OF ITS

04:30:00.851 --> 04:30:02.853
IMPACTS IS A TOTAL AFFRONT TO

04:30:02.920 --> 04:30:03.587
OUR STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL AND

04:30:03.654 --> 04:30:05.722
EQUITY VALUES. IT WOULD BE A

04:30:05.789 --> 04:30:07.024
TOTAL BETRAYAL OF THE

04:30:07.090 --> 04:30:08.592
COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK WITH

04:30:08.659 --> 04:30:09.826
IN KERN COUNTY, WHOSE HEALTH

04:30:09.893 --> 04:30:12.396
AND WELL-BEING WOULD BE

04:30:12.462 --> 04:30:12.996
SACRIFICED TO APPEASE THE OIL

04:30:13.063 --> 04:30:15.265
INDUSTRY. THE COMMUNITIES WE

04:30:15.332 --> 04:30:15.699
PARTNER WITH DESERVE

04:30:15.766 --> 04:30:17.000
AFFORDABILITY JUST AS MUCH AS

04:30:17.067 --> 04:30:18.268
THEY DESERVE SAFE DRINKING

04:30:18.335 --> 04:30:20.003
WATER, CLEAN AIR AND A LIVABLE

04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:21.471
CLIMATE. WE URGE THE

04:30:21.538 --> 04:30:22.839
LEGISLATURE TO INSTEAD COMMIT

04:30:22.906 --> 04:30:24.908
TO A MANAGED PHASEDOWN OF OIL

04:30:24.975 --> 04:30:26.910
AND GAS THAT BALANCES URGENT

04:30:26.977 --> 04:30:27.611
CLIMATE ACTION WITH

04:30:27.678 --> 04:30:28.979
AFFORDABILITY PROTECTIONS FOR

04:30:29.046 --> 04:30:32.015
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS, AND TO

04:30:32.082 --> 04:30:33.584
STAND WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS

04:30:33.650 --> 04:30:34.685
AND CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE CLEAR

04:30:34.751 --> 04:30:36.653
THAT WE NEED URGENT CLIMATE

04:30:36.720 --> 04:30:38.722
ACTION NOW AND TO END HANDOUTS

04:30:38.789 --> 04:30:41.258
TO POLLUTING INDUSTRIES. THANK

04:30:41.325 --> 04:30:44.561
YOU, THANK YOU. I'M KATHY

04:30:44.628 --> 04:30:46.697
KERRIDGE OF BENICIA. I'M ALSO

04:30:46.763 --> 04:30:48.432
WITH 350 BAY AREA ACTION.

04:30:48.498 --> 04:30:49.800
TRANSITIONS ARE ALWAYS HARD,

04:30:49.866 --> 04:30:51.935
AND THE STATE'S MAIN OBLIGATION

04:30:52.002 --> 04:30:53.070
AT THIS POINT SHOULD BE TO

04:30:53.136 --> 04:30:54.638
COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:30:54.705 --> 04:30:56.840
MOST IMPACTED. AND THAT

04:30:56.907 --> 04:30:58.609
INCLUDES BENICIA RIGHT NOW.

04:30:58.675 --> 04:31:00.744
IT'LL BE OTHERS IN THE FUTURE,

04:31:00.811 --> 04:31:02.913
LOW INCOME DRIVERS AND THE

04:31:02.980 --> 04:31:04.781
EMPLOYEES. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

04:31:04.848 --> 04:31:07.150
WE CONTINUE TO DRILL WITHOUT

04:31:07.217 --> 04:31:07.751
OFFERING MORE PROTECTIONS FOR

04:31:07.818 --> 04:31:10.187
THE PEOPLES IN THE PEOPLE IN

04:31:10.253 --> 04:31:11.655
THOSE COMMUNITIES, AND WE ALSO

04:31:11.722 --> 04:31:14.191
HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT THE $0.60

04:31:14.257 --> 04:31:15.559
PER GALLON OF GAS THAT NOBODY

04:31:15.626 --> 04:31:16.793
QUITE KNOWS WHERE WHY WE'RE

04:31:16.860 --> 04:31:18.795
BEING CHARGED. THAT MIGHT BE

04:31:18.862 --> 04:31:20.497
BECAUSE OF LACK OF COMPETITION,

04:31:20.564 --> 04:31:21.865
BUT WE HAVE TO START ATTACKING

04:31:21.932 --> 04:31:24.334
THE DEMAND SIDE. AND THAT MEANS

04:31:24.401 --> 04:31:25.235
GETTING LOW INCOME PEOPLE INTO

04:31:25.302 --> 04:31:27.738
EVS AND BEEFING UP PUBLIC

04:31:27.804 --> 04:31:29.673
TRANSPORTATION. AB 674 RIGHT

04:31:29.740 --> 04:31:32.009
NOW IS IN THE ASSEMBLY. THAT

04:31:32.075 --> 04:31:33.644
WOULD GIVE CREDITS TO LOW

04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:36.713
INCOME PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF GAS

04:31:36.780 --> 04:31:39.249
GUZZLERS. IT'S IT'S JUST

04:31:39.316 --> 04:31:40.851
SITTING HERE. WE NEED TO NOT

04:31:40.917 --> 04:31:42.653
VETO AND BLOCK THOSE KINDS OF

04:31:42.719 --> 04:31:44.921
BILLS. THERE'S A LOT YOU CAN DO,

04:31:44.988 --> 04:31:46.823
BUT YOU HAVEN'T. ONE IMMEDIATE

04:31:46.890 --> 04:31:49.026
RESPONSE WAY TO LOWER DEMAND IS

04:31:49.092 --> 04:31:52.462
TO LOWER THE SPEED LIMIT. THANK

04:31:52.529 --> 04:31:58.802
YOU. GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS

04:31:58.869 --> 04:32:01.371
MARILYN BARDET. I'M A RESIDENT

04:32:01.438 --> 04:32:03.273
SINCE 1986, IN BENICIA, AND

04:32:03.340 --> 04:32:05.042
I'VE BEEN A 25 YEAR WATCHDOG ON

04:32:05.108 --> 04:32:06.910
THE REFINERY SINCE VALERO

04:32:06.977 --> 04:32:09.980
BOUGHT THE REFINERY FROM EXXON.

04:32:10.047 --> 04:32:11.948
FOR VENETIANS, THE FUTURE IS

04:32:12.015 --> 04:32:14.017
NOW. MANY VENETIANS SUPPORT

04:32:14.084 --> 04:32:16.119
VALERO'S CHOICE TO CEASE

04:32:16.186 --> 04:32:18.522
OPERATIONS. WE KNOW WHY VALERO

04:32:18.588 --> 04:32:21.758
EARNED AN $82 MILLION FINE FROM

04:32:21.825 --> 04:32:23.694
THE SAN FRANCISCO AIR DISTRICT.

04:32:23.760 --> 04:32:26.063
VALERO REJECTED A CITIZEN

04:32:26.129 --> 04:32:27.264
DRIVEN INDUSTRIAL SAFETY

04:32:27.330 --> 04:32:30.133
ORDINANCE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY

04:32:30.200 --> 04:32:30.934
THE CITY. THEY REJECTED THE

04:32:31.001 --> 04:32:32.569
PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT

04:32:32.636 --> 04:32:35.906
PROTOCOLS THAT WERE TO BE PART

04:32:35.972 --> 04:32:38.008
OF THAT ISO, BUT DROPPED.

04:32:38.075 --> 04:32:39.242
VALERO THREATENED TO SUE THE

04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:43.046
CITY. THERE IS NO REASON THAT

04:32:43.113 --> 04:32:45.582
DEMAND CAN'T BE MET BY

04:32:45.649 --> 04:32:47.918
CONSERVATION. DRIVE 55, AS

04:32:47.984 --> 04:32:52.756
PRESIDENT CARTER SAID. A JUST

04:32:52.823 --> 04:32:56.727
TRANSITION MUST MEAN MAINTAIN

04:32:56.793 --> 04:32:58.528
ALL STATE, REGIONAL AND LOCAL

04:32:58.595 --> 04:33:00.630
PROTECTIONS IN INCLUDING

04:33:00.697 --> 04:33:01.832
REGULATION SUPPORTING

04:33:01.898 --> 04:33:04.701
COMMUNITIES LIKE SEQUA FOR

04:33:04.768 --> 04:33:05.736
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THE

04:33:05.802 --> 04:33:07.304
CLIMATE. THANK YOU MA'AM, AND I

04:33:07.370 --> 04:33:08.772
DO. I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE IF I

04:33:08.839 --> 04:33:11.074
HAVE TO CUT ANYONE OFF. THERE'S

04:33:11.141 --> 04:33:12.008
A LONG LINE OF PEOPLE WAITING

04:33:12.075 --> 04:33:13.710
TO PRESENT, SO IF YOU DON'T GET

04:33:13.777 --> 04:33:15.746

APPRECIATE EVERYONE BEING HERE

04:33:29.025 --> 04:33:31.995
AND YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU.

04:33:32.062 --> 04:33:33.830
MY NAME IS JUDITH SULLIVAN AND

04:33:33.897 --> 04:33:37.901
I'M A BENICIA ACTIVIST AND I AM

04:33:37.968 --> 04:33:39.936
VERY DISTURBED ABOUT THE IDEA

04:33:40.003 --> 04:33:43.340
OF NOT HAVING SEQUA. AND AT THE

04:33:43.406 --> 04:33:44.674
FEDERAL LEVEL, THEY'RE GETTING

04:33:44.741 --> 04:33:46.977
RID OF EPA. THEY'RE GETTING RID

04:33:47.043 --> 04:33:48.745
OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS,

04:33:48.812 --> 04:33:51.047
AND THEY FEEL LIKE THAT

04:33:51.114 --> 04:33:52.516
CORPORATIONS SHOULD REGULATE

04:33:52.582 --> 04:33:55.385
THEMSELVES. AND HAVING LIVED

04:33:55.452 --> 04:33:57.687
UNDER VALERO FOR 46 YEARS IN

04:33:57.754 --> 04:33:59.856
BENICIA AND BEEN A WATCHDOG,

04:33:59.923 --> 04:34:01.892
I'VE BEEN TO YOUR HEARINGS MANY

04:34:01.958 --> 04:34:04.761
TIMES, SPOKEN, WRITTEN, CALLED.

04:34:04.828 --> 04:34:06.663
I REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED A

04:34:06.730 --> 04:34:10.233
FIRM HAND ON THIS, AND WE DON'T

04:34:10.300 --> 04:34:11.601
TRUST VALERO. THEY'VE NOT BEEN

04:34:11.668 --> 04:34:13.904
HONEST WITH US. I WAS ONE OF

04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:14.871
THE PEOPLE WHO READ THE

04:34:14.938 --> 04:34:16.540
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND

04:34:16.606 --> 04:34:18.809
REPORTED ON IT. WE FOUND MANY

04:34:18.875 --> 04:34:20.777
SINS OF OMISSION. WE FOUND MANY

04:34:20.844 --> 04:34:23.547
LIES AND LOTS OF CONTRADICTIONS,

04:34:23.613 --> 04:34:24.614
WHICH WE POINTED OUT. I DON'T

04:34:24.681 --> 04:34:27.717
THINK WE CAN TRUST THEM IF THEY

04:34:27.784 --> 04:34:29.719
DON'T HAVE THESE GUARDRAILS.

04:34:29.786 --> 04:34:31.688
AND WE SEE THE FEDERAL

04:34:31.755 --> 04:34:32.756
GOVERNMENT TAKING AWAY OUR

04:34:32.823 --> 04:34:33.757
GUARDRAILS, I FEEL LIKE

04:34:33.824 --> 04:34:34.891
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO STAND

04:34:34.958 --> 04:34:37.494
STRONG. WE ARE A CLIMATE ACTION

04:34:37.561 --> 04:34:40.997
STATE. LET'S PROVE IT. LET'S

04:34:41.064 --> 04:34:44.067
NOT LET'S NOT DEREGULATE THE

04:34:44.134 --> 04:34:47.070
THE THE INDUSTRY THAT IS

04:34:47.137 --> 04:34:50.073
POLLUTING US. ALSO, I FOLLOW

04:34:50.140 --> 04:34:51.541
THE THANK YOU MA'AM. OKAY.

04:34:51.608 --> 04:34:54.778
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:34:54.845 --> 04:34:56.880
MY NAME IS NANCY REISER. I'M

04:34:56.947 --> 04:34:59.015
FROM THE SMALL TOWN OF CROCKETT

04:34:59.082 --> 04:35:00.650
IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY,

04:35:00.717 --> 04:35:03.820
DOWNWIND FROM PHILLIPS 66 AND

04:35:03.887 --> 04:35:05.655
ACROSS THE WATERS OF THE

04:35:05.722 --> 04:35:09.226
CARQUINEZ STRAIT FROM BENICIA.

04:35:09.292 --> 04:35:11.228
LOOK, INCREASING OIL DRILLING

04:35:11.294 --> 04:35:14.164
IN KERN COUNTY WILL NOT HELP

04:35:14.231 --> 04:35:17.167
LOWER GAS PRICES BECAUSE OF

04:35:17.234 --> 04:35:18.568
CALIFORNIA'S GEOLOGY. THE

04:35:18.635 --> 04:35:20.770
STATE'S OIL PRODUCTION DOES NOT

04:35:20.837 --> 04:35:23.440
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

04:35:23.506 --> 04:35:27.244
OIL PRICES. FURTHER,

04:35:27.310 --> 04:35:30.180
HISTORICALLY, THE OIL INDUSTRY

04:35:30.247 --> 04:35:32.415
HAS LEFT THE STATE ON THE HOOK

04:35:32.482 --> 04:35:33.950
FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

04:35:34.017 --> 04:35:36.987
CLEAN UP COSTS, WHICH BRINGS UP

04:35:37.053 --> 04:35:39.723
THE ISSUE OF THE THOUSANDS OF

04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:43.426
UNPLUGGED WELLS. FURTHER

04:35:43.493 --> 04:35:45.395
EXPANSION WILL INCREASE THE

04:35:45.462 --> 04:35:48.164
STATE'S ECONOMIC RISK OF

04:35:48.231 --> 04:35:53.470
STRANDED ASSETS AND CEQA

04:35:53.536 --> 04:35:56.706
EXEMPTIONS WILL COLDLY THROW

04:35:56.773 --> 04:35:58.375
THE HEALTH OF FENCELINE

04:35:58.441 --> 04:36:00.810
COMMUNITIES UNDER THE BUS. AND

04:36:00.877 --> 04:36:03.013
IN CLOSING, I ASK YOU THIS WHY

04:36:03.079 --> 04:36:04.781
EXPOSE OUR LIMITED DOLLARS TO

04:36:04.848 --> 04:36:07.851
SUCH RISKS AS OPPOSED TO

04:36:07.918 --> 04:36:10.687

THROUGH ALL THESE HOURS. SO MY

04:39:02.859 --> 04:39:04.094
QUESTION IS, HOW ARE YOU GOING

04:39:04.160 --> 04:39:06.396
TO STABILIZE PRODUCTION WHEN

04:39:06.463 --> 04:39:07.997
YOU'VE LOST THE PRODUCERS?

04:39:08.064 --> 04:39:09.766
CHEVRON'S GONE. THEY WENT TO

04:39:09.833 --> 04:39:11.067
IRAQ. THEY JUST ANNOUNCED A

04:39:11.134 --> 04:39:12.502
DEAL TODAY WITH IRAQ. THEY'RE

04:39:12.569 --> 04:39:14.504
GOING TO PRODUCE AN IRAQ WHERE

04:39:14.571 --> 04:39:16.506
THEY FLARE 15,000,000,000M³ OF

04:39:16.573 --> 04:39:18.842
NATURAL GAS A YEAR AND THEN PUT

04:39:18.908 --> 04:39:21.177
IT ON A TANKER SHIP AND BRING

04:39:21.244 --> 04:39:21.744
IT TO OUR PORTS. CARB SAYS

04:39:21.811 --> 04:39:24.180
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 2 TO 5

04:39:24.247 --> 04:39:25.548
TIMES MORE TANKERS DELIVERING

04:39:25.615 --> 04:39:27.750
PRODUCT TO OUR PORTS BY 2040.

04:39:27.817 --> 04:39:29.018
THAT'S GOING TO DEVASTATE THE

04:39:29.085 --> 04:39:30.687
AIR QUALITY IN THE COMMUNITIES.

04:39:30.753 --> 04:39:33.223
AS THESE REFINERIES CLOSE, IT'S

04:39:33.289 --> 04:39:35.091
GOING TO GET WORSE, NOT BETTER.

04:39:35.158 --> 04:39:41.164
THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS,

04:39:41.231 --> 04:39:42.098

AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY.

04:39:53.109 --> 04:39:54.878
I'M OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S

04:39:54.944 --> 04:39:58.047

04:39:58.114 --> 04:39:58.948
FROM THE SEQUA ENVIRONMENTAL

04:39:59.015 --> 04:40:00.817
REVIEW REQUIREMENTS. AND MY

04:40:00.884 --> 04:40:01.751
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT GOES

04:40:01.818 --> 04:40:03.720
THE PROPOSAL GOES BEYOND JUST

04:40:03.786 --> 04:40:05.922
KERN COUNTY, BUT WOULD ALSO

04:40:05.989 --> 04:40:06.556
INCLUDE OTHER LARGE SECTIONS OF

04:40:06.623 --> 04:40:08.391
THE STATE. AND I'M JUST

04:40:08.458 --> 04:40:09.626
CONCERNED THAT IT WILL

04:40:09.692 --> 04:40:11.794
NEGATIVELY IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH,

04:40:11.861 --> 04:40:12.529
ESPECIALLY IN FRONTLINE

04:40:12.595 --> 04:40:15.064
COMMUNITIES, AND REDUCE PUBLIC

04:40:15.131 --> 04:40:15.899
TRANSPARENCY, TRANSPARENCY AND

04:40:15.965 --> 04:40:17.667
AWARENESS OF HEALTH RISKS AND

04:40:17.734 --> 04:40:18.768
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. I'M ALSO

04:40:18.835 --> 04:40:20.570
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

04:40:20.637 --> 04:40:22.839
POSSIBLE WEAKENING OF OFFSHORE

04:40:22.906 --> 04:40:24.274
OIL DRILLING PROTECTIONS AND

04:40:24.340 --> 04:40:25.608
POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR OCEAN

04:40:25.675 --> 04:40:28.211
AND OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

04:40:28.278 --> 04:40:29.145
AND FINALLY, THE PROPOSAL JUST

04:40:29.212 --> 04:40:30.713
SEEMS TO ME TO BE GOING IN THE

04:40:30.780 --> 04:40:32.916
OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED

04:40:32.982 --> 04:40:33.983
TO BE GOING RIGHT NOW TO

04:40:34.050 --> 04:40:35.718
PROMOTE A JUST AND RAPID

04:40:35.785 --> 04:40:37.287
TRANSITION AWAY FROM A FOSSIL

04:40:37.353 --> 04:40:38.922
FUEL ECONOMY TO RENEWABLE FUELS.

04:40:38.988 --> 04:40:41.191
AND I AND I KNOW IT'S BEING

04:40:41.257 --> 04:40:42.825
PROPOSED AS A WAY OF DEALING

04:40:42.892 --> 04:40:44.427
WITH MARKET UNCERTAINTIES IN

04:40:44.494 --> 04:40:45.695
THE TRANSITION, BUT IT COULD

04:40:45.762 --> 04:40:47.096
BECOME A WAY OF BACKTRACKING

04:40:47.163 --> 04:40:50.133
FROM THE TRANSITION ITSELF. I

04:40:50.200 --> 04:40:52.869
JUST HOPE THE LEGISLATURE WILL.

04:40:52.936 --> 04:40:56.773
GOALS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI,

AND THE COMMUNITY WE WORK WITH

04:41:03.746 --> 04:41:06.916
AND HAVE MEMBERS, AND THEY HAVE

04:41:06.983 --> 04:41:09.185
A MASSIVE OIL LAKE UNDER THE

04:41:09.252 --> 04:41:10.220
NOW CLOSING PHILLIPS 66

04:41:10.286 --> 04:41:12.088
REFINERY IN LA, ABOVE ITS

04:41:12.155 --> 04:41:13.990

04:41:14.057 --> 04:41:15.458
CONTAMINANTS LEACHING INTO THE

04:41:15.525 --> 04:41:17.860

TAXPAYERS FROM MASSIVE FUTURE

04:41:20.763 --> 04:41:22.966
COSTS, THE LEGISLATURE MUST

04:41:23.032 --> 04:41:25.034
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ASKING

04:41:25.101 --> 04:41:25.902
FOR OIL COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE

04:41:25.969 --> 04:41:27.804
THEIR REFINERY CLEANUP COSTS.

04:41:27.870 --> 04:41:29.405
WE ALSO ASK FOR PROPER

04:41:29.472 --> 04:41:29.906

04:41:40.850 --> 04:41:43.386
THAT IT'S WELL PLANNED. THAT

04:41:43.453 --> 04:41:44.687
PUTS THE COMMUNITY AND THE

CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL

04:41:56.299 --> 04:41:57.834
JUSTICE ALLIANCE OR ACTION. I

04:41:57.900 --> 04:41:59.535
WANT TO FIRST ALIGN OUR

04:41:59.602 --> 04:42:01.137
COMMENTS TODAY WITH THOSE

04:42:01.204 --> 04:42:02.105
SHARED BY THE PANELISTS FROM

04:42:02.171 --> 04:42:04.040
CCE, CHEN, AND JUST USE A

04:42:04.107 --> 04:42:05.642
LITTLE BIT OF THE TIME TO TALK

04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:07.710
MORE ABOUT THE SQL ROLLBACKS.

04:42:07.777 --> 04:42:09.078
AS YOU ALL ARE ALREADY AWARE,

04:42:09.145 --> 04:42:10.613
THIS HAS BEEN A YEAR OF A TON

04:42:10.680 --> 04:42:12.782
OF SQL ACTION. WE'VE SEEN

04:42:12.849 --> 04:42:13.783
UNPRECEDENTED ROLLBACKS THROUGH

04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:15.652
THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR,

04:42:15.718 --> 04:42:16.953
AND EVEN WHEN WE'RE TALKING

04:42:17.020 --> 04:42:18.354
ABOUT THESE ROLLBACKS,

04:42:18.421 --> 04:42:19.522
PROPONENTS OF THE EXEMPTIONS

04:42:19.589 --> 04:42:21.858
WILL SAY SQL STILL HAS A ROLE.

04:42:21.924 --> 04:42:23.026
SQL STILL HAS A PURPOSE. IT

04:42:23.092 --> 04:42:23.860
DOES PROVIDE CRITICAL

04:42:23.926 --> 04:42:25.795
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. I DON'T

04:42:25.862 --> 04:42:26.963
THINK THEY EVER THOUGHT THAT

04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:28.564
THIS WOULD INCLUDE OIL DRILLING.

04:42:28.631 --> 04:42:30.233
I THINK NO ONE WOULD ARGUE THAT

04:42:30.300 --> 04:42:32.635
OIL DRILLING HAS A MAJOR IMPACT

04:42:32.702 --> 04:42:33.770
ON COMMUNITIES, ON THE

04:42:33.836 --> 04:42:35.805
ENVIRONMENT, AND IS WORTHY OF

04:42:35.872 --> 04:42:37.006
FULL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

04:42:37.073 --> 04:42:39.175
MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT ASPECT

04:42:39.242 --> 04:42:41.144
OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE A

04:42:41.210 --> 04:42:42.111
COMPLETE BETRAYAL TO EXTRACTION

04:42:42.178 --> 04:42:43.780
COMMUNITIES, AND I ALSO WANT TO

04:42:43.846 --> 04:42:45.782

04:42:46.983 --> 04:42:50.119
FOR A MANAGED DECLINE TO BE

04:42:50.186 --> 04:42:51.487

04:43:06.803 --> 04:43:07.937
COMMUNITIES. THAT MEANS

04:43:08.004 --> 04:43:08.738
PROTECTING HEALTH PROTECTION

04:43:08.805 --> 04:43:10.973
ZONES, LIMITING DRILLING AND

04:43:11.040 --> 04:43:13.176

INCREASE SUPPLY OR STABILIZE

04:43:25.822 --> 04:43:27.690
PRICES. OIL PRODUCTION HERE HAS

04:43:27.757 --> 04:43:29.759
BEEN DECLINING FOR 40 YEARS.

04:43:29.826 --> 04:43:31.561
EVEN WHEN KERN HAD NO

04:43:31.627 --> 04:43:32.729
RESTRICTIONS, STATE OIL

04:43:32.795 --> 04:43:34.130
PRODUCTION STILL DECLINED. THE

04:43:34.197 --> 04:43:35.665
QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH DAMAGE

04:43:35.732 --> 04:43:38.034
WILL THE STATE LET IT DO TO US

04:43:38.101 --> 04:43:39.268
ON ITS WAY OUT THE DOOR?

04:43:39.335 --> 04:43:40.203
CONTAMINATION IS REPORTEDLY

04:43:40.269 --> 04:43:42.705
16FT THICK AT THE PHILLIPS 66

04:43:42.772 --> 04:43:44.040
SITE. CLEANUP WILL TAKE DECADES

04:43:44.107 --> 04:43:45.775
AND COST MILLIONS. WE HAVE

04:43:45.842 --> 04:43:47.877
TOOLS THE LEGISLATURE CAN AND

04:43:47.944 --> 04:43:50.146
MUST DIRECT CDC TO COMPLETE AND

04:43:50.213 --> 04:43:51.114
IMPLEMENT THE RULEMAKING TO

04:43:51.180 --> 04:43:52.315

REPORTING REQUIRED. THE ONLY

04:43:55.852 --> 04:43:57.787
AND THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAY OUT

04:43:57.854 --> 04:44:00.256
IS TO ACCELERATE THE CLEAN, THE

04:44:00.323 --> 04:44:01.924
CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. AND

04:44:01.991 --> 04:44:03.760
VERY QUICKLY. I JUST WANT TO

04:44:03.826 --> 04:44:05.862
SPEAK TO THE TWO FOR ONE SCHEME.

04:44:05.928 --> 04:44:06.696
WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE

04:44:06.763 --> 04:44:09.132

04:44:09.198 --> 04:44:09.999
OF THAT HAVING THE OPPOSITE

04:44:10.066 --> 04:44:11.601
EFFECT AND DELAYING PLUGGING IN

04:44:11.667 --> 04:44:12.835
HEALTH PROTECTION ZONES. AND

04:44:12.902 --> 04:44:14.804
THAT'S A LITTLE LONGER THAN I

04:44:14.871 --> 04:44:16.773
HAVE TIME FOR HERE, SO I WILL

04:44:16.839 --> 04:44:17.940
FOLLOW UP. BUT AS THE GOVERNOR

04:44:18.007 --> 04:44:19.542
SAID, I'D LIKE TO LEAVE THIS

04:44:19.609 --> 04:44:20.610
WITH YOU. POLLUTION BASED

04:44:20.676 --> 04:44:22.278
PROSPERITY IS AN ILLUSION. IT

04:44:22.345 --> 04:44:25.681
IS A LIE. THANK YOU. GOOD

04:44:25.748 --> 04:44:26.983

CALIFORNIA'S RELIANCE ON

04:44:40.763 --> 04:44:42.331
GASOLINE. THAT MEANS INVESTING

04:44:42.398 --> 04:44:43.633
IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES, BOOSTING

04:44:43.699 --> 04:44:45.768
FUEL IMPORTS TO INCREASE

04:44:45.835 --> 04:44:46.903

04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:54.777
IT PROVIDES THE STATE WITH MORE

FLEXIBILITY IN STABILIZING

04:44:56.112 --> 04:44:58.881

04:48:57.753 --> 04:48:59.588
COME FROM WORKING INSIDE OF

04:48:59.655 --> 04:49:00.656
THESE REFINERIES. IT'S OUR JOB

04:49:00.723 --> 04:49:03.659

04:49:03.726 --> 04:49:05.528

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I AM

04:49:17.840 --> 04:49:19.041
FEARFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE

04:49:19.108 --> 04:49:20.743
GOING TO HAVE SUPPLY SHORTAGES

04:49:20.810 --> 04:49:22.712

ROAD AND GETTING OUR SUPPLY

04:49:24.080 --> 04:49:25.848
FROM SOMEPLACE ELSE IS REALLY

04:49:25.915 --> 04:49:28.150
JUST PUTTING THE POLLUTANTS

04:49:28.217 --> 04:49:28.884
INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S BACKYARD.

04:49:28.951 --> 04:49:29.719
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT

04:49:29.785 --> 04:49:32.221
CALIFORNIA STANDS FOR. THANK

04:49:39.795 --> 04:49:41.864
WOULD JUST ALSO NOTE THAT THIS

04:49:41.931 --> 04:49:42.598
IS AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS.

04:49:42.665 --> 04:49:44.800
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF

04:49:44.867 --> 04:49:46.001
AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS BY

04:49:46.068 --> 04:49:47.670
PUTTING IT ON THE BACKS OF THE

EXPERIENCE WITH MERGERS AND

04:51:53.195 --> 04:51:55.064
MERGERS HAPPEN. IT'S BECAUSE OF

04:56:07.583 --> 04:56:09.151

WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT

04:57:11.113 --> 04:57:14.049
COULD BE TRANSITIONED INTO OUR

04:57:14.116 --> 04:57:16.485
GREEN ECONOMY, WHICH IS REALLY

04:57:16.552 --> 04:57:18.854
MUCH MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE

04:57:18.921 --> 04:57:20.389
VALUES OF CALIFORNIANS. I'M

04:57:20.455 --> 04:57:21.890
AFRAID THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL,

04:57:21.957 --> 04:57:23.825
WHICH I FIRMLY OPPOSE, IS WAY

04:57:23.892 --> 04:57:25.928
OUT OF TOUCH WITH WHAT MOST

04:57:25.994 --> 04:57:28.697
CALIFORNIANS WANT AND

04:57:28.764 --> 04:57:29.865
CONTRADICTS OUR VALUES OF

04:57:29.932 --> 04:57:31.633
RESPECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT. SO

04:57:31.700 --> 04:57:34.469
LET'S PUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND

04:57:34.536 --> 04:57:37.206
THE ECONOMY AND JOBS TOGETHER

04:57:37.272 --> 04:57:38.874
INSTEAD OF IN OPPOSITION. THANK

04:57:38.941 --> 04:57:42.878
YOU. THANK YOU. HI. GOOD

04:57:42.945 --> 04:57:44.546
EVENING. GRISHINA MOHABEER WITH

04:57:44.613 --> 04:57:45.747
CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS.

04:57:45.814 --> 04:57:47.916
I JUST WANT TO REITERATE A FEW

04:57:47.983 --> 04:57:50.385
KEY POINTS ABOUT THE MANAGED

04:57:50.452 --> 04:57:51.787
DECLINE CONVERSATION. FIRST AND

04:57:51.853 --> 04:57:53.021
FOREMOST, THE BURDEN OF OIL

04:57:53.088 --> 04:57:54.623
DRILLING HEALTH HARMS ARE

04:57:54.690 --> 04:57:56.091
DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY

04:57:56.158 --> 04:57:57.492
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, AND

04:57:57.559 --> 04:57:58.961
IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE TO

04:57:59.027 --> 04:58:00.062
EXPAND PRODUCTION WITHOUT

04:58:00.128 --> 04:58:02.097
ENSURING AIR QUALITY, BENEFITS

04:58:02.164 --> 04:58:03.632
AND PROTECTIONS FOR EXTRACTION

04:58:03.699 --> 04:58:04.933
COMMUNITIES. AS WE WEIGH WHAT

04:58:05.000 --> 04:58:07.603
OUR SUPPLY SIDE OPTIONS ARE.

04:58:07.669 --> 04:58:08.804
ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST ALSO

04:58:08.870 --> 04:58:10.672
FOCUS ON THE DEMAND SIDE

04:58:10.739 --> 04:58:13.108
STRATEGIES THAT LESSEN OUR

04:58:13.175 --> 04:58:14.343
RELIANCE ON THIS DWINDLING FUEL

04:58:14.409 --> 04:58:15.744
SUPPLY, BOLSTERING CALIFORNIA'S

04:58:15.811 --> 04:58:17.980
ZEV TRANSITION, ESPECIALLY

04:58:18.046 --> 04:58:18.780
ACCESS FOR DISADVANTAGED

04:58:18.847 --> 04:58:20.582
COMMUNITIES IS CRITICAL. WE

04:58:20.649 --> 04:58:23.185
REALLY WANT THESE OPTIONS TO BE

04:58:23.252 --> 04:58:24.553
AFFORDABLE AND APPEALING FOR

04:58:24.620 --> 04:58:26.855
ALL CALIFORNIANS. LASTLY,

04:58:26.922 --> 04:58:28.824
FUTURE REFINERY CLOSURES MUST

04:58:28.890 --> 04:58:29.625
HAVE BETTER PROTOCOLS SO WE

04:58:29.691 --> 04:58:31.860
DON'T END UP IN THIS SITUATION

04:58:31.927 --> 04:58:33.895
AGAIN. THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE

04:58:33.962 --> 04:58:35.163
REQUIRING FULL ASSET RETIREMENT

04:58:35.230 --> 04:58:36.331
OBLIGATIONS. REPORTING AND

04:58:36.398 --> 04:58:37.399
DISCLOSURE ABOUT REMEDIATION

04:58:37.466 --> 04:58:39.701
NEEDS FROM THE REFINERIES AND A

04:58:39.768 --> 04:58:41.503
FUND FOR DISPLACED WORKERS. SO

04:58:41.570 --> 04:58:43.605
WE'RE PURSUING THE HOLISTIC

04:58:43.672 --> 04:58:44.906
TRANSITION, RIGHT. THANK YOU.

04:58:44.973 --> 04:58:50.078
THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING, MADAM

04:58:50.145 --> 04:58:51.713
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M DIRK

04:58:51.780 --> 04:58:53.649
FULTON. I'M A LIFELONG BENICIA

04:58:53.715 --> 04:58:55.284
RESIDENT. I WAS THERE BEFORE

04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:57.619
THE REFINERY, SERVED 16 YEARS,

04:58:57.686 --> 04:58:58.820
ELECTED IN LOCAL OFFICE THERE,

04:58:58.887 --> 04:59:01.990
INCLUDING A TERM AS VICE MAYOR.

04:59:02.057 --> 04:59:02.891
I'M HERE TO OPPOSE. AND WE

04:59:02.958 --> 04:59:05.093
OPPOSE A GROUP THAT I'VE WORKED

04:59:05.160 --> 04:59:06.628
WITH ACTIVELY ON THIS, THE

04:59:06.695 --> 04:59:08.764
STATE EFFORTS TO KEEP THIS

04:59:08.830 --> 04:59:10.766
VALERO REFINERY OPEN. IT WE'VE

04:59:10.832 --> 04:59:13.769
BEEN A SACRIFICIAL LAMB FOR 55

04:59:13.835 --> 04:59:16.705
YEARS AND IT'S POISONOUS. OUR

04:59:16.772 --> 04:59:18.974
CANCER RATES FOR BREAST CANCER

04:59:19.041 --> 04:59:20.776
ARE 92% HIGHER THAN THE STATE

04:59:20.842 --> 04:59:22.611
AVERAGES. OUR PROSTATE CANCER

04:59:22.678 --> 04:59:25.647
RATES ARE 76% HIGHER THAN THE

04:59:25.714 --> 04:59:27.015
STATE AVERAGES. OUR CHILDREN

04:59:27.082 --> 04:59:28.583
ASTHMA RATES ARE OFF THE CHARTS.

04:59:28.650 --> 04:59:30.719
WE HAVE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS

04:59:30.786 --> 04:59:33.155
GETTING SICK AND DYING LEFT AND

04:59:33.221 --> 04:59:34.656
RIGHT. SO WE'RE WE'RE

04:59:34.723 --> 04:59:35.924
VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO IT

04:59:35.991 --> 04:59:38.960
CONTINUING CONTINUING OPERATION

04:59:39.027 --> 04:59:43.098
PAST THIS COMING APRIL. I'VE

04:59:43.165 --> 04:59:45.901
LOOKED AT THE CDC ANALYSIS ON

04:59:45.967 --> 04:59:47.936
DEMAND AND SUPPLY. WE HAD EARLY

04:59:48.003 --> 04:59:50.238
NUMBERS THAT THEY PUT OUT AT

04:59:50.305 --> 04:59:51.807
THE END OF MAY. THANK YOU.

04:59:51.873 --> 04:59:53.909
THAT'S THAT'S MY MINUTE. THAT'S

04:59:53.975 --> 04:59:55.677
IT. YES. OKAY. BUT YES, AS AS I

04:59:55.744 --> 04:59:57.746
SAID TO EARLIER SPEAKERS AND

04:59:57.813 --> 04:59:58.714
FOR ANYONE ELSE, IF YOU HAVEN'T

04:59:58.780 --> 05:00:00.582
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE ALL

05:00:00.649 --> 05:00:01.983
OF YOUR INPUT PARTY EMAIL,

05:00:02.050 --> 05:00:04.586
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT THIS WITH

05:00:04.653 --> 05:00:07.789
THE INITIATIVE FOR TAXATION AND

05:00:07.856 --> 05:00:09.091
REZONE THE REFINERY PROPERTY.

05:00:09.157 --> 05:00:13.595
THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. MY

05:00:13.662 --> 05:00:15.797
NAME IS JULIA SEBASTIAN FOR THE

05:00:15.864 --> 05:00:17.432
CALIFORNIA LABOR FOR CLIMATE

05:00:17.499 --> 05:00:18.934
JOBS, A STATEWIDE COALITION OF

05:00:19.000 --> 05:00:22.604
LABOR UNIONS, AND JUST WANT TO

05:00:22.671 --> 05:00:24.239
VOICE SUPPORT FOR A FUNCTIONAL

05:00:24.306 --> 05:00:25.507
COMPREHENSION, COMPREHENSIVE

05:00:25.574 --> 05:00:26.708
AND REALLY NATION LEADING

05:00:26.775 --> 05:00:28.744
PROGRAM FOR OIL AND GAS WORKERS

05:00:28.810 --> 05:00:30.612
FACING DISPLACEMENT. SO REALLY,

05:00:30.679 --> 05:00:31.813
THAT THIRD CATEGORY THAT THE

05:00:31.880 --> 05:00:34.883
CÁC TALKED ABOUT, JUST TO NAME,

05:00:34.950 --> 05:00:35.717
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

05:00:35.784 --> 05:00:36.852
MANY PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE

05:00:36.918 --> 05:00:39.121
FOCUSED ON STABILIZING SUPPLY.

05:00:39.187 --> 05:00:41.690
OF COURSE. HOWEVER, THERE IS

05:00:41.757 --> 05:00:42.991
NOT AN EXPLICIT PROPOSAL IN

05:00:43.058 --> 05:00:44.693
THAT PACKAGE FOR WORKERS WHO

05:00:44.760 --> 05:00:47.028
ARE ALREADY FACING LAYOFF.

05:00:47.095 --> 05:00:48.997
RIGHT. SO A TRANSITION PROGRAM

05:00:49.064 --> 05:00:50.699
FOR WORKERS NOT ONLY ENSURES

05:00:50.766 --> 05:00:52.401
WORKERS CAN INTEGRATE INTO THE

05:00:52.467 --> 05:00:53.702
FUTURE ECONOMY, BUT ALSO WHO

05:00:53.769 --> 05:00:55.871
ARE ALREADY FACING LAYOFF, BUT

05:00:55.937 --> 05:00:57.539
ALSO IS NECESSARY IF WE HOPE TO

05:00:57.606 --> 05:00:59.674
MAINTAIN STAFF AT REFINERIES

05:00:59.741 --> 05:01:01.676
WHILE THEY ARE DECOMMISSIONING.

05:01:01.743 --> 05:01:03.645
THAT IS CRITICAL. NOT ONLY LIKE

05:01:03.712 --> 05:01:05.814
THAT, PROPERLY STAFFING OF

05:01:05.881 --> 05:01:08.650
REFINERIES IS CRITICAL DURING

05:01:08.717 --> 05:01:09.951
DECOMMISSIONING, NOT ONLY TO

05:01:10.018 --> 05:01:10.752
PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH DURING

05:01:10.819 --> 05:01:12.687
EXPLOSIONS. ALL THE THINGS THAT

05:01:12.754 --> 05:01:14.289
HAVE HAPPENED THAT PEOPLE HAVE

05:01:14.356 --> 05:01:14.990
NAMED, BUT ALSO TO PREVENT

05:01:15.056 --> 05:01:16.792
UNPLANNED OUTAGES THAT LEAD TO

05:01:16.858 --> 05:01:18.326
PRICE SPIKES. THERE IS AN

05:01:18.393 --> 05:01:20.562
ACTIVE PROPOSAL, SO PLEASE LOOK

05:01:20.629 --> 05:01:23.965
OUT FOR THAT. THANK YOU. THANK

05:01:24.032 --> 05:01:27.803
YOU. GOOD EVENING. I'M LYNN

05:01:27.869 --> 05:01:28.937
GRIFFITH, A RETIRED TEACHER

05:01:29.004 --> 05:01:30.872
FROM OAKLAND. I WANT TO THANK

05:01:30.939 --> 05:01:31.940
THE FEW OF YOU WHO HAVE

05:01:32.007 --> 05:01:33.875
SURVIVED, CLAIRE, TILL PUBLIC

05:01:33.942 --> 05:01:36.278
COMMENT FOR STAYING AROUND TO

05:01:36.344 --> 05:01:39.047
HEAR US. IT'S NICE TO BE HEARD.

05:01:39.114 --> 05:01:40.682
I WORK WITH CALIFORNIA

05:01:40.749 --> 05:01:42.684
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COALITION

05:01:42.751 --> 05:01:45.821
AND 2 OR 3 OTHER GROUPS AS WELL.

05:01:45.887 --> 05:01:46.588
THE ENVIRONMENT IS VERY

05:01:46.655 --> 05:01:49.324
IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE

05:01:49.391 --> 05:01:51.526
LIVING NEAR THESE AREAS. SO OIL

05:01:51.593 --> 05:01:52.727
FIELD WORKERS WILL GET OTHER

05:01:52.794 --> 05:01:55.230
JOBS. THEY CAN WORK. I

05:01:55.297 --> 05:01:55.764
UNDERSTAND THE SKILLS ARE

05:01:55.831 --> 05:01:57.799
SIMILAR TO GEOTHERMAL. THERE

05:01:57.866 --> 05:02:00.168
ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO MAKE A

05:02:00.235 --> 05:02:01.269
BETTER TRANSITION THAN THIS

05:02:01.336 --> 05:02:06.174
PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

05:02:06.241 --> 05:02:08.777
HELLO, ALICE TI¾N, A RESIDENT

05:02:08.844 --> 05:02:12.614
OF SAN JOSE. IT SEEMS VERY

05:02:12.681 --> 05:02:15.050
NAIVE TO SAY THAT INCREASING

05:02:15.116 --> 05:02:18.386
SUPPLY WILL STABILIZE PRICES.

05:02:18.453 --> 05:02:21.022
SINCE 2017, THE US HAS BEEN THE

05:02:21.089 --> 05:02:22.991
TOP OIL AND GAS PRODUCER IN THE

05:02:23.058 --> 05:02:26.595
WORLD. AND LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED

05:02:26.661 --> 05:02:28.296
TO NATIONAL RETAIL PRICES.

05:02:28.363 --> 05:02:30.098
TROUBLED, DOUBLED, DOUBLED OR

05:02:30.165 --> 05:02:32.467
TRIPLED. I AM FIRMLY OPPOSED TO

05:02:32.534 --> 05:02:35.604
THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO SAY THAT

05:02:35.670 --> 05:02:38.039
WE WILL EXEMPT THEM COMPLETELY

05:02:38.106 --> 05:02:39.741
FROM SEQUA, FROM COMPLETELY

05:02:39.808 --> 05:02:42.577
FROM PUBLIC REVIEW, AND SAY

05:02:42.644 --> 05:02:44.980
THAT IN RETURN, ALL THAT THEY

05:02:45.046 --> 05:02:46.615
HAVE TO DO IS COMPLY WITH

05:02:46.681 --> 05:02:49.050
EXISTING LAW. THAT IS NOT A

05:02:49.117 --> 05:02:51.219
HOLISTIC SOLUTION, AS

05:02:51.286 --> 05:02:52.754
CHARACTERIZED BY CAL JAM. THAT

05:02:52.821 --> 05:02:56.191
IS A COMPLETE FREE PASS AND A

05:02:56.258 --> 05:02:58.927
COMPLETE CAPITULATION. THANK

05:02:58.994 --> 05:03:03.965
YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING.

05:03:04.032 --> 05:03:06.635
VICTORIA ROEHM WITH NRDC. AND I

05:03:06.701 --> 05:03:08.970
WANT TO FIRST JUST ECHO THE

05:03:09.037 --> 05:03:10.171
COMMENTS OF THE OTHER

05:03:10.238 --> 05:03:11.673
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL

05:03:11.740 --> 05:03:14.042
JUSTICE SPEAKERS HERE TODAY AND

05:03:14.109 --> 05:03:16.778
VERY QUICKLY SPEAK TO A BILL

05:03:16.845 --> 05:03:18.647
THAT MANY OF YOU VOTED FOR LESS

05:03:18.713 --> 05:03:20.482
THAN TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH WAS

05:03:20.549 --> 05:03:22.984
AB 1167. AND THAT LAW IS

05:03:23.051 --> 05:03:24.719
DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE OIL

05:03:24.786 --> 05:03:26.988
INDUSTRY, NOT THE TAXPAYERS,

05:03:27.055 --> 05:03:28.657
PAY FOR THE SAFE CLOSURE OF

05:03:28.723 --> 05:03:30.325
WELLS THAT ARE NO LONGER

05:03:30.392 --> 05:03:32.327
PRODUCING. AND THERE ARE JOBS

05:03:32.394 --> 05:03:34.763
IN THAT INDUSTRY AS WELL. SO AS

05:03:34.829 --> 05:03:36.998
WE READ THE GOVERNOR'S OUR END,

05:03:37.065 --> 05:03:38.900
IT WEAKENS THAT LAW AND WOULD

05:03:38.967 --> 05:03:41.169
ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER

05:03:41.236 --> 05:03:42.137
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT. THANK YOU.

05:03:42.203 --> 05:03:46.708
THANK YOU. HELLO. MY NAME IS

05:03:46.775 --> 05:03:47.943

ON BEHALF OF COMMUNITIES FOR A

05:03:50.011 --> 05:03:51.613
BETTER ENVIRONMENT. WE ORGANIZE

05:03:51.680 --> 05:03:53.481
IN RICHMOND AND WILMINGTON

05:03:53.548 --> 05:03:54.683
REFINERY COMMUNITIES THAT, LIKE

05:03:54.749 --> 05:03:56.718
BENICIA, DESERVE CAREFUL

05:03:56.785 --> 05:03:57.886
TREATMENT AND PLANNING FOR A

05:03:57.953 --> 05:03:59.988
JUST TRANSITION. THE

05:04:00.055 --> 05:04:00.689
LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSE TO

05:04:00.755 --> 05:04:02.958
REFINERY CLOSURES MUST INCLUDE

05:04:03.024 --> 05:04:04.593
PLANNING FOR ONGOING

05:04:04.659 --> 05:04:05.927
TRANSITIONS, WHICH REQUIRES

05:04:05.994 --> 05:04:08.597
PUBLIC DISCLOSURES ABOUT SITE

05:04:08.663 --> 05:04:10.131
CONTAMINATION AND REMEDIATION

05:04:10.198 --> 05:04:11.933
NEEDS. THIS INCLUDES DATA

05:04:12.000 --> 05:04:14.102
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS LIKE

05:04:14.169 --> 05:04:17.939
LIKE CESAR AT CCJ IN KERN

05:04:18.006 --> 05:04:19.808
COUNTY, CBE ORGANIZES IN LA

05:04:19.874 --> 05:04:21.676
WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE

05:04:21.743 --> 05:04:22.877
TO ORGANIZE TO PROTECT

05:04:22.944 --> 05:04:23.678
COMMUNITIES FROM THE HEALTH

INVOLVEMENT GRANTED UNDER SEQUA

05:04:32.754 --> 05:04:35.590

ORGANIZING EXISTS IN A VACUUM.

05:04:36.958 --> 05:04:38.927
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

CANADIAN ALBERTAN TAR SANDS,

05:05:21.736 --> 05:05:23.538
AND IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE TO USE

05:05:23.605 --> 05:05:24.706
THERMALLY ENHANCED TECHNIQUES.

05:05:24.773 --> 05:05:26.541
WE HAVE TO BURN NATURAL GAS TO

05:05:26.608 --> 05:05:27.776
MAKE STEAM TO GET THE REMAINING

05:05:27.842 --> 05:05:29.744
CRUDE OIL OUT OF THE GROUND.

05:05:29.811 --> 05:05:31.780
WE'RE BETTER OFF IMPORTING LOW

HIGHER GASOLINE AND DIESEL

05:05:38.853 --> 05:05:42.490

CURRENT STATE OF OUR CLIMATE,

05:07:34.903 --> 05:07:35.670
IS IRRESPONSIBLE, BUT

05:07:35.737 --> 05:07:36.938
INCREASING OIL PRODUCTION

05:07:37.005 --> 05:07:38.473
WITHOUT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW,

05:07:38.540 --> 05:07:41.643
PUBLIC INPUT OR MITIGATION IS

MY NAME IS PHILIP MORTON. I'M A

05:07:56.291 --> 05:07:57.358
RESIDENT IN BERKELEY. I'M A US

05:07:57.425 --> 05:08:01.362
CITIZEN. I'M HERE IN FAVOR OF

05:08:01.429 --> 05:08:03.598
MAINTAINING THE PROTECTIONS FOR

05:08:03.665 --> 05:08:05.800
THE FOR EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA.

05:08:05.867 --> 05:08:07.569
I THINK THERE'S SOME ARGUMENTS

05:08:07.635 --> 05:08:09.904
WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN HEARD. LIKE

05:08:09.971 --> 05:08:11.639
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY OIL

05:08:11.706 --> 05:08:12.874
COMPANIES GOING BANKRUPT

05:08:12.941 --> 05:08:13.908
BECAUSE THEY'VE SPENT TOO MUCH

05:08:13.975 --> 05:08:15.476
MONEY ON LOOKING AFTER PEOPLE

05:08:15.543 --> 05:08:17.645
AND PAYING FOR THE COSTS OF THE

05:08:17.712 --> 05:08:22.050
HARM THAT THEY'VE DONE. WE ARE

05:08:22.116 --> 05:08:23.051
ALREADY IN A STATE WHERE PEOPLE

05:08:23.117 --> 05:08:25.687
ARE MOVING AWAY FROM OIL. THE

05:08:25.753 --> 05:08:27.922
SLIDE THAT WAS SHOWN SHOWED

05:08:27.989 --> 05:08:31.125
THAT, AND I JUST WANT TO FINISH

05:08:31.192 --> 05:08:31.926
OFF BY REMINDING EVERYBODY THAT

05:08:31.993 --> 05:08:33.928
IT'S TIME FOR TO MAKE THE

05:08:33.995 --> 05:08:42.270
POLLUTERS PAY. THANK YOU. FALLS

05:08:42.337 --> 05:08:43.771
DOWN. HI. CHEN WARREN FROM

05:08:43.838 --> 05:08:46.541
WALNUT CREEK. WE NEED TO

05:08:46.608 --> 05:08:47.709
REMEMBER THAT THE REAL CRISIS

05:08:47.775 --> 05:08:51.412
BEFORE US IS THE CLIMATE CRISIS.

05:08:51.479 --> 05:08:53.014
DRILLING MORE OIL, DRILLING

05:08:53.081 --> 05:08:55.516
MORE WELLS WILL HARM AND THE

05:08:55.583 --> 05:08:59.120
PEOPLE AND THE PLANET. THE REAL

05:08:59.187 --> 05:09:00.555
REASON THE REFINERIES CAN'T

05:09:00.622 --> 05:09:02.690
COMPETE AND THEY CHOOSE TO

05:09:02.757 --> 05:09:04.459
CLOSE, IS THAT NEWER ONES ARE

05:09:04.525 --> 05:09:05.727
MORE EFFICIENT, AND THEY CAN

05:09:05.793 --> 05:09:07.762
MAKE MORE MONEY WITH NEWER ONES.

05:09:07.829 --> 05:09:08.997
IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION, AND

05:09:09.063 --> 05:09:11.733
THAT SEEMS REASONABLE. THE

05:09:11.799 --> 05:09:12.967
FOSSIL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN LYING

05:09:13.034 --> 05:09:16.037
TO US SINCE THE 1950S. SOUND

05:09:16.104 --> 05:09:17.839
FAMILIAR? IF YOU DON'T GIVE US

05:09:17.906 --> 05:09:19.641
BLANK, FILL IN THE BLANK. ASK

05:09:19.707 --> 05:09:22.377
THE AIR DISTRICT. WE WILL SHUT

05:09:22.443 --> 05:09:24.679
DOWN OUR REFINERY IF WE NEED TO.

05:09:24.746 --> 05:09:26.781
WE CAN IMPORT MORE, EXPORT LESS,

05:09:26.848 --> 05:09:30.084
OR. OR BOTH. WE CAN ALSO

05:09:30.151 --> 05:09:31.719
INCREASE STORAGE. CALIFORNIA

05:09:31.786 --> 05:09:33.655
SET GOALS TO TRANSITION TO

05:09:33.721 --> 05:09:35.890
CLEAN ENERGY. WE'RE LEADERS. WE

05:09:35.957 --> 05:09:38.793
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD, NOT

05:09:38.860 --> 05:09:41.529
BACKWARDS. AND SO I DON'T KNOW

05:09:41.596 --> 05:09:44.032
WHAT 30 GALLONS A DAY IS GOING

05:09:44.098 --> 05:09:45.266
TO DO FOR US, BUT IT'S NOT

05:09:45.333 --> 05:09:50.271
GOING TO HELP. THANK YOU. MY

UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTOR, AND I

05:09:58.279 --> 05:10:00.114
STRONGLY OPPOSE ANY, ANY PLAN

05:10:00.181 --> 05:10:02.517
THAT INCLUDES MORE OIL DRILLING.

05:10:02.583 --> 05:10:05.753
AS THE YOUNG MAN IN FROM KERN

05:10:05.820 --> 05:10:08.890
COUNTY POINTED OUT, OIL

05:10:08.957 --> 05:10:09.757
PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA IS AMONG

05:10:09.824 --> 05:10:12.493
THE DIRTIEST AND MOST CLIMATE

05:10:12.560 --> 05:10:16.564
CHANGING IN THE WORLD, AND BIG

05:10:16.631 --> 05:10:18.733

05:10:18.800 --> 05:10:21.369
HAND, HOLD UNDUE POLITICAL

05:10:21.436 --> 05:10:22.737
POWER. AND THE HISTORICAL

05:10:22.804 --> 05:10:24.839
RECORD SHOWS THAT THEY WILL DO

05:10:24.906 --> 05:10:26.541
ANYTHING. THEY WILL STOP AT

05:10:26.607 --> 05:10:28.676
NOTHING TO CONTINUE TO REAP

05:10:28.743 --> 05:10:30.945
THEIR PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF

05:10:31.012 --> 05:10:32.613
THE SOCIAL GOOD. THEY HAVE DONE

05:10:32.680 --> 05:10:34.515
THIS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD,

05:10:34.582 --> 05:10:37.018
RUINING COMMUNITIES IN AFRICA,

05:10:37.085 --> 05:10:40.621
INDONESIA, USING ARMED GUARDS

05:10:40.688 --> 05:10:41.856
WHEN THEY DON'T GET THEIR WAY,

05:10:41.923 --> 05:10:43.524
AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO HOLD

05:10:43.591 --> 05:10:44.592
CALIFORNIA HOSTAGE BY

05:10:44.659 --> 05:10:45.760
THREATENING TO LEAVE. AND IT'S

05:10:45.827 --> 05:10:48.863
JUST RIDICULOUS. WE SHOULD BE.

05:10:48.930 --> 05:10:50.832
WE SHOULD NOT LET THEM SABOTAGE

05:10:50.898 --> 05:10:53.167
A GENUINE TRANSITION PLAN.

05:10:53.234 --> 05:10:55.703
THANK YOU. WE ARE ON THE PATH

05:10:55.770 --> 05:10:56.904
TOWARDS CALIFORNIA. HAS BEEN A

05:10:56.971 --> 05:10:58.639
LEADER IN THAT WE SHOULD NOT

05:10:58.706 --> 05:11:02.243
LET THEM SABOTAGE IT. THANK YOU.

05:11:02.310 --> 05:11:05.813
KATIE MCCAMMON 350 SACRAMENTO.

05:11:05.880 --> 05:11:07.615
I AM TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT

05:11:07.682 --> 05:11:09.751
THIS. TO BE HONEST, I LIVED 38

05:11:09.817 --> 05:11:11.586
YEARS OF MY LIFE IN A SMALL

05:11:11.652 --> 05:11:12.854
TOWN THAT SAW MORE AND MORE

05:11:12.920 --> 05:11:15.223
WILDFIRES. CLIMATE CHANGE IS

05:11:15.289 --> 05:11:15.757
SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY

05:11:15.823 --> 05:11:17.792
HURTING US, KILLING US. WE NEED

05:11:17.859 --> 05:11:20.194
YOU TO STAND UP AND BE A

05:11:20.261 --> 05:11:20.795
STRONGER LEGISLATURE, STRONGER

05:11:20.862 --> 05:11:22.730
POLITICIANS THAT STAND BY THE

05:11:22.797 --> 05:11:25.333
COMMUNITIES, NOT RICH, WEALTHY

05:11:25.400 --> 05:11:27.168
COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN

05:11:27.235 --> 05:11:29.103
SELLING US LIES. LIKE THEY SAID

05:11:29.170 --> 05:11:30.838
SINCE THE 1950S. WE KNOW YOU

05:11:30.905 --> 05:11:32.640
CAN DO BETTER. WE KNOW YOU WANT

05:11:32.707 --> 05:11:34.742
TO DO BETTER, AND WE KNOW THE

05:11:34.809 --> 05:11:37.145
TRUTH. YOU DON'T NEED THE

05:11:37.211 --> 05:11:37.745
SCIENCE. I DON'T NEED TO TELL

05:11:37.812 --> 05:11:40.081
YOU THE SCIENCE. WE ARE GOING

05:11:40.148 --> 05:11:41.249
TO SEE MORE DEATH ON OUR HANDS

05:11:41.315 --> 05:11:44.052
IF WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOSSIL

05:11:44.118 --> 05:11:45.486
FUEL COMPANIES TO EXPAND WHAT

05:11:45.553 --> 05:11:47.588
THEY'RE DOING. SEQUA IS OUR

05:11:47.655 --> 05:11:50.525
PROTECTION FOR THE PUBLIC. THIS

05:11:50.591 --> 05:11:53.027
ROLLBACK IS INSANE. DON'T DO IT.

05:11:53.094 --> 05:11:54.896
PROTECT US. DO NOT PROTECT

05:11:54.962 --> 05:11:59.934
WEALTHY PEOPLE. THANK YOU. ALL

05:12:00.001 --> 05:12:01.769
RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, CHAIR.

05:12:01.836 --> 05:12:02.937
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR STAMINA.

05:12:03.004 --> 05:12:04.639
MY NAME IS GARY HUGHES. I WORK

05:12:04.705 --> 05:12:06.040
WITH THE ORGANIZATION BIOFUEL

05:12:06.107 --> 05:12:07.842
WATCH, AND I'VE BEEN VERY

05:12:07.909 --> 05:12:09.043
ENGAGED ON THE CONVERSION OF

05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:10.678
THE REFINERIES IN THE SAN

05:12:10.745 --> 05:12:11.813
FRANCISCO BAY AREA TO MAKING

05:12:11.879 --> 05:12:13.081
DEFORESTATION, DRIVING LIQUID

05:12:13.147 --> 05:12:15.016
BIOFUELS. WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT

05:12:15.083 --> 05:12:16.651
OF A LIQUID BIOFUEL CARBON BOMB

05:12:16.717 --> 05:12:18.653
GOING OFF IN THE STATE FROM THE

05:12:18.719 --> 05:12:19.787
VERY BEGINNING. WE TRIED TO

05:12:19.854 --> 05:12:21.022
RAISE THE ALARMS ABOUT THE

05:12:21.089 --> 05:12:22.523
IMPACTS ON GASOLINE PRICES THAT

05:12:22.590 --> 05:12:23.825
THIS WOULD HAVE. BUT WHAT I

05:12:23.891 --> 05:12:26.027
WANT TO SAY IS SOMETHING THAT

05:12:26.094 --> 05:12:27.829
NO ONE ELSE HAS SAID. HERE IS

05:12:27.895 --> 05:12:28.830
THE IMPACTS ON FOOD PRICES,

05:12:28.896 --> 05:12:30.898
THAT MAKING LIQUID BIOFUELS

05:12:30.965 --> 05:12:33.000
FROM COMMODITIES LIKE SOY IS

05:12:33.067 --> 05:12:34.836
DRIVING GLOBAL FOOD PRICES UP.

05:12:34.902 --> 05:12:36.804
SO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

05:12:36.871 --> 05:12:37.772
AFFORDABILITY, YOU NEED TO

05:12:37.839 --> 05:12:39.841
CONTINUE TAKING A VERY CLOSE

05:12:39.907 --> 05:12:40.608
LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

05:12:40.675 --> 05:12:43.077
THE CONVERSION OF REFINERIES TO

05:12:43.144 --> 05:12:44.912
MAKING THESE HIGH EMISSIONS

05:12:44.979 --> 05:12:46.481
BIOFUELS. SO THANK YOU. THANK

05:12:46.547 --> 05:12:50.718
YOU. GOOD EVENING, CHAIR AND

05:12:50.785 --> 05:12:51.819
MEMBERS. I'LL KEEP THIS BRIEF.

05:12:51.886 --> 05:12:53.154
NATALIE BROWN WITH THE PLANNING

05:12:53.221 --> 05:12:54.555
AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE SHARING

05:12:54.622 --> 05:12:55.756
STRONG OPPOSITION TO CEQA

05:12:55.823 --> 05:12:56.691
EXEMPTIONS FOR NEW OIL WELL

05:12:56.757 --> 05:12:57.992
DRILLING, AND ECHOING THE

05:12:58.059 --> 05:12:59.494
COMMENTS OF OTHERS PREVIOUSLY

05:12:59.560 --> 05:13:01.028
ON THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU.

05:13:01.095 --> 05:13:04.699
THANK YOU. THANKS, CATHERINE

05:13:04.765 --> 05:13:06.400
VIERA. HOUSTON, UNITED

05:13:06.467 --> 05:13:07.535
STEELWORKERS DISTRICT 12 ON

05:13:07.602 --> 05:13:09.971
BEHALF OF OUR 30,000 WORKERS IN

05:13:10.037 --> 05:13:12.573
OIL. I WILL SAY THIS. THESE

05:13:12.640 --> 05:13:15.476
WORKERS EVERY DAY GO INTO THOSE

05:13:15.543 --> 05:13:16.677
REFINERIES AND THEY MAKE SURE

05:13:16.744 --> 05:13:18.713
THAT THEY DO IT SAFER THAN

05:13:18.779 --> 05:13:19.847
ANYBODY ELSE. FROM THE POINT

05:13:19.914 --> 05:13:21.616
THAT AB 32 FIRST CAME AROUND,

05:13:21.682 --> 05:13:22.817
WE WERE THE FIRST. YOU NEED TO

05:13:22.884 --> 05:13:25.219
GET ON BOARD WITH THAT BECAUSE

05:13:25.286 --> 05:13:26.087
WE RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF

05:13:26.154 --> 05:13:28.756
ENGAGING IN IT, BECAUSE WE ALSO

05:13:28.823 --> 05:13:30.858
SEE THAT IT ISN'T A SEPARATION.

05:13:30.925 --> 05:13:33.194
IT IS ABOUT WORKERS, IT IS

05:13:33.261 --> 05:13:34.495
ABOUT COMMUNITY, AND IT IS

05:13:34.562 --> 05:13:35.563
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT

05:13:35.630 --> 05:13:38.199
ALTOGETHER. AND SO IN THAT

05:13:38.266 --> 05:13:39.667
PROCESS, WHEN WE SAT THERE AND,

05:13:39.734 --> 05:13:40.968
YOU KNOW, MOST OF OUR WORKERS

05:13:41.035 --> 05:13:43.638
ARE IN CONTRA COSTA KERN AND

05:13:43.704 --> 05:13:45.873
LOS ANGELES, RIGHT. AND SO WHEN

05:13:45.940 --> 05:13:47.542
THOSE WORKERS, WHEN YOU HAD 350

05:13:47.608 --> 05:13:49.944
OF OUR WORKERS THAT LOST THEIR

05:13:50.011 --> 05:13:52.880
JOBS IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY TO,

05:13:52.947 --> 05:13:54.615
WHAT, THREE YEARS LATER, NOW

05:13:54.682 --> 05:13:55.850
THEY'RE STILL WE HAVE A LARGE

05:13:55.917 --> 05:13:57.118
PERCENTAGE OF THEM THAT STILL

05:13:57.185 --> 05:13:59.820
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND

05:13:59.887 --> 05:14:00.922
REEMPLOYMENT. WE HAD A MOM COME

05:14:00.988 --> 05:14:02.723
AND TESTIFY HERE, 31 YEARS OLD,

05:14:02.790 --> 05:14:04.792
PROVIDING AS A SINGLE MOM FOR

05:14:04.859 --> 05:14:07.228
HER THREE YEAR OLD AND HAD TO

05:14:07.295 --> 05:14:07.795
TAKE A JOB MAKING LESS THAN

05:14:07.862 --> 05:14:09.697
$30,000 A YEAR AND BENEFITED.

05:14:09.764 --> 05:14:11.566
SO WE SEE THAT THIS IS ALL OF

05:14:11.632 --> 05:14:13.501
US WORKING TOGETHER. WE

05:14:13.568 --> 05:14:14.835
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU

05:14:14.902 --> 05:14:16.504
ARE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:14:16.571 --> 05:14:19.340
THIS HAPPENS. THANK YOU. THANK

05:14:19.407 --> 05:14:22.743
YOU. HI, I'M DOCTOR WENDY

05:14:22.810 --> 05:14:24.111
BERNSTEIN, A LONGTIME RESIDENT

05:14:24.178 --> 05:14:25.680
OF ALBANY AND A COMMUNITY

05:14:25.746 --> 05:14:26.881
PSYCHIATRIST. THROUGHOUT MY

05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:28.983
CAREER, I'VE SEEN THE SUFFERING

05:14:29.050 --> 05:14:31.052
AND COST OF TREATING ILLNESSES

05:14:31.118 --> 05:14:32.887
LIKE DEPRESSION, ADHD, AND

05:14:32.954 --> 05:14:34.589
DEMENTIA IN PATIENTS LIVING IN

05:14:34.655 --> 05:14:36.357
FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES LIKE

05:14:36.424 --> 05:14:39.060
RICHMOND. ILLNESSES INCREASED

05:14:39.126 --> 05:14:41.028
BY EXPOSURE TO FOSSIL FUELS AND

05:14:41.095 --> 05:14:43.631
BY CLIMATE CHANGE. AS A MEMBER

05:14:43.698 --> 05:14:44.832
OF CLIMATE HEALTH NOW, I

05:14:44.899 --> 05:14:46.000
STRONGLY OPPOSE THE EXPANSION

05:14:46.067 --> 05:14:47.668
OF FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION IN

05:14:47.735 --> 05:14:51.272
LARGE AREAS OF CALIFORNIA.

05:14:51.339 --> 05:14:57.678
THANK YOU. OKAY. HOWDY. I AM

05:14:57.745 --> 05:14:59.614
KERRY GUERRERO FROM BERKELEY,

05:14:59.680 --> 05:15:03.384
AND CORPORATIONS WILL NOT

05:15:03.451 --> 05:15:05.319
ARBITRARILY LOWER PRICES AND

05:15:05.386 --> 05:15:07.755
HAVE TO REPORT BACK TO THEIR

05:15:07.822 --> 05:15:12.093
SHAREHOLDERS. SO GAS PRICES

05:15:12.159 --> 05:15:14.929
LOWERED WITH MORE DRILLING IS

05:15:14.996 --> 05:15:17.431
JUST ABSOLUTELY NOT HAPPENING.

05:15:17.498 --> 05:15:19.867
THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALWAYS WHERE

05:15:19.934 --> 05:15:22.236
THEY'RE HEADED. AND FOR MY

05:15:22.303 --> 05:15:25.172
FRIENDS WHO WORK IN INDUSTRIES

05:15:25.239 --> 05:15:28.542
THAT AYERS AND SEQUOIAS CREATE,

05:15:28.609 --> 05:15:30.811
WATCHING OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING,

05:15:30.878 --> 05:15:33.147
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

05:15:33.214 --> 05:15:34.749
PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY, THOSE

05:15:34.815 --> 05:15:36.017
PEOPLE ALSO LOSE THEIR JOBS.

05:15:36.083 --> 05:15:37.918
THEY ARE HUGE INDUSTRIES AND

05:15:37.985 --> 05:15:40.821
EMPLOY A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO

05:15:40.888 --> 05:15:43.891
SOMEONE WILL LOSE A JOB IF YOU

05:15:43.958 --> 05:15:45.660
GET RID OF SEQUA IN THE AIR. SO

05:15:45.726 --> 05:15:48.829
PLEASE, PLEASE PROTECT THOSE

05:15:48.896 --> 05:15:51.432
PEOPLE ALSO. THANK YOU. THANK

05:15:51.499 --> 05:15:54.735
YOU. GOOD EVENING. I SUPPOSE IT

05:15:54.802 --> 05:15:58.239
IS NOW, WOODY LITTLE WITH THE

05:15:58.306 --> 05:15:59.940
LAST CHANCE ALLIANCE. I WANTED

05:16:00.007 --> 05:16:00.875
TO REITERATE THE CONCERNS

05:16:00.941 --> 05:16:02.743
VICTORIA ROME RAISED AROUND THE

05:16:02.810 --> 05:16:05.746
AB 1167 CHANGES FOR BONDING. IT

05:16:05.813 --> 05:16:07.948
HASN'T BEEN AS MUCH OF A TOPIC

05:16:08.015 --> 05:16:08.949
OF CONVERSATION, BUT IT IS A

05:16:09.016 --> 05:16:10.751
REAL, REAL CONCERN FOR A LOT OF

05:16:10.818 --> 05:16:11.919
OUR GROUPS WHO ARE HERE TODAY

05:16:11.986 --> 05:16:14.355
RESPONDING TO A FEW OF THE

05:16:14.422 --> 05:16:15.222
CHAIR'S COMMENTS. SINCE YOU'RE

05:16:15.289 --> 05:16:16.557
ONE OF THE ONLY ONES LEFT, IT'S

05:16:16.624 --> 05:16:18.092
A GOOD QUESTION AROUND THE

05:16:18.159 --> 05:16:19.760
DEMAND REDUCTION ASSUMPTIONS. I

05:16:19.827 --> 05:16:21.662
BELIEVE PART OF HOW THAT BAR

05:16:21.729 --> 05:16:23.964
GRAPH GETS SO MUCH SHORTER IS

05:16:24.031 --> 05:16:25.733
THAT ELECTRICAL TRAVEL IS

05:16:25.800 --> 05:16:26.867
INHERENTLY MORE EFFICIENT,

05:16:26.934 --> 05:16:28.769
RIGHT? SO DRIVING AROUND ON AN

05:16:28.836 --> 05:16:29.603
INTERMITTENT EXPLOSION IS NOT A

05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:31.639
TERRIBLY EFFICIENT WAY TO GET

05:16:31.706 --> 05:16:32.807
AROUND IN TERMS OF ENERGY

05:16:32.873 --> 05:16:33.674
EXPENDED PER MILE. SO I WOULD

05:16:33.741 --> 05:16:35.509
DEFER TO CARB STAFF FOLLOWING

05:16:35.576 --> 05:16:36.844
UP. BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S PART

05:16:36.911 --> 05:16:38.646
OF WHAT MAKES THAT A MORE

05:16:38.713 --> 05:16:39.647
REASONABLE ASSUMPTION. I ALSO

05:16:39.714 --> 05:16:41.682
APPRECIATED YOUR NOTE THAT HOPE

05:16:41.749 --> 05:16:42.950
IS NOT A STRATEGY. FROM OUR

05:16:43.017 --> 05:16:44.485
PERSPECTIVE, THE GOVERNOR'S

05:16:44.552 --> 05:16:45.853
DRILLING PROPOSAL IS A LOT OF

05:16:45.920 --> 05:16:47.455
HOPE AND NOT A WHOLE LOT OF

05:16:47.521 --> 05:16:48.823
STRATEGY. WE'VE SEEN THAT THAT

05:16:48.889 --> 05:16:50.958
SHORT LINE STARTS AT 2021, BUT

05:16:51.025 --> 05:16:52.893
WE SHOULD LOOK BACK TO 1985,

05:16:52.960 --> 05:16:54.829
RIGHT? WE'VE BEEN ON A 40 YEAR

05:16:54.895 --> 05:16:56.897
DECLINE. AS OTHER FOLKS HAVE

05:16:56.964 --> 05:16:58.499
SAID, WE'RE GOING TO HOLD

05:16:58.566 --> 05:17:00.034
STABLE FOR TEN YEARS. IT'S NOT

05:17:00.101 --> 05:17:03.337
REALISTIC. THANKS. THANK YOU.

05:17:03.404 --> 05:17:05.573
GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR

05:17:05.639 --> 05:17:07.808
HOLDING FIRM. I'M NORMAN ROGERS.

05:17:07.875 --> 05:17:10.544
I'M WITH US, LOCAL 675. WE'RE

05:17:10.611 --> 05:17:11.712
LOCATED DOWN IN SOUTHERN

05:17:11.779 --> 05:17:13.714
CALIFORNIA AND OUR LOCAL WE

05:17:13.781 --> 05:17:15.583
HAVE REFINERIES, WE HAVE

05:17:15.649 --> 05:17:16.717
EXTRACTION WORKERS, WE HAVE

05:17:16.784 --> 05:17:18.486
PIPELINE WORKERS, AND WE HAVE

05:17:18.552 --> 05:17:20.654
LOGISTICS WORKERS. ONE THING

05:17:20.721 --> 05:17:23.157
THAT I WOULD MENTION IS THE

05:17:23.224 --> 05:17:25.059
DIFFERENTIATION IS MADE BETWEEN

05:17:25.126 --> 05:17:27.094
WORKERS AND THE COMMUNITY. FOR

05:17:27.161 --> 05:17:28.429
US. YOU CAN LIVE IN CARSON AND

05:17:28.496 --> 05:17:29.864
WORK AT A REFINERY IN TORRANCE.

05:17:29.930 --> 05:17:32.166
YOU CAN LIVE IN TORRANCE AND

05:17:32.233 --> 05:17:34.135
WORK IN A REFINERY IN CARSON.

05:17:34.201 --> 05:17:35.202
OUR WORKERS ARE THE COMMUNITY,

05:17:35.269 --> 05:17:37.405
SO I NEED TO LET THAT BE KNOWN.

05:17:37.471 --> 05:17:38.739
AND THEN ALSO THAT WE'VE HAD

05:17:38.806 --> 05:17:40.808
CONTRACTS IN PLACE FOR ALMOST

05:17:40.875 --> 05:17:42.710
100 YEARS NOW. THAT'S 100 YEARS

05:17:42.777 --> 05:17:44.678
OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. SO

05:17:44.745 --> 05:17:46.614
OUR WAGES AND OUR BENEFITS HAVE

05:17:46.680 --> 05:17:48.682
GOTTEN TO A VERY GOOD PLACE

05:17:48.749 --> 05:17:50.851
WITH THAT, THERE'S A LARGE

05:17:50.918 --> 05:17:51.652
DEGREE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AMONGST

05:17:51.719 --> 05:17:53.821
OUR RANK AND FILE. SO WITH THE

05:17:53.888 --> 05:17:55.856
REFINERY GOING AWAY, OUR

05:17:55.923 --> 05:17:56.624
WORKERS LOSING THEIR JOBS, THE

05:17:56.690 --> 05:17:59.093
NEXT THING THAT STARTS TO

05:17:59.160 --> 05:18:00.027
SPIRAL DOWN ARE THE REVENUES

05:18:00.094 --> 05:18:02.930
FOR MUNICIPALITIES. AND THEN

05:18:02.997 --> 05:18:03.964
THAT ENDS UP IMPACTING OUR

05:18:04.031 --> 05:18:06.033
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES, FIREMEN,

05:18:06.100 --> 05:18:09.103
POLICE, OUR POLICEMEN AND AND

05:18:09.170 --> 05:18:10.738
TEACHERS. SO IT'S NOT WHAT WE

05:18:10.805 --> 05:18:12.740
DO NEXT, IT'S HOW WE GO ABOUT

05:18:12.807 --> 05:18:14.742
IT. THE ONE OTHER THING I WOULD

05:18:14.809 --> 05:18:15.976
MENTION IS WHEN COMPANIES TALK

05:18:16.043 --> 05:18:17.778
ABOUT THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OR

05:18:17.845 --> 05:18:18.579
WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE,

05:18:18.646 --> 05:18:19.847
THEY'RE SITTING ON THEIR MONEY

05:18:19.914 --> 05:18:21.816
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

05:18:21.882 --> 05:18:23.617
DO NEXT. AND THAT MEANS IMPACTS

05:18:23.684 --> 05:18:26.153
TO SPENDING MONEY ON THE SAFETY

05:18:26.220 --> 05:18:28.255
AND THE HEALTH OF THE

05:18:28.322 --> 05:18:29.356
FACILITIES. THANK YOU, THANK

05:18:29.423 --> 05:18:34.428
YOU. HELLO PAUL SMITH I LIVE IN

05:18:34.495 --> 05:18:39.099
OAKLAND. SO LEGISLATORS KNOW

05:18:39.166 --> 05:18:41.902
THE DAMAGE PETROLEUM HAS DONE

05:18:41.969 --> 05:18:43.771
TO OUR PLANET. I'M PERSONALLY

05:18:43.838 --> 05:18:44.939
TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT ICE

05:18:45.005 --> 05:18:47.741
SHELVES THE SIZE OF CONNECTICUT

05:18:47.808 --> 05:18:50.010
BREAKING OFF OF OUR ANTARCTICA.

05:18:50.077 --> 05:18:52.746
BECAUSE OF THIS INDUSTRY. WE

05:18:52.813 --> 05:18:55.149
SHOULDN'T BE HELPING THEM OUT.

05:18:55.216 --> 05:18:57.318
WE SHOULD BE MAKING THEM

05:18:57.384 --> 05:19:00.855
SMALLER. AND THANKS A LOT.

05:19:00.921 --> 05:19:04.024

DIVERSITY, THE ADMINISTRATION'S

05:19:08.896 --> 05:19:11.098
DRILLING PROPOSAL RELIES ON THE

05:19:11.165 --> 05:19:12.466
FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT WAIVING

05:19:12.533 --> 05:19:14.768
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND RUBBER

05:19:14.835 --> 05:19:16.837
STAMPING THOUSANDS OF NEW

05:19:16.904 --> 05:19:18.105
DRILLING PERMITS WILL INCREASE

05:19:18.172 --> 05:19:20.207
OVERALL CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION IN

05:19:20.274 --> 05:19:23.777

ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

05:19:36.724 --> 05:19:38.759
COMPLETELY IGNORES THIS DATA.

05:19:38.826 --> 05:19:41.729

WELLS ARE GOING TO PRODUCE 30

05:19:43.864 --> 05:19:46.600
BARRELS OF OIL A DAY WHEN THE

AVERAGE OIL WELL PRODUCES LESS

05:19:48.536 --> 05:19:52.106
THAN FIVE BARRELS PER DAY, IS

05:19:52.172 --> 05:19:54.241
ANOTHER FAULTY ASSUMPTION.

05:19:54.308 --> 05:19:56.277
GREENLIGHTING NEW WELLS WITH

05:19:56.343 --> 05:19:58.579
FEWER SAFEGUARDS WILL ONLY DO

05:19:58.646 --> 05:20:01.482
MORE HARM AND WILL NOT SOLVE

05:20:01.549 --> 05:20:03.617

RECOGNIZE THAT THE CLIMATE

05:25:11.191 --> 05:25:13.961
CRISIS IS HERE NOW AND URGENT.

05:25:14.027 --> 05:25:15.829
CALIFORNIA HAS INCREDIBLY

05:25:15.896 --> 05:25:17.497
AMBITIOUS AND INCREDIBLY

05:25:17.564 --> 05:25:18.699
IMPORTANT CLIMATE GOALS, BUT

05:25:18.765 --> 05:25:20.734
IMPORTANT IS NOT THE SAME AS

05:25:20.801 --> 05:25:22.736
EASY. AND WE ALSO HAVE A
