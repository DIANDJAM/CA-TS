THAT SERVE THEM. AND I'M VERY

03:27:44.218 --> 03:27:46.120
HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PROVIDE A

03:27:46.187 --> 03:27:48.255
OVERVIEW OF WHAT STATES ARE

03:27:48.322 --> 03:27:50.157
DOING WITH RESPECT TO STATE

03:27:50.224 --> 03:27:51.792
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. AND I

03:27:51.859 --> 03:27:54.261

MYSELF TO HEAR SOME UPDATES ON

03:28:01.001 --> 03:28:03.137
WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN SOME OF

03:28:03.204 --> 03:28:05.172
THE STATES. SO WITHOUT FURTHER

03:28:05.239 --> 03:28:07.107
ADO, LET'S GET GOING. SO LET'S

03:28:07.174 --> 03:28:09.343
SEE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE WANT TO

03:28:09.410 --> 03:28:11.979
GIVE JUST A LITTLE FOUNDATIONAL

03:28:12.046 --> 03:28:14.181
INFORMATION ON WHY WE'RE HERE

03:28:14.248 --> 03:28:16.884
REAL QUICK. SO. THERE'S YOU

03:28:16.951 --> 03:28:18.719
KNOW I DON'T WANT TO SAY

03:28:18.786 --> 03:28:20.120
THERE'S A TRANSPORTATION

03:28:20.187 --> 03:28:22.122
FUNDING CRISIS. BUT WE ARE IN A

03:28:22.189 --> 03:28:25.326
SITUATION WHERE THE TRADITIONAL

03:28:25.392 --> 03:28:26.293
FORMS OF REVENUE THAT STATES

03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:28.462
ARE RELIANT ON ARE BEGINNING TO

03:28:28.529 --> 03:28:30.231
DECLINE, PARTICULARLY GAS, THE

03:28:30.297 --> 03:28:32.066
GAS TAX. AND AS YOU CAN SEE

03:28:32.132 --> 03:28:33.968
FROM THIS SLIDE FROM THE

03:28:34.034 --> 03:28:35.169
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE

03:28:35.236 --> 03:28:37.004
BUDGET OFFICERS, THE MOST

03:28:37.071 --> 03:28:39.106
IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT IN

03:28:39.173 --> 03:28:40.808
THIS SLIDE IS THE TOP LINE, THE

03:28:40.875 --> 03:28:43.277
BLUE LINE. YOU'LL SEE THAT IN

03:28:43.344 --> 03:28:45.846
2016. THAT STATE TRANSFER THE

03:28:45.913 --> 03:28:49.817
GAS TAX COMPRISED 41.1% OF

03:28:49.884 --> 03:28:50.985
STATE TRANSPORTATION REVENUE.

03:28:51.051 --> 03:28:53.187
YOU FAST FORWARD JUST EIGHT

03:28:53.254 --> 03:28:54.755
YEARS LATER AND THAT HAS

03:28:54.822 --> 03:28:57.691
ALREADY DECLINED ALMOST 6%,

03:28:57.758 --> 03:29:00.461
DOWN TO 35.9%. AND THAT, OF

03:29:00.527 --> 03:29:02.496
COURSE, IS BECAUSE OF THE

03:29:02.563 --> 03:29:03.864
INCREASING PREVALENCE OF

03:29:03.931 --> 03:29:05.232
ELECTRIC AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE

03:29:05.299 --> 03:29:07.268
FUEL VEHICLES, BUT ALSO JUST

03:29:07.334 --> 03:29:11.472
THE INCREASED EFFICIENCY OF THE

03:29:11.538 --> 03:29:12.339
VEHICLE FLEET OVERALL. NEXT

03:29:12.406 --> 03:29:15.175
SLIDE PLEASE. AND THIS SLIDE

03:29:15.242 --> 03:29:16.944
JUST KIND OF SHOWS SPECIFIC TO

03:29:17.011 --> 03:29:18.112
ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE

03:29:18.178 --> 03:29:20.281
DEPENDENT ON SOME DIFFERENT

03:29:20.347 --> 03:29:23.250
ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION KIND

03:29:23.317 --> 03:29:25.886
OF FORECASTING THAT YOU'LL SEE

03:29:25.953 --> 03:29:28.255
ESSENTIALLY THAT YELLOW LINE AT

03:29:28.322 --> 03:29:30.190
THE TOP LINE IS WHAT WE WOULD

03:29:30.257 --> 03:29:33.193
EXPECT TO STATES TO COLLECT IN

03:29:33.260 --> 03:29:36.196
FUEL TAX WITHOUT NÓ WITH

03:29:36.263 --> 03:29:37.431
WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN THE

03:29:37.498 --> 03:29:39.233
CURRENT MILEAGE PER GALLON OF

03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:41.435
THE NATIONAL FLEET. AND THEN

03:29:41.502 --> 03:29:43.170
DEPENDING ON THESE DIFFERENT

03:29:43.237 --> 03:29:44.038
PROJECTIONS AND YOU CAN SEE THE

03:29:44.104 --> 03:29:46.240
GAP GETS LARGER AND LARGER AND

03:29:46.307 --> 03:29:49.977
LARGER EVERY, EVERY FIVE YEARS,

03:29:50.044 --> 03:29:51.445
YOU KNOW, KIND OF POINTING THAT

03:29:51.512 --> 03:29:52.913
THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO, YOU

03:29:52.980 --> 03:29:54.148
KNOW, LIKELY GET WORSE AND

03:29:54.214 --> 03:29:55.983
WORSE OVER TIME. NEXT SLIDE

03:29:56.050 --> 03:29:58.018
PLEASE. AND OF COURSE, THIS IS

03:29:58.085 --> 03:29:59.186
ALSO IMPACTED BY THE FACT THAT

03:29:59.253 --> 03:30:01.188
THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE GAS

03:30:01.255 --> 03:30:02.456
TAX IN THIS SLIDE IS SPECIFIC

03:30:02.523 --> 03:30:04.258
TO THE FEDERAL GAS TAX HAS JUST

03:30:04.325 --> 03:30:06.226
FALLEN. IT JUST BECAUSE OF

03:30:06.293 --> 03:30:08.162
INFLATION AND FUEL EFFICIENCY

03:30:08.228 --> 03:30:12.866
GAINS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO I

03:30:12.933 --> 03:30:14.234
JUST WANT TO GIVE A QUICK

03:30:14.301 --> 03:30:15.402
OVERVIEW REALLY WHAT MY JOB

03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:17.271
HERE TO DO IS JUST TO GIVE YOU

03:30:17.338 --> 03:30:19.239
A QUICK SENSE OF WHAT OTHER

03:30:19.306 --> 03:30:20.007
STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE DONE

03:30:20.074 --> 03:30:22.376
WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION

03:30:22.443 --> 03:30:23.277
FUNDING, MOSTLY FOCUSING ON

03:30:23.344 --> 03:30:25.512
USER FEES. BUT WE'LL STOP.

03:30:25.579 --> 03:30:26.213
START WITH THE OBVIOUS GAS

03:30:26.280 --> 03:30:28.315
TAXES. SINCE 2013, 35 STATES

03:30:28.382 --> 03:30:30.651
AND DC HAVE INCREASED THEIR GAS

03:30:30.718 --> 03:30:32.953
TAX. THERE ARE NOW ALMOST HALF

03:30:33.020 --> 03:30:34.989
OF THE STATES THAT HAVE INDEXED

03:30:35.055 --> 03:30:36.256
OR VARIABLE RATE GAS TAXES,

03:30:36.323 --> 03:30:38.592
MEANING THAT IN SOME WAY THEY

03:30:38.659 --> 03:30:40.160
TRACK WITH POPULATION GROWTH OR

03:30:40.227 --> 03:30:42.262
INFLATION, WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT

03:30:42.329 --> 03:30:44.064
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS A A TREND

03:30:44.131 --> 03:30:46.467
TOWARDS FEWER STATES

03:30:46.533 --> 03:30:47.067
CONSIDERING GAS TAXES, BECAUSE

03:30:47.134 --> 03:30:49.069
THEY DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S

03:30:49.136 --> 03:30:51.538
THAT IS A AS, AS EVIDENCE. AND

03:30:51.605 --> 03:30:52.506
THAT THE FIRST SLIDE I SHOWED

03:30:52.573 --> 03:30:54.274
KIND OF A DECREASING SOURCE OF

03:30:54.341 --> 03:30:57.044
REVENUE IN GENERAL AND MORE OF

03:30:57.111 --> 03:30:59.179
AN EMPHASIS ON TRYING TO

03:30:59.246 --> 03:31:02.116
GENERATE REVENUE FROM USERS VIA

03:31:02.182 --> 03:31:04.218
DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. NEXT

03:31:04.284 --> 03:31:08.455
SLIDE PLEASE. THIS IS WHAT I

03:31:08.522 --> 03:31:09.056
CALL THE KIND OF POTPOURRI OR

03:31:09.123 --> 03:31:11.191
KIND OF JUST THROW ALL OPTIONS

03:31:11.258 --> 03:31:13.927
AT THE WALL SLIDE. THIS SHOWS

03:31:13.994 --> 03:31:16.163
YOU JUST SOME OF THE MANY, MANY

03:31:16.230 --> 03:31:17.931
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT STATES FUND

03:31:17.998 --> 03:31:19.099
THEIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.

03:31:19.166 --> 03:31:21.201
AND SOME OF THESE ARE PRETTY

03:31:21.268 --> 03:31:22.069
UNUSUAL. A COUPLE THAT I WOULD

03:31:22.136 --> 03:31:24.405
POINT OUT ARE LIKE HOTEL

03:31:24.471 --> 03:31:27.541
REVENUE. GEORGIA HAS CREATED A

03:31:27.608 --> 03:31:31.211
A TAX, A FEE ON HOTEL STAYS AND

03:31:31.278 --> 03:31:33.013
DEDICATED SOME OF THAT MONEY TO

03:31:33.080 --> 03:31:34.214
TRANSPORTATION. SOME STATES USE

03:31:34.281 --> 03:31:36.283
OIL AND SEVERANCE TAXES, SOME

03:31:36.350 --> 03:31:38.152
STATES USE SALES TAXES. SOME

03:31:38.218 --> 03:31:39.953
STATES USE SOME OF THEIR

03:31:40.020 --> 03:31:41.055
LOTTERY FEES. SO THIS IS JUST

03:31:41.121 --> 03:31:43.123
SOMETHING THAT I FIND SOMETIMES

03:31:43.190 --> 03:31:44.258
GENERATES SOME IDEAS FOR FOR

03:31:44.324 --> 03:31:45.893
DIFFERENT STATES. SO I INCLUDE

03:31:45.959 --> 03:31:48.195
FOR THAT PURPOSES FOR THOSE

03:31:48.262 --> 03:31:51.432
PURPOSES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO

03:31:51.498 --> 03:31:53.233
THE MOST COMMON APPROACH THAT

03:31:53.300 --> 03:31:55.569
STATES HAVE TAKEN IF THEY'VE

03:31:55.636 --> 03:31:58.605
CREATED FLAT REGISTRATION FEES

03:31:58.672 --> 03:32:01.008
ON THE REGISTRATION OF

03:32:01.075 --> 03:32:03.243
ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES AND

03:32:03.310 --> 03:32:07.815

TRADITIONAL HYBRIDS. AND WHAT

03:32:09.116 --> 03:32:10.217
YOU'LL SEE NOW IS THAT 41

03:32:10.284 --> 03:32:11.885
STATES HAVE THESE ANNUAL

03:32:11.952 --> 03:32:14.221
ELECTRIC VEHICLE REGISTRATION

03:32:14.288 --> 03:32:16.156
FEES. THESE ARE ON TOP OF THE

03:32:16.223 --> 03:32:17.991
TRADITIONAL REGISTRATION FEES.

03:32:18.058 --> 03:32:19.326
AND THESE FEES RANGE QUITE A

03:32:19.393 --> 03:32:22.262
BIT FROM $50 IN COLORADO,

03:32:22.329 --> 03:32:24.665
HAWAII AND SOUTH DAKOTA, UP TO

03:32:24.731 --> 03:32:27.067
AROUND $290 IN NEW JERSEY BY

03:32:27.134 --> 03:32:29.269
2028. YOU ALSO SEE THAT 34

03:32:29.336 --> 03:32:30.971
STATES HAVE PLUG IN OR

03:32:31.038 --> 03:32:32.072
NON-PLUG-IN HYBRID FEES. THAT'S

03:32:32.139 --> 03:32:33.874
A TREND THAT WE'VE REALLY SEEN

03:32:33.941 --> 03:32:37.111
OF LATE. AND SOME STATES, I

03:32:37.177 --> 03:32:38.345
BELIEVE THERE ARE SIX, HAVE

03:32:38.412 --> 03:32:40.647
STARTED TO INDEX SOME OF THESE

03:32:40.714 --> 03:32:41.248
FEES SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO

03:32:41.315 --> 03:32:43.283
BACK AND RAISE THEM AGAIN JUST

03:32:43.350 --> 03:32:44.184
TO CREATE SOME SORT OF INDEXING

03:32:44.251 --> 03:32:46.086
PROVISION THAT THEY RAISE WITH

03:32:46.153 --> 03:32:49.256
INFLATION OR 5 TO $10 PER YEAR.

03:32:49.323 --> 03:32:53.060
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND CAN YOU

03:32:53.127 --> 03:32:55.195
CLICK ONE MORE TIME. AND THIS

03:32:55.262 --> 03:32:56.797
SHOULD POPULATE SOME SOME INFO

03:32:56.864 --> 03:33:00.100
IN THE SLIDE. YEAH. SO OUR

03:33:00.167 --> 03:33:04.438
SPEAKERS FROM HAWAII, HAWAII

03:33:04.505 --> 03:33:05.873
VIRGINIA OREGON AND UTAH WILL

03:33:05.939 --> 03:33:07.207
SPEAK TO THIS MORE COMPLETELY.

03:33:07.274 --> 03:33:09.076
SO I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS,

03:33:09.143 --> 03:33:11.378
BUT ESSENTIALLY ROAD USER OR

03:33:11.445 --> 03:33:13.113
ROAD USAGE CHARGES, ALSO KNOWN

03:33:13.180 --> 03:33:14.648
AS MILEAGE BASED USER FEES OR

03:33:14.715 --> 03:33:16.316
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED FEES

03:33:16.383 --> 03:33:18.318
HAVE BEEN QUITE THE DISCUSSION

03:33:18.385 --> 03:33:19.820
OF LATE. AND OF COURSE, THERE'S

03:33:19.887 --> 03:33:21.021
BEEN A LOT OF PILOTING AND

03:33:21.088 --> 03:33:22.289
STUDYING OF THAT IN CALIFORNIA.

03:33:22.356 --> 03:33:23.957
LED BY LAUREN PREHODA, THERE

03:33:24.024 --> 03:33:26.160
ARE FOUR STATES THAT CURRENTLY

03:33:26.226 --> 03:33:27.628
OPERATE VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS

03:33:27.694 --> 03:33:28.862
OREGON, UTAH, VIRGINIA AND

03:33:28.929 --> 03:33:30.230
HAWAII. I THINK THE IMPORTANT

03:33:30.297 --> 03:33:32.933
THING TO KNOW IS THOSE ALL WERE

03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:34.301
CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND

03:33:34.368 --> 03:33:35.135
THE AND THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES,

03:33:35.202 --> 03:33:38.205
AND THEY ARE ALL VOLUNTARY AT

03:33:38.272 --> 03:33:39.206
THE AT THIS TIME. NEXT SLIDE

03:33:39.273 --> 03:33:44.611
PLEASE. CLICK TWO MORE. YEAH.

03:33:44.678 --> 03:33:46.246
ONE MORE TIME. THERE WE GO. AND

03:33:46.313 --> 03:33:49.016
SO THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE

03:33:49.082 --> 03:33:50.884
THREE KIND OF OLDER PROGRAMS.

03:33:50.951 --> 03:33:52.085
HAWAII'S PROGRAM JUST STARTED

03:33:52.152 --> 03:33:54.688
IN 2025. AND YOU'LL LEARN MORE

03:33:54.755 --> 03:33:55.856
ABOUT THAT IN A BIT. JUST NOTE

03:33:55.923 --> 03:33:57.991
THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

03:33:58.058 --> 03:33:59.159
NECESSARILY ENROLLEES IN ALL

03:33:59.226 --> 03:33:59.993
THESE PROGRAMS, ALTHOUGH YOU'LL

03:34:00.060 --> 03:34:01.228
NOTICE THAT VIRGINIA AND UTAH

03:34:01.295 --> 03:34:03.363
HAVE QUITE A FEW MORE ENROLLEES.

03:34:03.430 --> 03:34:05.632
VIRGINIA, THE WAY THAT THEY

03:34:05.699 --> 03:34:07.067
HAVE CONSTRUCTED THEIR PROGRAM

03:34:07.134 --> 03:34:09.203
LEADS IT TO JUST HAVING MORE

03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:10.070
ENROLLEES IN GENERAL. AND I DO

03:34:10.137 --> 03:34:12.005
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WORTH

03:34:12.072 --> 03:34:13.407
CONSIDERING FOR CALIFORNIA AND

03:34:13.473 --> 03:34:16.310
OTHER STATES. THE THE RATE OF

03:34:16.376 --> 03:34:18.946
THE MILEAGE RATE IS FAIRLY

03:34:19.012 --> 03:34:25.052
SIMILAR. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I

03:34:25.118 --> 03:34:26.486
JUST WANT TO MENTION QUICKLY IN

03:34:26.553 --> 03:34:28.222
HAWAII THAT, YOU KNOW, HAWAII

03:34:28.288 --> 03:34:30.123
IS A RUCK PROGRAM JUST STARTED

03:34:30.190 --> 03:34:31.925
ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO.

03:34:31.992 --> 03:34:34.161
THE ONE THING I WANT TO NOTE IS

03:34:34.228 --> 03:34:36.897
THAT WHEN IN 2028, THE RUCK

03:34:36.964 --> 03:34:38.232
PROGRAM WILL BECOME MANDATORY

03:34:38.298 --> 03:34:39.299
FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE OWNERS,

03:34:39.366 --> 03:34:40.934
AND IT WILL THUS BECOME THE

03:34:41.001 --> 03:34:44.238
FIRST MANDATORY RUCK PROGRAM

03:34:44.304 --> 03:34:46.039
FOR A CERTAIN CLASS OF VEHICLE

03:34:46.106 --> 03:34:49.509
OWNERS IN THE COUNTRY. I WON'T

03:34:49.576 --> 03:34:51.211
GO INTO THAT ANYMORE. NEXT

03:34:51.278 --> 03:34:55.148
SLIDE. AND WITH VIRGINIA, THE

03:34:55.215 --> 03:34:57.150
MAIN THING THAT I WOULD KNOW IS

03:34:57.217 --> 03:34:58.885
THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ELIGIBLE

03:34:58.952 --> 03:35:00.187
VEHICLES THAT FUEL EFFICIENT

03:35:00.254 --> 03:35:02.189
VEHICLES, THOSE AND THEY DEFINE

03:35:02.256 --> 03:35:04.024
THOSE AS THOSE GETTING 25 MILES

03:35:04.091 --> 03:35:06.126
PER GALLON OR OVER OR ALSO

03:35:06.193 --> 03:35:07.361
INCLUDED IN THIS, I THINK THIS

03:35:07.427 --> 03:35:08.996
IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN,

03:35:09.062 --> 03:35:11.098
THE DECLINE IN THE GAS TAX IS

03:35:11.164 --> 03:35:12.899
NOT JUST CAUSED BY THE

03:35:12.966 --> 03:35:15.102
PROLIFERATION OF ALTERNATIVE

03:35:15.168 --> 03:35:16.303
FUEL VEHICLES, ESPECIALLY

03:35:16.370 --> 03:35:17.404
ELECTRIC VEHICLES, ARGUABLY

03:35:17.471 --> 03:35:19.139
MORE IN THE SHORT TERM. IT'S

03:35:19.206 --> 03:35:21.508
BEING CAUSED BY FUEL EFFICIENT

03:35:21.575 --> 03:35:25.912
VEHICLES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO

03:35:25.979 --> 03:35:27.981
A COUPLE I'M GOING TO QUICKLY

03:35:28.048 --> 03:35:29.316
GO OVER SOME OF THE OTHER USER

03:35:29.383 --> 03:35:30.984
FEES THAT STATES HAVE LOOKED AT.

03:35:31.051 --> 03:35:32.286
SO ONE HAS BEEN TRANSPORTATION

03:35:32.352 --> 03:35:33.086
NETWORK COMPANY FEES,

03:35:33.153 --> 03:35:34.121
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

03:35:34.187 --> 03:35:35.455
COMPANIES OR UBER AND LYFT AND

03:35:35.522 --> 03:35:37.024
OTHER RIDE HAILING SERVICES.

03:35:37.090 --> 03:35:38.358
YOU'LL NOTE HERE THAT THERE'S

03:35:38.425 --> 03:35:40.494
ABOUT, I WANT TO SAY, 12 STATES

03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:42.095
THAT HAVE THESE TNC FEES IN

03:35:42.162 --> 03:35:43.263
PLACE. MANY OF THEM ARE

03:35:43.330 --> 03:35:44.031
ACTUALLY JUST FOR

03:35:44.097 --> 03:35:47.100
ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES AND TO

03:35:47.167 --> 03:35:49.002
KIND OF DO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT

03:35:49.069 --> 03:35:52.239
OF THE TNC DRIVER SAFETY

03:35:52.306 --> 03:35:55.042
BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEMS. BUT

03:35:55.108 --> 03:35:56.243
YOU'LL NOTICE THERE ARE STATES

03:35:56.310 --> 03:35:58.078
SUCH AS CALIFORNIA, COLORADO,

03:35:58.145 --> 03:36:00.347
NEW YORK, MASSACHUSETTS,

03:36:00.414 --> 03:36:01.848
GEORGIA THAT HAVE DEDICATED

03:36:01.915 --> 03:36:03.483
SOME OF THESE FEES FOR

03:36:03.550 --> 03:36:05.419
TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES.

03:36:05.485 --> 03:36:06.920
NOTABLY, GEORGIA AND NEW YORK

03:36:06.987 --> 03:36:08.221
ARE DEDICATING ALMOST THE

03:36:08.288 --> 03:36:10.657
TOTALITY OF THEIR FEE REVENUE

03:36:10.724 --> 03:36:13.093
TO TRANSIT. AND THESE FEES KIND

03:36:13.160 --> 03:36:17.097
OF VARY QUITE WIDELY. THEY VARY

03:36:17.164 --> 03:36:20.300
FROM ABOUT 5 TO $0.50 PER RIDE.

03:36:20.367 --> 03:36:24.671
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. DELIVERY

03:36:24.738 --> 03:36:26.173
FEES. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I

03:36:26.239 --> 03:36:28.275
SPOKE WITH SOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER,

03:36:28.342 --> 03:36:29.910
WILSON AT OUR LEGISLATIVE

03:36:29.976 --> 03:36:32.112
SUMMIT A FEW WEEKS AGO IN

03:36:32.179 --> 03:36:33.447
BOSTON. THERE ARE JUST TWO

03:36:33.513 --> 03:36:35.115
STATES THAT HAVE PUT IN PLACE

03:36:35.182 --> 03:36:37.851
DELIVERY FEES COLORADO BACK IN

03:36:37.918 --> 03:36:41.054
2021 AND THEN MINNESOTA IN 2023.

03:36:41.121 --> 03:36:42.756
THERE ARE A FEW OTHER STATES

03:36:42.823 --> 03:36:43.957
THAT HAVE CONSIDERED AND

03:36:44.024 --> 03:36:45.258
DEBATED SUCH BILLS, BUT THESE

03:36:45.325 --> 03:36:47.327
ARE ONLY TWO STATES THAT ENACT

03:36:47.394 --> 03:36:48.195
THEM THUS FAR. YOU'LL NOTICE

03:36:48.261 --> 03:36:49.196
THAT THE WAY THEY'RE

03:36:49.262 --> 03:36:50.664
CONSTRUCTED IS QUITE A BIT

03:36:50.731 --> 03:36:53.600
DIFFERENT. COLORADO'S FEE IS IS

03:36:53.667 --> 03:36:55.535
LOWER. IT'S $0.27, BUT IT

03:36:55.602 --> 03:36:56.903
APPLIES TO ANY DELIVERY,

03:36:56.970 --> 03:36:59.172
MEANING YOU GET A $1 PACKAGE OR

03:36:59.239 --> 03:37:01.274
YOU GET A DOORDASH DELIVERY.

03:37:01.341 --> 03:37:02.476
AND CRITICALLY, THESE THE

03:37:02.542 --> 03:37:04.845
COLORADO FEE DOES APPLY TO MEAL

03:37:04.911 --> 03:37:07.848
DELIVERY, WHEREAS MINNESOTA'S

03:37:07.914 --> 03:37:09.282
IS $0.50 FOR EACH RETAIL

03:37:09.349 --> 03:37:11.084
DELIVERY PURCHASE, BUT THE ONLY

03:37:11.151 --> 03:37:13.320
KICKS IN AT $100. AND

03:37:13.387 --> 03:37:16.623
CRITICALLY, THEY EXEMPTED SOME

03:37:16.690 --> 03:37:19.025
MEDICAL CHILD PRODUCTS AND ALSO

03:37:19.092 --> 03:37:21.428
FOOD INGREDIENTS. SO QUITE A

03:37:21.495 --> 03:37:22.963
BIT OF DIFFERENCE THERE. BUT

03:37:23.029 --> 03:37:24.030
THEY'RE BOTH EXPECTED OR HAVE

03:37:24.097 --> 03:37:25.665
GENERATED A GOOD AMOUNT OF

03:37:25.732 --> 03:37:27.300
REVENUE. YOU CAN SEE IN THE

03:37:27.367 --> 03:37:28.135
FIRST YEAR THAT COLORADO

03:37:28.201 --> 03:37:30.837
COLLECTED THIS FEE, COLLECTED

03:37:30.904 --> 03:37:31.972
ALMOST $76 MILLION IN FEES,

03:37:32.038 --> 03:37:35.075
WHICH IS MOSTLY DEDICATED TO

03:37:35.142 --> 03:37:36.276
TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. NEXT

03:37:36.343 --> 03:37:40.847
SLIDE PLEASE. ANOTHER USER FEE

03:37:40.914 --> 03:37:42.215
APPROACH THAT STATES HAVE TAKEN

03:37:42.282 --> 03:37:45.185
WITHIN A PARTICULAR EYE TOWARDS.

03:37:45.252 --> 03:37:47.320
WELL, WITH A SPECIFIC EYE

03:37:47.387 --> 03:37:48.488
TOWARDS ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS

03:37:48.555 --> 03:37:50.357
KILOWATT PER HOUR CHARGES, ALSO

03:37:50.424 --> 03:37:51.892
KNOWN AS ELECTRIC VEHICLE

03:37:51.958 --> 03:37:53.326
CHARGING STATION FEES. THERE

03:37:53.393 --> 03:37:54.961
ARE NOW TEN STATES THAT HAVE

03:37:55.028 --> 03:37:58.231
THESE FEES. AND THESE FEES ONLY

03:37:58.298 --> 03:38:01.001
APPLY AT PUBLIC EV CHARGING

03:38:01.067 --> 03:38:03.136
STATIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE TO

03:38:03.203 --> 03:38:05.005
COLLECT THESE FEES FROM PRIVATE

03:38:05.071 --> 03:38:07.541
RESIDENCES, BUT THERE IS SOME

03:38:07.607 --> 03:38:09.109
MORE TECHNOLOGY AND COMPLIANCE

03:38:09.176 --> 03:38:10.377
KIND OF ISSUES RELATED WITH

03:38:10.444 --> 03:38:12.179
THAT. SO IT'S CERTAINLY

03:38:12.245 --> 03:38:13.013
TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE, BUT A

03:38:13.079 --> 03:38:15.148
LITTLE BIT MORE TRICKY FROM AN

03:38:15.215 --> 03:38:17.918
ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSE. THIS IS

03:38:17.984 --> 03:38:20.520
SOMETHING THAT I THINK STATES

03:38:20.587 --> 03:38:22.289
FIND ATTRACTIVE, BECAUSE IF YOU

03:38:22.355 --> 03:38:24.090
THINK OF A STATE THAT WAS

03:38:24.157 --> 03:38:26.326
PREVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE

03:38:26.393 --> 03:38:27.160
SOMEONE IN ARIZONA AND THEY'RE

03:38:27.227 --> 03:38:28.361
DRIVING TO OREGON AND THEY'RE

03:38:28.428 --> 03:38:30.163
DOING THAT VIA VIA CALIFORNIA.

03:38:30.230 --> 03:38:31.998
AND THEY USED TO HAVE AN ICE

03:38:32.065 --> 03:38:34.167
VEHICLE, AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION

03:38:34.234 --> 03:38:36.570
ENGINE VEHICLE. WILL THEY WOULD,

03:38:36.636 --> 03:38:38.472
YOU KNOW, PROBABLY STOP AT

03:38:38.538 --> 03:38:39.239
LEAST A COUPLE TIMES IN

03:38:39.306 --> 03:38:40.106
CALIFORNIA AND PAY A GAS TAX.

03:38:40.173 --> 03:38:42.108
WELL, NOW, IF THEY HAVE AN

03:38:42.175 --> 03:38:43.243
ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND THEY'RE

03:38:43.310 --> 03:38:44.010
JUST RECHARGING THE STATE,

03:38:44.077 --> 03:38:45.145
THEY'RE NOT PAYING ANYTHING. SO

03:38:45.212 --> 03:38:47.180
THIS IS A PARTICULARLY A WAY TO

03:38:47.247 --> 03:38:49.282
TRY AND CAPTURE REVENUE FROM

03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:50.517
USERS SUCH AS THAT. BUT LIKE I

03:38:50.584 --> 03:38:52.719
SAID, THE THE THE ONE DOWNSIDE

03:38:52.786 --> 03:38:54.020
I THINK PARTICULARLY TO THIS IS

03:38:54.087 --> 03:38:56.056
THAT THOSE THAT HAVE THE

03:38:56.122 --> 03:38:57.324
ABILITY AND THE, THE, THE

03:38:57.390 --> 03:39:00.060
PRIVILEGE TO CHARGE AT HOME ARE

03:39:00.126 --> 03:39:01.895
NOT BEING CHARGED THIS FEE,

03:39:01.962 --> 03:39:03.697
ALTHOUGH LIKE I SAID,

03:39:03.763 --> 03:39:04.664
TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE BUT A

03:39:04.731 --> 03:39:07.033
LITTLE BIT TRICKIER. NEXT SLIDE

03:39:07.100 --> 03:39:11.104
PLEASE. THE LAST TREND IS

03:39:11.171 --> 03:39:12.305
STATES WITH MANAGED LANES.

03:39:12.372 --> 03:39:13.974
MANAGED LANES ARE ALSO KNOWN AS

03:39:14.040 --> 03:39:15.275
EXPRESS TOLL LANES, CHOICE

03:39:15.342 --> 03:39:16.510
LANES, ETC. AND CALIFORNIA IS

03:39:16.576 --> 03:39:19.179
ONE OF, I BELIEVE 11 STATES

03:39:19.246 --> 03:39:20.647
THAT NOW HAVE THOSE. THERE'S

03:39:20.714 --> 03:39:22.382
BEEN A PROLIFERATION OF THESE

03:39:22.449 --> 03:39:24.184
LANES. CRITICALLY MANAGED LANES

03:39:24.251 --> 03:39:25.919
HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS OF A

03:39:25.986 --> 03:39:27.087
POLITICAL BAR TO CLEAR, BECAUSE

03:39:27.153 --> 03:39:30.257
MANAGED LANES ARE WHERE ONE OR

03:39:30.323 --> 03:39:33.660
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LANES ARE

03:39:33.727 --> 03:39:34.961
ARE TOLLED, WHEREAS THE OTHER

03:39:35.028 --> 03:39:37.564
LANES ARE STILL FREE. SO YOU

03:39:37.631 --> 03:39:39.332
HAVE A CHOICE TO USE THESE

03:39:39.399 --> 03:39:41.134
LANES. AND THE THESE MANAGED

03:39:41.201 --> 03:39:43.036
LANES SERVE TWO PURPOSES. THEY

03:39:43.103 --> 03:39:45.305
MANAGE CONGESTION IN CONGESTED

03:39:45.372 --> 03:39:46.206
METRO AREAS, AND THEY ALSO

03:39:46.273 --> 03:39:48.708
GENERATE REVENUE. THAT REVENUE

03:39:48.775 --> 03:39:51.411
CAN BE USED IN THAT CORRIDOR OR

03:39:51.478 --> 03:39:52.746
ELSEWHERE. ANOTHER ASSOCIATED

03:39:52.812 --> 03:39:54.614
BENEFIT IS THAT PUBLIC TRANSIT

03:39:54.681 --> 03:39:57.183
VEHICLES, BUSSES, SPECIFICALLY

03:39:57.250 --> 03:39:58.051
BUS RAPID TRANSIT, CAN USE

03:39:58.118 --> 03:40:00.620
THESE MANAGED LANES AND THAT

03:40:00.687 --> 03:40:04.124
TYPICALLY INCREASES THEIR SPEED

03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:06.192
AND FREQUENCY, WHICH LEADS TO

03:40:06.259 --> 03:40:08.361
INCREASED RIDERSHIP AND ALSO TO

03:40:08.428 --> 03:40:09.129
INCREASE FARE REVENUE. SO

03:40:09.195 --> 03:40:10.964
THERE'S A LOT OF KIND OF

03:40:11.031 --> 03:40:13.300
CO-BENEFITS WITH MANAGED LANES.

03:40:13.366 --> 03:40:16.970
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND THIS IS

03:40:17.037 --> 03:40:18.672
JUST AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF OUR

03:40:18.738 --> 03:40:19.506
MAIN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING

03:40:19.573 --> 03:40:21.007
RESOURCES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE

03:40:21.074 --> 03:40:22.275
BEEN UPDATED JUST IN THE LAST

03:40:22.342 --> 03:40:25.378
WEEK OR SO. AND THEN MY CONTACT

03:40:25.445 --> 03:40:26.079
INFORMATION IS ON THE NEXT

03:40:26.146 --> 03:40:28.214
SLIDE. AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I

03:40:28.281 --> 03:40:29.950
HAVE. AND I WILL TRY AND HANG

03:40:30.016 --> 03:40:31.318
ON UNTIL THE END IN CASE THERE

03:40:31.384 --> 03:40:32.852
ARE ANY QUESTIONS. AND THANK

03:40:32.919 --> 03:40:34.955
YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME.

03:40:35.021 --> 03:40:36.056
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILSON AND

03:40:36.122 --> 03:40:37.991
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, THANK

03:40:38.058 --> 03:40:42.896
YOU SO MUCH, DOCTOR JIN. ALL

03:40:42.963 --> 03:40:45.832
RIGHT. AND I ALSO HAVE A COUPLE

03:40:45.899 --> 03:40:47.033
SLIDES. HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE

03:40:47.100 --> 03:40:50.136
BRINGING THOSE UP. YEAH. AND I

03:40:50.203 --> 03:40:51.938
WANTED TO TO THANK DOUG FOR

03:40:52.005 --> 03:40:53.373
THIS PRESENTATION. IT'S A

03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:54.274
REALLY GOOD SORT OF FOUNDATION

03:40:54.341 --> 03:40:55.875
FOR SOME OF THE MATERIAL THAT

03:40:55.942 --> 03:40:57.110
I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT. SO HE

03:40:57.177 --> 03:40:59.546
INTRODUCED A BUNCH OF THESE

03:40:59.613 --> 03:41:01.615
DIFFERENT FEE STRUCTURES AND

03:41:01.681 --> 03:41:03.216
FEE MECHANISMS. AND WHAT I WANT

03:41:03.283 --> 03:41:06.353
TO DO IS TAKE A STEP BACK AND

03:41:06.419 --> 03:41:07.087
THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE

03:41:07.153 --> 03:41:09.389
METRICS THAT WE USE TO JUDGE

03:41:09.456 --> 03:41:11.057
WHETHER OR NOT THESE FEE

03:41:11.124 --> 03:41:12.225
MECHANISMS ARE ARE GOOD OR BAD.

03:41:12.292 --> 03:41:14.928
RIGHT. AND SO I'VE PUT TOGETHER

03:41:14.995 --> 03:41:17.497
HOPEFULLY A KIND OF SIMPLER SET

03:41:17.564 --> 03:41:19.332
OF SLIDES THAT WILL KIND OF

03:41:19.399 --> 03:41:21.067
WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE

03:41:21.134 --> 03:41:22.268
MECHANISM, SOME OF THE MORE

03:41:22.335 --> 03:41:23.903
POPULAR ONES THAT FOLKS ARE

03:41:23.970 --> 03:41:26.473
TALKING ABOUT, SO THAT WE CAN

03:41:26.539 --> 03:41:29.643
THINK ABOUT THAT. YEAH. ALL

03:41:29.709 --> 03:41:32.545
RIGHT. SO IF WE GO ON TO THE

03:41:32.612 --> 03:41:35.281
NEXT SLIDE. YEAH. AND SO THE

03:41:35.348 --> 03:41:36.916
MAIN THING, RIGHT, THAT WE'RE

03:41:36.983 --> 03:41:39.185
THE SORT OF MEAT OF IT IS

03:41:39.252 --> 03:41:40.854
THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:42.155
REVENUE CAN ACTUALLY MEET YOUR

03:41:42.222 --> 03:41:44.457
FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. SO THE

03:41:44.524 --> 03:41:45.692
FIRST ONE WE'RE KIND OF OUR

03:41:45.759 --> 03:41:48.028
BASELINE IS THE GAS TAX. RIGHT.

03:41:48.094 --> 03:41:49.696
AND SO YOU'VE HEARD FROM

03:41:49.763 --> 03:41:53.133
SPEAKER TODAY. AND AS I TAKE IT

03:41:53.199 --> 03:41:55.068
EARLIER ON IN OUR PREVIOUS

03:41:55.135 --> 03:41:57.103
SESSION ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH

03:41:57.170 --> 03:41:58.405
THE GAS TAX. RIGHT. AND SO I'M

03:41:58.471 --> 03:42:00.407
NOT GOING TO BELABOR THIS, BUT

03:42:00.473 --> 03:42:01.241
WHAT I'LL JUST MENTION THE

03:42:01.307 --> 03:42:03.209
THREE MAIN THINGS INFLATION,

03:42:03.276 --> 03:42:05.011
FUEL EFFICIENCY AND THEN

03:42:05.078 --> 03:42:06.212
ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLE GROWTH.

03:42:06.279 --> 03:42:09.349
SO ELECTRIC VEHICLES MAINLY I

03:42:09.416 --> 03:42:11.151
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE KIND OF

03:42:11.217 --> 03:42:13.253
GRASP ONTO THE EV PART OF IT.

03:42:13.319 --> 03:42:14.154
BUT ACTUALLY THE OTHER TWO TEND

03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:16.022
TO BE KIND OF THE BIGGER THING,

03:42:16.089 --> 03:42:19.059
AT LEAST FOR NOW, IMPACTING

03:42:19.125 --> 03:42:21.127
REVENUE COMING FROM GAS TAXES.

03:42:21.194 --> 03:42:22.962
THE OTHER REALLY POPULAR ONE

03:42:23.029 --> 03:42:25.298
THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING, WE

03:42:25.365 --> 03:42:27.600
JUST HEARD IN THE PREVIOUS

03:42:27.667 --> 03:42:29.169
PRESENTATION, REGISTRATION FEES.

03:42:29.235 --> 03:42:30.437
RIGHT. AND SO MANY, MANY STATES

03:42:30.503 --> 03:42:33.073
ARE DOING THIS. AND IT'S IT'S

03:42:33.139 --> 03:42:34.941
RELATIVELY EASY TO IMPLEMENT.

03:42:35.008 --> 03:42:37.210
BUT ONE KEY THING TO KEEP IN

03:42:37.277 --> 03:42:39.212
MIND IS SO SUPPOSE IN

03:42:39.279 --> 03:42:40.213
CALIFORNIA EVERYONE WERE

03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:42.082
DRIVING ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

03:42:42.148 --> 03:42:43.883
WE PAID FOR OUR FUNDING,

03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:45.085
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THROUGH

03:42:45.151 --> 03:42:47.120
REGISTRATION FEES. WITH THE

03:42:47.187 --> 03:42:48.888
CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT'S SET UP,

03:42:48.955 --> 03:42:51.091
WE WOULD BE IN A TERRIBLE

03:42:51.157 --> 03:42:53.226
DEFICIT. RIGHT? SO THERE IS NOT

03:42:53.293 --> 03:42:54.260
THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION WITH

03:42:54.327 --> 03:42:56.196
THE WAY THE REGISTRATION FEES

03:42:56.262 --> 03:42:57.997
ARE CURRENTLY STRUCTURED AND

03:42:58.064 --> 03:43:00.166
WITH THE ACTUAL FUNDING NEEDS

03:43:00.233 --> 03:43:02.202
OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

03:43:02.268 --> 03:43:04.704
SO THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE TO KEEP.

03:43:04.771 --> 03:43:06.339
KEEP IN MIND, THE OTHER ONE

03:43:06.406 --> 03:43:08.108
THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT IS THE

03:43:08.174 --> 03:43:10.643
ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLE FUEL TAX.

03:43:10.710 --> 03:43:11.177
SO THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE

03:43:11.244 --> 03:43:13.179
DOLLAR PER KILOWATT HOUR CHARGE

03:43:13.246 --> 03:43:15.181
THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE

03:43:15.248 --> 03:43:17.183
PREVIOUS PRESENTATION. AND SO

03:43:17.250 --> 03:43:19.185
THIS WOULD BE KIND OF THE

03:43:19.252 --> 03:43:20.053
EQUIVALENT OF IF YOU DROVE AN

03:43:20.120 --> 03:43:22.055
ELECTRIC VEHICLE, YOU WOULD BE

03:43:22.122 --> 03:43:23.356
PAYING A GAS TAX EQUIVALENT.

03:43:23.423 --> 03:43:24.124
RIGHT. EVERY TIME YOU CHARGE

03:43:24.190 --> 03:43:26.159
YOUR VEHICLE YOU'D PAY A LITTLE

03:43:26.226 --> 03:43:28.394
BIT. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:43:28.461 --> 03:43:30.997
THIS WOULD SOLVE THAT FIRST

03:43:31.064 --> 03:43:33.066
ISSUE, YOU DO SOLVE THIS ISSUE

03:43:33.133 --> 03:43:36.035
OF MISSING THE REVENUE FROM

03:43:36.102 --> 03:43:37.303
ELECTRIC VEHICLES, BUT YOU'D

03:43:37.370 --> 03:43:39.172
STILL RUN INTO ISSUES RELATED

03:43:39.239 --> 03:43:42.942
TO FUEL EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS.

03:43:43.009 --> 03:43:45.278
AND SO THAT CAN CONTINUE TO BE

03:43:45.345 --> 03:43:46.880
A PROBLEM. ROAD USAGE CHARGES.

03:43:46.946 --> 03:43:49.215
SO THIS IS SORT OF LONGER TERM

03:43:49.282 --> 03:43:51.351
SOLUTION. I THINK IT ADDRESSES

03:43:51.417 --> 03:43:53.153
THE SORT OF NEATLY ADDRESSES

03:43:53.219 --> 03:43:55.121
THE THREE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

03:43:55.188 --> 03:43:56.089
TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE FACING

03:43:56.156 --> 03:43:59.125
THE GAS TAX. AND SO IN THIS

03:43:59.192 --> 03:43:59.959
PARTICULAR CATEGORY KIND OF

03:44:00.026 --> 03:44:02.061
RATE IT AS VERY GOOD. SO THE

03:44:02.128 --> 03:44:04.130
COLOR SCHEME RED IS KIND OF

03:44:04.197 --> 03:44:05.365
REALLY BAD. AND GREEN IS KIND

03:44:05.431 --> 03:44:07.233
OF THE BEST POSSIBLE SOLUTION

03:44:07.300 --> 03:44:09.269
OKAY. AND SO MOVING ON. SO

03:44:09.335 --> 03:44:12.038
THAT'S TALKING SPECIFICALLY

03:44:12.105 --> 03:44:14.941
ABOUT REVENUE REQUIREMENTS. AND

03:44:15.008 --> 03:44:17.343
SO WHAT ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION.

03:44:17.410 --> 03:44:18.945
SO THIS IS THINKING ABOUT THE

03:44:19.012 --> 03:44:20.180
EASE OF IMPLEMENTATION BUT ALSO

03:44:20.246 --> 03:44:22.315
THE COSTS. SO THE GOLD STANDARD

03:44:22.382 --> 03:44:23.983
IS THE GAS TAX. IT IS THE

03:44:24.050 --> 03:44:25.752
EASIEST AND CHEAPEST THING THAT

03:44:25.819 --> 03:44:27.253
YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO. AND THE

03:44:27.320 --> 03:44:30.256
REASON FOR THIS IS THE WAY THAT

03:44:30.323 --> 03:44:31.958
WE COLLECT GAS TAXES IS

03:44:32.025 --> 03:44:34.060
ACTUALLY AT WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE

03:44:34.127 --> 03:44:35.562
BULK STORAGE TERMINAL. SO

03:44:35.628 --> 03:44:37.030
THAT'S WHERE GASOLINE SITS

03:44:37.096 --> 03:44:39.199
RIGHT BEFORE IT GOES OFF TO A

03:44:39.265 --> 03:44:40.867
GAS STATION. AND IN CALIFORNIA

03:44:40.934 --> 03:44:43.069
THERE'S ABOUT 30 OF THEM. RIGHT.

03:44:43.136 --> 03:44:45.238
AND SO THE TAX MAN GETS TO GO

03:44:45.305 --> 03:44:46.105
AROUND AND COLLECT TAXES FROM

03:44:46.172 --> 03:44:48.842
30 PEOPLE. NOW AS SOON AS YOU

03:44:48.908 --> 03:44:50.944
START CHARGING BASED ON

03:44:51.010 --> 03:44:52.212
INDIVIDUAL VEHICLES, NOW YOU'RE

03:44:52.278 --> 03:44:53.413
TALKING ABOUT INSTEAD OF

03:44:53.479 --> 03:44:54.948
COLLECTING TAXES FROM 30 PEOPLE,

03:44:55.014 --> 03:44:56.316
YOU ARE NOW COLLECTING TAXES

03:44:56.382 --> 03:44:58.218
FROM 30 TO 40 MILLION, RIGHT?

03:44:58.284 --> 03:45:00.987
THAT'S HOW MANY CARS WE HAVE IN

03:45:01.054 --> 03:45:02.288
CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S LITERALLY A

03:45:02.355 --> 03:45:03.957
MILLION TIMES HARDER TO DO. SO

03:45:04.023 --> 03:45:07.760
FOR BASICALLY ALL OF THE OTHER

03:45:07.827 --> 03:45:08.928
ALTERNATIVES, MOST OTHER

03:45:08.995 --> 03:45:11.798
ALTERNATIVES, I SHOULD SAY THE

03:45:11.865 --> 03:45:14.300
COST OF IMPLEMENTATION IS TOUGH.

03:45:14.367 --> 03:45:16.502
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

03:45:16.569 --> 03:45:17.937
REGISTRATION FEES OKAY. THIS

03:45:18.004 --> 03:45:20.206
ONE IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MORE

03:45:20.273 --> 03:45:21.274
COMPELLING REASONS WHY WE'VE

03:45:21.341 --> 03:45:23.476
SEEN IT BECOME POPULAR. IN SOME

03:45:23.543 --> 03:45:25.411
STATES, YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING

03:45:25.478 --> 03:45:27.013
FOR REGISTRATION FEES. AND SO

03:45:27.080 --> 03:45:29.182
TO ADD THAT ON AS AN EXTRA FEE

03:45:29.249 --> 03:45:30.483
FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE

03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:31.484
STANDPOINT TENDS TO BE A LITTLE

03:45:31.551 --> 03:45:35.989
BIT EASIER. THE FUEL TAX, THE

03:45:36.055 --> 03:45:38.191
DOLLAR PER KILOWATT HOUR. SO IT

03:45:38.258 --> 03:45:41.060
WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE

03:45:41.127 --> 03:45:43.429
TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

03:45:43.496 --> 03:45:46.366
DIFFICULTIES FROM A

03:45:46.432 --> 03:45:47.066
IMPLEMENTATION STANDPOINT.

03:45:47.133 --> 03:45:48.301
ACTUALLY THERE ARE IT'S

03:45:48.368 --> 03:45:49.969
ACTUALLY VERY COSTLY. THE

03:45:50.036 --> 03:45:52.772
PROBLEM IS WITH ELECTRICITY,

03:45:52.839 --> 03:45:53.973
RIGHT. WE DON'T JUST USE

03:45:54.040 --> 03:45:55.141
ELECTRICITY FOR CARS. RIGHT.

03:45:55.208 --> 03:45:56.342
WE'RE POWERING OUR LIGHTS AND

03:45:56.409 --> 03:45:58.978
OUR TVS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.

03:45:59.045 --> 03:46:01.447
AND SO TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY

03:46:01.514 --> 03:46:02.815
MEASURE AND SEPARATE THE

03:46:02.882 --> 03:46:04.250
ELECTRICITY USE IN CARS, YOU'D

03:46:04.317 --> 03:46:08.288
NEED ESSENTIALLY A ANOTHER

03:46:08.354 --> 03:46:10.256
METER SEPARATE FOR YOUR VEHICLE

03:46:10.323 --> 03:46:11.057
OR OTHER SORT OF HARDWARE

03:46:11.124 --> 03:46:13.393
EQUIPMENT THAT COULD DO THAT

03:46:13.459 --> 03:46:14.761
MEASUREMENT. AND THAT'S

03:46:14.827 --> 03:46:15.261
EXPENSIVE UNFORTUNATELY.

03:46:15.328 --> 03:46:17.096
IMAGINE HAVING TO HAVE THAT

03:46:17.163 --> 03:46:18.364
EQUIPMENT FOR BASICALLY EVERY

03:46:18.431 --> 03:46:21.000
CAR OUT THERE, NOT TO MENTION

03:46:21.067 --> 03:46:22.168
ISSUES WITH GAMING THE SYSTEM.

03:46:22.235 --> 03:46:24.470
MAYBE SOMEONE PLUGS INTO A

03:46:24.537 --> 03:46:27.073
DIFFERENT OUTLET, RIGHT? AND SO

03:46:27.140 --> 03:46:29.275
FROM AN IMPLEMENTATION

03:46:29.342 --> 03:46:30.076
STANDPOINT, I THINK THIS ONE IS

03:46:30.143 --> 03:46:33.546
PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. ROAD

03:46:33.613 --> 03:46:36.049
USAGE CHARGES. THERE ARE COSTS

03:46:36.115 --> 03:46:37.283
ASSOCIATED WITH THE HARDWARE

03:46:37.350 --> 03:46:40.053
COSTS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.

03:46:40.119 --> 03:46:42.255
THERE ARE THERE'S A LOT OF

03:46:42.322 --> 03:46:43.089
MOVEMENT IN THE PILOTS THAT

03:46:43.156 --> 03:46:45.058
EXIST TO TRY AND THINK ABOUT

03:46:45.124 --> 03:46:46.893
SOLUTIONS TO HELP BRING DOWN

03:46:46.960 --> 03:46:47.994
THE COSTS. AND THOSE

03:46:48.061 --> 03:46:50.129
PROJECTIONS, I THINK, ARE

03:46:50.196 --> 03:46:51.064
PROMISING. BUT I DON'T THINK

03:46:51.130 --> 03:46:53.366
YOU'LL EVER GET TO A POINT

03:46:53.433 --> 03:46:54.367
WHERE IT'S GOING TO REALLY BE

03:46:54.434 --> 03:46:56.669
AS CHEAP AS THE GAS TAX, AND

03:46:56.736 --> 03:46:57.770
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE JUST

03:46:57.837 --> 03:46:59.238
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AND AS

03:46:59.305 --> 03:47:00.974
WE PURSUE SOMETHING LIKE A ROAD

03:47:01.040 --> 03:47:02.275
USAGE CHARGE, THAT'S SOMETHING

03:47:02.342 --> 03:47:04.177
THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE KEPT IN

03:47:04.243 --> 03:47:05.111
MIND, THAT YOU'RE NEVER REALLY

03:47:05.178 --> 03:47:08.481
GOING TO GET TO AS CHEAP AS WE

03:47:08.548 --> 03:47:09.549
WERE BEFORE IN TERMS OF

03:47:09.615 --> 03:47:10.316
IMPLEMENTING IMPLEMENTATION.

03:47:10.383 --> 03:47:16.055
OKAY. NEXT ONE. OKAY. SO THIS

03:47:16.122 --> 03:47:17.256
IS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:47:17.323 --> 03:47:19.292
THEORETICAL, BUT THERE IS A

03:47:19.359 --> 03:47:22.495
FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN. WHEN WE

03:47:22.562 --> 03:47:23.997
INITIALLY STARTED USING A GAS

03:47:24.063 --> 03:47:26.199
TAX, WHICH IS YOU PAY FOR THE

03:47:26.265 --> 03:47:28.034
ROADS BASED OFF OF HOW MUCH YOU

03:47:28.101 --> 03:47:30.136
USE IT. RIGHT. SO SOMEONE WHO

03:47:30.203 --> 03:47:32.238
DRIVES 10,000 MILES IS GOING TO

03:47:32.305 --> 03:47:34.007
PAY LESS THAN SOMEONE WHO

03:47:34.073 --> 03:47:36.209
DRIVES 20,000 MILES. WE START

03:47:36.275 --> 03:47:37.043
TO DEPART FROM THAT A LITTLE

03:47:37.110 --> 03:47:39.278
BIT FROM A FUEL WHEN THE FUEL

03:47:39.345 --> 03:47:41.180
ECONOMIES ARE DIFFERENT. RIGHT.

03:47:41.247 --> 03:47:42.682
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:47:42.749 --> 03:47:45.818
REASONS WHY EFFICIENCY STARTS

03:47:45.885 --> 03:47:48.187
TO DEPART FROM THIS KIND OF

03:47:48.254 --> 03:47:50.223
PRINCIPLE. REGISTRATION FEES,

03:47:50.289 --> 03:47:53.159
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, TOTALLY

03:47:53.226 --> 03:47:53.960
DECOUPLED FROM THE AMOUNT THAT

03:47:54.027 --> 03:47:55.995
YOU DRIVE, RIGHT? SO I COULD

03:47:56.062 --> 03:47:57.330
PARK MY CAR IN MY GARAGE THE

03:47:57.397 --> 03:47:58.931
ENTIRE YEAR, DRIVE ZERO MILES,

03:47:58.998 --> 03:48:01.300
AND I WOULD PAY THE EXACT SAME

03:48:01.367 --> 03:48:02.268
AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR FOR

03:48:02.335 --> 03:48:03.936
REGISTRATION. AS SOMEONE WHO

03:48:04.003 --> 03:48:06.139
DROVE 10,000 MILES A YEAR. AND

03:48:06.205 --> 03:48:08.241
SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE,

03:48:08.307 --> 03:48:10.209
REGISTRATION FEE IS IS KIND OF

03:48:10.276 --> 03:48:12.945
A REALLY POOR MECHANISM. I WILL

03:48:13.012 --> 03:48:14.614
KIND OF REALLY QUICKLY MENTION

03:48:14.680 --> 03:48:16.349
THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS USER PAY

03:48:16.416 --> 03:48:18.985
PRINCIPLE. IT IT'S NOT

03:48:19.052 --> 03:48:20.520
NECESSARILY THE THE SORT OF

03:48:20.586 --> 03:48:21.921
CORRECT WAY, YOU KNOW, THERE

03:48:21.988 --> 03:48:23.156
ARE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PAY

03:48:23.222 --> 03:48:25.358
FROM A GENERAL FUND, RIGHT. BUT

03:48:25.425 --> 03:48:27.627
IN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY,

03:48:27.693 --> 03:48:29.228
THE WAY THAT WE'VE THOUGHT

03:48:29.295 --> 03:48:32.065
ABOUT MAKING THIS EQUITABLE IS

03:48:32.131 --> 03:48:34.634
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:48:34.700 --> 03:48:37.070
PAYING BASED OFF OF HOW MUCH

03:48:37.136 --> 03:48:39.939
THEY'RE USING. SO YOU HAVE A

03:48:40.006 --> 03:48:42.141
SAME ISSUE WITH THE ZEV FUEL

03:48:42.208 --> 03:48:43.976
TAX AS YOU DO WITH A GAS TAX,

03:48:44.043 --> 03:48:46.479
WITH THE ROAD USAGE CHARGE. YOU

03:48:46.546 --> 03:48:48.347
DON'T YOU DON'T SUFFER FROM

03:48:48.414 --> 03:48:50.516
THIS IDEA THAT MORE EFFICIENT

03:48:50.583 --> 03:48:52.618
VEHICLES WILL PAY KIND OF LESS

03:48:52.685 --> 03:48:53.152
OF THEIR SHARE. EVERYONE'S

03:48:53.219 --> 03:48:55.154
ESSENTIALLY PAYING THE SAME

03:48:55.221 --> 03:48:56.355
AMOUNT PER MILE. THAT'S THAT'S

03:48:56.422 --> 03:48:58.057
DRIVEN. AND SO FROM THIS KIND

03:48:58.124 --> 03:49:00.259
OF PRINCIPLE THAT WE ORIGINALLY

03:49:00.326 --> 03:49:02.462
DESIGNED OUR FUNDING MECHANISMS

03:49:02.528 --> 03:49:05.231
TO, TO BE BASED ON, THIS IS

03:49:05.298 --> 03:49:07.433
KIND OF THE BEST THAT YOU COULD

03:49:07.500 --> 03:49:11.003
DO. OKAY. AND I THINK THERE'S

03:49:11.070 --> 03:49:15.241
ONE MORE. WE GO NEXT. YEAH. THE

03:49:15.308 --> 03:49:18.177
WHAT IS THE EQUITABLE NATURE OF

03:49:18.244 --> 03:49:20.580
THE PRICING MECHANISM. AND SO

03:49:20.646 --> 03:49:22.448
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT EQUITY AS

03:49:22.515 --> 03:49:24.851
IT PERTAINS TO PAYING FOR YOUR

03:49:24.917 --> 03:49:27.053
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, IT

03:49:27.120 --> 03:49:28.855
BALANCES THIS USER PAYS

03:49:28.921 --> 03:49:30.490
PRINCIPLE THAT I WAS JUST

03:49:30.556 --> 03:49:32.592
TALKING ABOUT, BUT ALSO THINKS

03:49:32.658 --> 03:49:33.459
ABOUT INCOME SENSITIVITY AND

03:49:33.526 --> 03:49:36.095
THE ACTUAL ABILITY TO PAY. SO

03:49:36.162 --> 03:49:38.030
IF WE THINK ABOUT GAS TAXES AS

03:49:38.097 --> 03:49:41.834
KIND OF THE BASELINE HERE, THIS

03:49:41.901 --> 03:49:43.970
IS RELATIVELY NEUTRAL FROM A

03:49:44.036 --> 03:49:45.238
USAGE PERSPECTIVE. IT'S NOT

03:49:45.304 --> 03:49:47.807
CORRELATED WITH INCOME

03:49:47.874 --> 03:49:52.578
NECESSARILY, BUT IT IS. IT DOES

03:49:52.645 --> 03:49:54.046
FOLLOW THE USER PAY PRINCIPLE.

03:49:54.113 --> 03:49:55.915
AGAIN REGISTRATION FEES.

03:49:55.982 --> 03:49:58.618
PROBABLY THE POOREST EXAMPLE

03:49:58.684 --> 03:50:02.121
HERE. BOTH ELECTRIC VEHICLE

03:50:02.188 --> 03:50:04.223
USERS AND GAS USERS ARE GOING

03:50:04.290 --> 03:50:07.026
TO PAY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS

03:50:07.093 --> 03:50:08.294
IRRESPECTIVE OF INCOME. IT'S

03:50:08.361 --> 03:50:10.096
NOT TIED TO ANY INCOME

03:50:10.163 --> 03:50:13.799
SENSITIVITY OR ABILITY TO PAY.

03:50:13.866 --> 03:50:16.068
AND THE ZEV FUEL TAX IS GOING

03:50:16.135 --> 03:50:18.171
TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS

03:50:18.237 --> 03:50:19.939
GASOLINE WITH ROAD USAGE

03:50:20.006 --> 03:50:21.274
CHARGES. AND THIS IS SOMETHING

03:50:21.340 --> 03:50:23.709
THAT YOU'LL YOU'LL HEAR FROM

03:50:23.776 --> 03:50:25.244
VARIOUS PILOT PROGRAMS. AND

03:50:25.311 --> 03:50:27.547
THIS IS KIND OF BACKED BY

03:50:27.613 --> 03:50:28.514
EVIDENCE IN OUR RESEARCH AND

03:50:28.581 --> 03:50:30.149
OTHER RESEARCH AS WELL. TENDS

03:50:30.216 --> 03:50:32.552
TO BE LESS REGRESSIVE THAN

03:50:32.618 --> 03:50:35.188
GASOLINE. SO TYPICALLY MORE

03:50:35.254 --> 03:50:37.857
RURAL DRIVERS AND DRIVERS IN

03:50:37.924 --> 03:50:40.693
LOWER INCOME DISADVANTAGED

03:50:40.760 --> 03:50:43.329
COMMUNITIES TEND TO DRIVE LESS

03:50:43.396 --> 03:50:45.131
FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES. AND SO

03:50:45.198 --> 03:50:48.434
THEY END UP PAYING MORE WHEN

03:50:48.501 --> 03:50:49.702
THEY'RE UNDER A GASOLINE TAX

03:50:49.769 --> 03:50:51.037
SYSTEM. WHEREAS WITH A ROAD

03:50:51.103 --> 03:50:55.208
USAGE CHARGE SYSTEM, IT IT

03:50:55.274 --> 03:50:57.176
BASICALLY GETS RID OF THAT SORT

03:50:57.243 --> 03:50:58.277
OF ADVANTAGE ON THE FUEL

03:50:58.344 --> 03:51:01.347
EFFICIENCY SIDE FOR PAYING LESS

03:51:01.414 --> 03:51:03.149
UNDER THE GAS TAX. SO WE TEND

03:51:03.216 --> 03:51:04.917
TO CONSIDER THIS TO BE SLIGHTLY

03:51:04.984 --> 03:51:07.520
LESS REGRESSIVE THAN THAN A GAS

03:51:07.587 --> 03:51:11.157
TAX OKAY. AND SO YEAH LAST

03:51:11.224 --> 03:51:12.959
THING KIND OF TO SUM ALL OF

03:51:13.025 --> 03:51:15.027
THIS UP, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A

03:51:15.094 --> 03:51:16.562
LOT ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THE ROAD

03:51:16.629 --> 03:51:17.396
USAGE CHARGE. FROM THE

03:51:17.463 --> 03:51:19.065
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE, IT

03:51:19.131 --> 03:51:21.000
KIND OF TICKS A LOT OF THE THE

03:51:21.067 --> 03:51:23.002
BOXES THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHEN

03:51:23.069 --> 03:51:24.003
WE'RE MEASURING THESE THINGS

03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:26.305
ACROSS DIFFERENT METRICS. BUT

03:51:26.372 --> 03:51:28.007
FROM AN IMPLEMENTATION

03:51:28.074 --> 03:51:29.675
PERSPECTIVE STILL HAS LOTS OF

03:51:29.742 --> 03:51:33.012
CHALLENGES TO TO OVERCOME. THE

03:51:33.079 --> 03:51:35.481
COST THAT I MENTIONED IS REALLY

03:51:35.548 --> 03:51:38.584
BIG. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS

03:51:38.651 --> 03:51:40.987
TO BRING THE COST DOWN TO MAKE

03:51:41.053 --> 03:51:43.389
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AT A

03:51:43.456 --> 03:51:44.924
WIDE SCALE MORE REALISTIC. AND

03:51:44.991 --> 03:51:47.260
THEN ONE PIECE THAT I HAVEN'T

03:51:47.326 --> 03:51:49.562
MENTIONED, BUT PERHAPS YOU GUYS

03:51:49.629 --> 03:51:50.363
HAVE HEARD THE PUBLIC

03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:52.465
PERCEPTION PIECE IS REALLY

03:51:52.531 --> 03:51:53.299
IMPORTANT HERE. THERE'S A LOT

03:51:53.366 --> 03:51:57.870
OF MISPERCEPTION OF HOW THE

03:51:57.937 --> 03:52:00.039
ROAD USAGE CHARGE WORKS,

03:52:00.106 --> 03:52:01.207
ESPECIALLY RELATIVE TO THE GAS

03:52:01.274 --> 03:52:03.042
TAX. BUT ONE PROMISING THING,

03:52:03.109 --> 03:52:05.444
RIGHT. AND MAYBE CALTRANS HAS

03:52:05.511 --> 03:52:06.379
KIND OF TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS

03:52:06.445 --> 03:52:08.147
ALREADY. SO FOR THE FOLKS WHO

03:52:08.214 --> 03:52:10.249
WERE INVOLVED IN THE PILOT

03:52:10.316 --> 03:52:11.917
PROGRAM, ONCE, THEY KIND OF

03:52:11.984 --> 03:52:13.953
LEARNED ABOUT HOW HOW IT WORKED,

03:52:14.020 --> 03:52:17.256
THE PERCEPTION OF USING THAT AS

03:52:17.323 --> 03:52:19.659
A PRICING MECHANISM BECAME A

03:52:19.725 --> 03:52:20.993
LOT MORE POSITIVE. AND SO I

03:52:21.060 --> 03:52:23.162
THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT YOU

03:52:23.229 --> 03:52:24.964
YOU'LL REALLY NEED TO DO IS TO

03:52:25.031 --> 03:52:27.033
KIND OF PROMOTE AND EDUCATE

03:52:27.099 --> 03:52:30.169
AWARENESS OF HOW THIS PAYMENT

03:52:30.236 --> 03:52:33.873
FEE REALLY WORKS. THE LAST

03:52:33.939 --> 03:52:36.008
THING THAT I'LL KIND OF LEAVE,

03:52:36.075 --> 03:52:38.277
LEAVE YOU WITH IS THERE ARE

03:52:38.344 --> 03:52:40.279
OTHER PRICING MECHANISMS THAT

03:52:40.346 --> 03:52:42.815
FOLKS ARE, ARE TALKING ABOUT

03:52:42.882 --> 03:52:44.317
AND IMPLEMENTING THROUGHOUT THE

03:52:44.383 --> 03:52:45.217
COUNTRY. THINGS LIKE CONGESTION

03:52:45.284 --> 03:52:48.254
FEES, THINGS THAT MIGHT BE

03:52:48.321 --> 03:52:51.257
CONNECTED TO EMISSIONS. AND ONE

03:52:51.324 --> 03:52:53.092
OF THE THINGS THAT WE KIND OF

03:52:53.159 --> 03:52:55.161
REALLY PUSH FOR OR ADVOCATE TO

03:52:55.227 --> 03:52:58.497
THINK ABOUT IS ALL OF THESE

03:52:58.564 --> 03:52:59.565
HAVE ASSOCIATED SORT OF

03:52:59.632 --> 03:53:01.934
IMPLEMENTATION COSTS AND TO

03:53:02.001 --> 03:53:03.302
STAND UP PILOTS AND PROGRAMS

03:53:03.369 --> 03:53:05.738
FOR THESE THINGS. IF YOU HAVE

03:53:05.805 --> 03:53:08.107
LOTS OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS

03:53:08.174 --> 03:53:09.942
PUSHING THESE PRICING

03:53:10.009 --> 03:53:11.977
MECHANISMS FORWARD, THAT CAN BE

03:53:12.044 --> 03:53:15.314
REALLY COSTLY. AND SO ONE WAY

03:53:15.381 --> 03:53:18.150
TO REALLY THINK ABOUT ONE WAY

03:53:18.217 --> 03:53:19.985
TO HELP PROMOTE A LOT OF THESE

03:53:20.052 --> 03:53:21.654
THINGS IS TO TRY AND PUT THEM

03:53:21.721 --> 03:53:22.888
TOGETHER. RIGHT. SO THE WHAT I

03:53:22.955 --> 03:53:25.358
ALWAYS KIND OF SAY IS, IF YOU

03:53:25.424 --> 03:53:26.225
CAN HAVE THIS BE KIND OF A

03:53:26.292 --> 03:53:27.893
SOFTWARE UPDATE AS OPPOSED TO

03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:29.028
LIKE A HARDWARE UPDATE, THAT

03:53:29.095 --> 03:53:31.130
MIGHT CREATE A LOT MORE

03:53:31.197 --> 03:53:32.365
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP SUPPORT

03:53:32.431 --> 03:53:33.999
DIFFERENT PRICING MECHANISMS

03:53:34.066 --> 03:53:36.435
TOGETHER. YEAH. AND SO I'LL,

03:53:36.502 --> 03:53:38.704
I'LL LEAVE IT THERE FOR THE

03:53:38.771 --> 03:53:40.272
LAST TALK. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING

03:53:40.339 --> 03:53:43.309
TO GO. WE'LL DO QUESTIONS AFTER

03:53:43.376 --> 03:53:45.010
EACH SECTION. UNLESS SOMEBODY

03:53:45.077 --> 03:53:46.946
HAS PRESSING I KNOW MEMBERS DO

03:53:47.012 --> 03:53:49.181
HAVE TO LEAVE. SO IF YOU CAN

03:53:49.248 --> 03:53:51.016
HOLD TILL THE NEXT PERSON.

03:53:51.083 --> 03:53:53.219
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL

03:53:53.285 --> 03:53:55.321
MOVE ON. THANK YOU, DOCTOR CHEN.

03:53:55.388 --> 03:53:57.022
WE'LL MOVE ON TO TRISH HENDREN,

03:53:57.089 --> 03:53:58.424
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, EASTERN

03:53:58.491 --> 03:54:00.960
TRANSPORTATION COALITION. AND

03:54:01.026 --> 03:54:02.428
THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR

03:54:02.495 --> 03:54:03.863
QUESTIONS FOR THE FIRST PANEL.

03:54:03.929 --> 03:54:06.065
GREAT. THANK YOU. I WANT TO DO

03:54:06.132 --> 03:54:07.199
A SOUND CHECK BECAUSE I'M

03:54:07.266 --> 03:54:08.701
COMING THE FARTHEST IN INTO

03:54:08.768 --> 03:54:10.136
YOUR ROOM TODAY. YES. WE CAN

03:54:10.202 --> 03:54:11.804
HEAR YOU. WELL THANK YOU SO

03:54:11.871 --> 03:54:13.539
MUCH. GREAT. WONDERFUL. THANK

03:54:13.606 --> 03:54:15.174
YOU. SO ACTUALLY, I WANT TO

03:54:15.241 --> 03:54:17.543
REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON WHY

03:54:17.610 --> 03:54:19.078
WE'RE ALL HERE BY GOING BACK IN

03:54:19.145 --> 03:54:21.180
TIME A LITTLE BIT. IF WE CAN GO

03:54:21.247 --> 03:54:22.148
TO THE NEXT SLIDE, MAYBE I

03:54:22.214 --> 03:54:24.417
SHOULD SAY GO BACK IN TIME A

03:54:24.483 --> 03:54:26.552
LITTLE BIT MORE BACK TO 1919.

03:54:26.619 --> 03:54:28.554
AND THAT'S WHEN OREGON ACTUALLY

03:54:28.621 --> 03:54:30.189
BROUGHT OUR COUNTRY THE STATE

03:54:30.256 --> 03:54:32.091
FUEL TAX. AND YOU MIGHT BE

03:54:32.158 --> 03:54:34.126
THINKING, WHY AM I GOING SO FAR

03:54:34.193 --> 03:54:35.361
BACK IN TIME? BESIDES, I STILL

03:54:35.428 --> 03:54:37.062
THINK THE FORD MODEL T SEDAN IS

03:54:37.129 --> 03:54:39.165
A PRETTY COOL LOOKING CAR. AT

03:54:39.231 --> 03:54:40.132
THAT TIME, WE BASICALLY HAD

03:54:40.199 --> 03:54:42.168
THAT KIND OF CAR. AND SO WHAT

03:54:42.234 --> 03:54:43.836
IN ESSENCE, THE FUEL TAX BECAME

03:54:43.903 --> 03:54:46.038
FOR OUR COUNTRY WAS A USER FEE.

03:54:46.105 --> 03:54:48.607
SO IF YOU DROVE A MILE, THEN

03:54:48.674 --> 03:54:50.042
YOU PRETTY MUCH PAID THE SAME

03:54:50.109 --> 03:54:51.243
AMOUNT FOR THAT MILE AND A FUEL

03:54:51.310 --> 03:54:53.712
TAX. SO THEN IF YOU GO TO THE

03:54:53.779 --> 03:54:55.147
NEXT SLIDE AND WE LOOK AT TODAY,

03:54:55.214 --> 03:54:57.316
WE LOVE CHOICES IN OUR COUNTRY.

03:54:57.383 --> 03:54:59.118
AND WE GOT A LOT OF THEM WHEN

03:54:59.185 --> 03:55:01.120
IT COMES TO OUR VEHICLES. SO WE

03:55:01.187 --> 03:55:02.321
HAVE OVER 300 MODELS MADE IN

03:55:02.388 --> 03:55:03.956
THE US. LOTS OF DIFFERENT FUEL

03:55:04.023 --> 03:55:05.191
EFFICIENCY AND SOME NOT USING

03:55:05.257 --> 03:55:06.959
ANY FUEL AT ALL. SO WHAT THAT

03:55:07.026 --> 03:55:09.328
REALLY MEANS IS THAT LINK

03:55:09.395 --> 03:55:11.931
BETWEEN USING A MILE OF A ROAD

03:55:11.997 --> 03:55:13.265
AND PAYING FOR THAT IS REALLY

03:55:13.332 --> 03:55:15.401
BROKEN. SO IF WE GO TO THE NEXT

03:55:15.468 --> 03:55:17.436
SLIDE, I'LL USE MY CAR AS AN

03:55:17.503 --> 03:55:19.138
EXAMPLE. SO THAT'S OLD BESSIE.

03:55:19.205 --> 03:55:20.940
SHE'S THE ONE ON THE LEFT THERE.

03:55:21.006 --> 03:55:22.241
SO I INHERITED HER FROM MY LATE

03:55:22.308 --> 03:55:24.376
FATHER. SHE'S OVER 25 YEARS OLD,

03:55:24.443 --> 03:55:26.412
BUT SHE STILL STILL GOING

03:55:26.479 --> 03:55:28.180
PRETTY GOOD. AND I LOOKED AT

03:55:28.247 --> 03:55:29.548
DOWN THE ROAD. MY NEIGHBOR GOT

03:55:29.615 --> 03:55:32.151
A NEW CAR A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,

03:55:32.218 --> 03:55:33.085
THE TOYOTA CAMRY. AND I JUST

03:55:33.152 --> 03:55:35.187
DID SOME, YOU KNOW, CALCULATION.

03:55:35.254 --> 03:55:36.388
WE'RE BOTH DRIVING ABOUT 12,000

03:55:36.455 --> 03:55:38.958
MILES A YEAR ON AVERAGE. AND

03:55:39.024 --> 03:55:41.093
WHAT ARE WE PAYING IN FUEL TAX?

03:55:41.160 --> 03:55:42.461
AND THIS IS KIND OF THE POINT

03:55:42.528 --> 03:55:44.463
HERE THAT WE'RE AT THIS USER

03:55:44.530 --> 03:55:45.331
PAY CROSSROAD THAT ALAN HAD HAD

03:55:45.397 --> 03:55:47.032
TOUCHED ON, WHICH FOR 100 YEARS

03:55:47.099 --> 03:55:49.268
HAS KIND OF BEEN OUR PHILOSOPHY

03:55:49.335 --> 03:55:50.503
OF FUNDING TRANSPORTATION. SO

03:55:50.569 --> 03:55:52.037
WHY IS IT THAT BECAUSE OF THE

03:55:52.104 --> 03:55:54.106
CAR THAT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A NEW

03:55:54.173 --> 03:55:55.841
CAR, BE ABLE TO AFFORD A NEW

03:55:55.908 --> 03:55:57.109
CAR, THAT I'M PAYING TWICE AS

03:55:57.176 --> 03:55:59.078
MUCH IN FUEL TAX? SO THAT'S

03:55:59.144 --> 03:56:00.312
SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED TO

03:56:00.379 --> 03:56:01.113
THINK ABOUT TOGETHER AS A

03:56:01.180 --> 03:56:03.015
COUNTRY, AS WE'RE FIGURING OUT

03:56:03.082 --> 03:56:04.149
THAT SUSTAINABLE PATH FORWARD.

03:56:04.216 --> 03:56:05.885
SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE,

03:56:05.951 --> 03:56:08.454
PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT

03:56:08.521 --> 03:56:09.288
WE'RE GOING TO FACE IS THAT

03:56:09.355 --> 03:56:12.124
PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH

03:56:12.191 --> 03:56:13.926
THEY PAY OR HOW LITTLE THEY PAY,

03:56:13.993 --> 03:56:16.061
QUITE FRANKLY, IN FUEL TAX. AND

03:56:16.128 --> 03:56:17.730
THAT'S BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

03:56:17.796 --> 03:56:18.864
WHEN THAT DECISION MADE. I'D

03:56:18.931 --> 03:56:20.132
LOVE IT IF ANYONE COULD ANSWER

03:56:20.199 --> 03:56:21.367
THAT QUESTION, THAT WHEN YOU

03:56:21.433 --> 03:56:23.335
GET YOUR RECEIPT, WHEN YOU FILL

03:56:23.402 --> 03:56:24.970
UP AT THE GAS STATION, THAT IT

03:56:25.037 --> 03:56:26.605
DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IS

03:56:26.672 --> 03:56:27.973
FOR FUEL AND FOR TAXES. SO WE

03:56:28.040 --> 03:56:29.275
REALLY HAVE A CHALLENGE OF

03:56:29.341 --> 03:56:31.076
TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH THE

03:56:31.143 --> 03:56:33.546
PUBLIC ABOUT THE PROBLEM WE'RE

03:56:33.612 --> 03:56:34.613
FACING, WHICH IS THIS DECLINING

03:56:34.680 --> 03:56:37.249
COLLECTION OF FUEL TAX. SO IF

03:56:37.316 --> 03:56:39.251
WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE, PART

03:56:39.318 --> 03:56:43.255
OF THIS ISSUE, Þ SEE IF WE CAN

03:56:43.322 --> 03:56:45.357
GO TO THE NEXT ONE. DID THAT

03:56:45.424 --> 03:56:49.762
WORK? OH, AM I FROZEN OR ARE

03:56:49.828 --> 03:56:53.098
YOU GUYS FROZEN? THERE WE GO.

03:56:53.165 --> 03:56:54.366
OKAY. WE'RE UNFROZEN. WONDERFUL.

03:56:54.433 --> 03:56:56.035
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LATE ON THE

03:56:56.101 --> 03:56:57.336
EAST COAST, SO MAYBE THINGS ARE

03:56:57.403 --> 03:56:59.305
MOVING A LITTLE SLOW ON MY END.

03:56:59.371 --> 03:57:00.172
THE OTHER CHALLENGE IS THAT

03:57:00.239 --> 03:57:02.107
FROM THE PUBLIC PERSPECTIVE,

03:57:02.174 --> 03:57:04.209
THEY ACTUALLY SEE OR THINK THAT

03:57:04.276 --> 03:57:05.210
THE AMOUNT OF TRANSPORTATION

03:57:05.277 --> 03:57:07.580
REVENUE WE HAVE IS GOING UP OR

03:57:07.646 --> 03:57:09.048
STAYING THE SAME. SO AGAIN,

03:57:09.114 --> 03:57:11.283
KIND OF GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE,

03:57:11.350 --> 03:57:12.885
PUTTING THIS ALL TOGETHER IS

03:57:12.952 --> 03:57:13.919
YOU REALLY ARE FACING A

03:57:13.986 --> 03:57:16.088
CHALLENGE THAT YOU ALL ARE VERY

03:57:16.155 --> 03:57:17.323
AWARE OF. I THINK FROM YOUR

03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:18.223
LAST HEARING REALLY GOING INTO

03:57:18.290 --> 03:57:20.159
SOME OF THE DETAILS ABOUT THESE

03:57:20.225 --> 03:57:21.327
PROJECTIONS, BUT IT IS EVERY

03:57:21.393 --> 03:57:22.928
MILE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING THE

03:57:22.995 --> 03:57:24.163
AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT WE ARE

03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:26.865
ABLE TO HAVE TO CREATE. AS

03:57:26.932 --> 03:57:28.534
MADAM CHAIR HAD MENTIONED, A

03:57:28.601 --> 03:57:30.235
SUSTAINABLE, RELIABLE, POTHOLE

03:57:30.302 --> 03:57:32.571
FREE TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION

03:57:32.638 --> 03:57:34.306
SYSTEM. WE'RE HAVING LESS

03:57:34.373 --> 03:57:36.075
REVENUE. SO GOING TO THE NEXT

03:57:36.141 --> 03:57:37.276
SLIDE. WHAT STATES ARE DOING.

03:57:37.343 --> 03:57:39.311
SO BOTH ALAN AND DOUG TOUCHED

03:57:39.378 --> 03:57:40.980
ON THESE A BIT. THOSE ANNUAL

03:57:41.046 --> 03:57:42.147
FLAT FEES, KILOWATT HOUR FEES

03:57:42.214 --> 03:57:44.216
AND THIS DISTANCE BASED

03:57:44.283 --> 03:57:46.018
APPROACH WHICH US EAST COAST IS

03:57:46.085 --> 03:57:47.186
APPARENTLY CALLED A MILEAGE

03:57:47.252 --> 03:57:48.354
BASED USER FEE. AND OUT WEST

03:57:48.420 --> 03:57:50.122
Y'ALL CALL IT THE ROAD USER

03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:52.625
CHARGE. SO GOING TO THE NEXT

03:57:52.691 --> 03:57:53.525
SLIDE, YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING

03:57:53.592 --> 03:57:55.227
AGAIN, WHY IS AN EAST COASTER

03:57:55.294 --> 03:57:57.129
IN THIS DISCUSSION? AND I'M

03:57:57.196 --> 03:57:59.298
GLAD, MADAM CHAIR, THAT IN YOUR

03:57:59.365 --> 03:58:00.699
OPENING COMMENTS YOU TALKED

03:58:00.766 --> 03:58:02.201
ABOUT OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

03:58:02.267 --> 03:58:04.470
IS A NATIONAL NEED AND ALSO

03:58:04.536 --> 03:58:05.337
HAVING SUSTAINABLE REVENUE FOR

03:58:05.404 --> 03:58:07.973
THAT SYSTEM IS A NATIONAL NEED.

03:58:08.040 --> 03:58:09.308
SO THIS IS NOT AN EAST COAST

03:58:09.375 --> 03:58:11.343
WEST COAST ISSUE. WE ALL NEED

03:58:11.410 --> 03:58:12.211
TO HAVE THIS RELIABLE

03:58:12.277 --> 03:58:14.079
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN ORDER

03:58:14.146 --> 03:58:15.414
TO REALLY BE THE ENGINE OF OUR

03:58:15.481 --> 03:58:17.516
ECONOMY. BUT HOW DO WE REALLY

03:58:17.583 --> 03:58:19.284
CONVINCE THE USERS OF THAT

03:58:19.351 --> 03:58:20.886
SYSTEM THAT TRANSPORTATION IS

03:58:20.953 --> 03:58:22.121
WORTH PAYING FOR? AND SO I

03:58:22.187 --> 03:58:24.490
THINK IT'S GREAT THAT I'M ABLE

03:58:24.556 --> 03:58:25.457
TO ZOOM IN THERE, LITERALLY,

03:58:25.524 --> 03:58:27.126
AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

03:58:27.192 --> 03:58:28.927
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH YOU ALL,

03:58:28.994 --> 03:58:31.030
BECAUSE IN THE IF WE GO TO THE

03:58:31.096 --> 03:58:33.198
NEXT SLIDE, A BIG FOCUS OF SOME

03:58:33.265 --> 03:58:34.099
OF THE WORK, YOU CAN CLICK

03:58:34.166 --> 03:58:36.201
THROUGH THE NEXT BIT THERE THAT

03:58:36.268 --> 03:58:37.269
WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON WITH

03:58:37.336 --> 03:58:38.937
THIS GROUP OF 20 STATES ON THE

03:58:39.004 --> 03:58:40.472
EAST COAST IS REALLY ON THAT

03:58:40.539 --> 03:58:41.306
DISTANCE BASED APPROACH. AND

03:58:41.373 --> 03:58:43.409
THE REASON IF YOU GO TO THE

03:58:43.475 --> 03:58:45.110
NEXT SLIDE IS BECAUSE OF A

03:58:45.177 --> 03:58:46.645
FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM, WHICH I

03:58:46.712 --> 03:58:47.980
KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO BEEN A

03:58:48.047 --> 03:58:50.115
RECIPIENT OF SOME OF THESE

03:58:50.182 --> 03:58:51.383
GRANTS, WHICH REALLY WAS A GAME

03:58:51.450 --> 03:58:53.185
CHANGER, BECAUSE TALKING ABOUT

03:58:53.252 --> 03:58:55.087
HOW YOU FUND TRANSPORTATION IS

03:58:55.154 --> 03:58:58.023
HARD. AND AGAIN, AS SEVERAL OF

03:58:58.090 --> 03:58:59.124
THE SPEAKERS HAVE ALLUDED TO,

03:58:59.191 --> 03:59:00.392
THE PUBLIC DOESN'T REALLY HAVE

03:59:00.459 --> 03:59:02.461
THAT MUCH. WE NEVER TOLD THEM

03:59:02.528 --> 03:59:04.196
ABOUT HOW THIS GETS PAID. SO

03:59:04.263 --> 03:59:05.931
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WE

03:59:05.998 --> 03:59:07.533
NEED TO DO TOGETHER. AND USING

03:59:07.599 --> 03:59:09.201
THESE GRANT FUNDS TO KIND OF

03:59:09.268 --> 03:59:10.135
GIVE PEOPLE REAL WORLD, HANDS

03:59:10.202 --> 03:59:12.037
ON EXPERIENCE ABOUT THIS

03:59:12.104 --> 03:59:13.272
POTENTIAL NEW WAY OF FUNDING

03:59:13.338 --> 03:59:15.040
TRANSPORTATION. SO THAT'S WHAT

03:59:15.107 --> 03:59:17.076
WE'VE DONE ON THIS GROUP OF

03:59:17.142 --> 03:59:18.343
EASTERN 20 STATES. WE'VE DONE

03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:20.079
14 PASSENGER PILOTS AND THREE

03:59:20.145 --> 03:59:22.147
COMMERCIAL PILOTS. SO GOING TO

03:59:22.214 --> 03:59:24.049
THE NEXT SLIDE, BUT I REALLY

03:59:24.116 --> 03:59:26.085
WANTED TO KIND OF BRING TO YOU

03:59:26.151 --> 03:59:27.920
ALL FOR FOR DISCUSSION IS WHAT

03:59:27.986 --> 03:59:29.154
HAVE WE LEARNED FROM ALL THOSE

03:59:29.221 --> 03:59:30.856
PILOTS THAT WE'RE KIND OF

03:59:30.923 --> 03:59:32.424
TALKING ABOUT IN THE EAST COAST,

03:59:32.491 --> 03:59:34.426
WHAT YOU ALL HAVE LEARNED IN

03:59:34.493 --> 03:59:35.194
CALIFORNIA AND STATES, YOU KNOW,

03:59:35.260 --> 03:59:36.895
IN BETWEEN. SO WE'VE LEARNED A

03:59:36.962 --> 03:59:39.064
LOT. AND I THINK A BOTTOM LINE

03:59:39.131 --> 03:59:40.399
IS THAT THIS TRANSITION TO A

03:59:40.466 --> 03:59:43.068
DIFFERENT WAY OF PAYING FOR

03:59:43.135 --> 03:59:44.236
TRANSPORTATION, DIFFERENT THAN

03:59:44.303 --> 03:59:46.972
THE FUEL TAX, IS FEASIBLE. THE

03:59:47.039 --> 03:59:49.241
CHALLENGE IS CHANGE IS HARD.

03:59:49.308 --> 03:59:51.009
AND THESE FOUR KIND OF BARRIERS,

03:59:51.076 --> 03:59:53.078
I WOULD SAY ARE REALLY KEEP

03:59:53.145 --> 03:59:54.313
BUBBLING UP. AND AGAIN, THEY'VE

03:59:54.379 --> 03:59:55.147
BEEN TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT

03:59:55.214 --> 03:59:57.116
ALREADY, BUT I WANT TO GO

03:59:57.182 --> 03:59:58.684
THROUGH EACH AND TALK ABOUT

03:59:58.751 --> 03:59:59.918
SOME WAYS THAT WE'RE FINDING TO

03:59:59.985 --> 04:00:01.520
GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE

04:00:01.587 --> 04:00:02.721
BARRIERS. SO GOING TO THE NEXT

04:00:02.788 --> 04:00:04.022
SLIDE, LET'S START WITH THE GAP

04:00:04.089 --> 04:00:05.190
AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

04:00:05.257 --> 04:00:06.091
PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING. LET'S GO

04:00:06.158 --> 04:00:08.961
TO THE NEXT ONE. SO WHAT WE

04:00:09.027 --> 04:00:10.262
FOUND IN THE WORK WE'VE DONE

04:00:10.329 --> 04:00:12.531
WITH THOSE PILOTS WITH FOCUS

04:00:12.598 --> 04:00:15.134
GROUPS SURVEYS IS WE JUST GOT

04:00:15.200 --> 04:00:19.238
TO TALK ABOUT THE VALUE I CONFESS

04:00:19.304 --> 04:00:21.173
TO BE A TOTAL TRANSPORTATION

04:00:21.240 --> 04:00:23.242
GEEK. SO I THINK IT'S EPIC. BUT

04:00:23.308 --> 04:00:24.076
QUITE FRANKLY, SO DO YOUR

04:00:24.143 --> 04:00:26.044
NEIGHBORS. I MEAN, WE ALL USE

04:00:26.111 --> 04:00:27.079
TRANSPORTATION FOR THOSE

04:00:27.146 --> 04:00:28.213
PACKAGES AT OUR FRONT DOOR OR

04:00:28.280 --> 04:00:29.915
GETTING GROCERIES GOING TO THE

04:00:29.982 --> 04:00:31.683
DOCTOR'S OFFICE, BUT WE JUST

04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:32.885
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT, MAYBE AS

04:00:32.951 --> 04:00:35.320
OPENLY AS WE AS OTHER COUNTRIES

04:00:35.387 --> 04:00:37.289
DO. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN I

04:00:37.356 --> 04:00:39.658
THINK WE CAN REALLY TALK ABOUT

04:00:39.725 --> 04:00:40.058
THE IMPORTANCE OF

04:00:40.125 --> 04:00:41.260
TRANSPORTATION, AND PEOPLE WILL

04:00:41.326 --> 04:00:42.528
ENGAGE WITH THAT. WE'VE SEEN

04:00:42.594 --> 04:00:44.530
THAT. AND AGAIN, THESE FOCUS

04:00:44.596 --> 04:00:45.430
GROUPS AND PARTICIPANT SURVEYS

04:00:45.497 --> 04:00:47.933
THAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN

04:00:48.000 --> 04:00:49.067
HAVING THAT RELIABLE

04:00:49.134 --> 04:00:51.603
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO GOING

04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:53.105
TO THE NEXT SLIDE, WE'VE ALSO

04:00:53.172 --> 04:00:55.541
LEARNED ON THIS KIND OF GAP IN

04:00:55.607 --> 04:00:56.909
PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING THAT

04:00:56.975 --> 04:00:58.944
NOTHING BEATS LIKE REAL WORLD,

04:00:59.011 --> 04:01:01.180
HANDS ON EXPERIENCE AND WAS

04:01:01.246 --> 04:01:03.148
TALKED ABOUT IN AN EARLIER

04:01:03.215 --> 04:01:05.217
PRESENTER THAT WHEN THE PILOT

04:01:05.284 --> 04:01:06.885
HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA,

04:01:06.952 --> 04:01:09.021
PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

04:01:09.087 --> 04:01:10.455
A DISTANCE BASED APPROACH COULD

04:01:10.522 --> 04:01:11.990
BE AND THEIR SUPPORT OF THAT

04:01:12.057 --> 04:01:13.358
WENT UP, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

04:01:13.425 --> 04:01:15.227
LIKE, OH, IT'S NOT WHAT I

04:01:15.294 --> 04:01:16.028
THOUGHT. THIS KIND OF THEORY

04:01:16.094 --> 04:01:17.095
BECOMES SOMETHING VERY

04:01:17.162 --> 04:01:18.263
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO

04:01:18.330 --> 04:01:20.933
A REAL WORLD PILOT. AND AGAIN,

04:01:20.999 --> 04:01:22.100
THAT'S WHY WE'VE DONE 14 OF

04:01:22.167 --> 04:01:23.368
THESE. YOU'RE THINKING, THAT'S

04:01:23.435 --> 04:01:25.304
A LOT. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE

04:01:25.370 --> 04:01:25.771
HAVE DIFFERENT STATES,

04:01:25.838 --> 04:01:26.338
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. SO

04:01:26.405 --> 04:01:28.240
THAT'S JUST KEY FOR US TO

04:01:28.307 --> 04:01:29.908
CONTINUE TO DO THIS REAL WORLD

04:01:29.975 --> 04:01:31.210
PILOT AS A WAY TO CLOSE THAT

04:01:31.276 --> 04:01:34.213
GAP AND UNDERSTANDING. SO GOING

04:01:34.279 --> 04:01:36.114
TO THE NEXT SLIDE, I THINK ALSO

04:01:36.181 --> 04:01:38.584
WE CAN CLOSE THAT GAP BY MAKING

04:01:38.650 --> 04:01:40.252
IT PERSONAL. SO EVERYBODY WANTS

04:01:40.319 --> 04:01:42.187
TO KNOW WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR

04:01:42.254 --> 04:01:43.155
THEM, FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLD FOR

04:01:43.222 --> 04:01:45.224
THEIR WALLET. AND SO WE HAVE A

04:01:45.290 --> 04:01:46.425
CALCULATOR ON OUR WEBSITE THAT

04:01:46.491 --> 04:01:48.126
YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR CAR TYPE

04:01:48.193 --> 04:01:50.128
AND HOW MANY MILES YOU DRIVE.

04:01:50.195 --> 04:01:51.296
AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOUR

04:01:51.363 --> 04:01:53.031
ANNUAL COST WOULD BE FOR A FUEL

04:01:53.098 --> 04:01:54.666
TAX VERSUS A DISTANCE BASED

04:01:54.733 --> 04:01:56.268
APPROACH. AND I'M THE MOM OF

04:01:56.335 --> 04:01:58.003
TWO TEENAGE GIRLS, AND IF YOU

04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:59.371
DON'T HAVE VIDEOS, THEN NO ONE

04:01:59.438 --> 04:02:00.939
IS PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU. SO

04:02:01.006 --> 04:02:03.008
WE NEED LOTS OF VIDEOS, FUN

04:02:03.075 --> 04:02:04.309
VIDEOS TO EXPLAIN WHAT IN THE

04:02:04.376 --> 04:02:05.210
WORLD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO

04:02:05.277 --> 04:02:07.112
AGAIN, THERE'S THIS GAP IN

04:02:07.179 --> 04:02:08.647
UNDERSTANDING. SO GOING TO THE

04:02:08.714 --> 04:02:12.217
NEXT SLIDE PRIVACY. SO THIS IS

04:02:12.284 --> 04:02:13.886
A BARRIER THAT IS VERY REAL.

04:02:13.952 --> 04:02:15.888
AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS

04:02:15.954 --> 04:02:18.223
SLIDE WHAT WE FOUND WITH THE

04:02:18.290 --> 04:02:19.358
PRIVACY CONCERN WHICH IS VERY

04:02:19.424 --> 04:02:21.126
STRONG VERY NEGATIVE ABOUT A

04:02:21.193 --> 04:02:22.995
DISTANCE BASED APPROACH BECAUSE

04:02:23.061 --> 04:02:25.097
PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT IT IS

04:02:25.163 --> 04:02:27.165
DEVICES IN THEIR CAR, THEY'RE

04:02:27.232 --> 04:02:28.467
BEING TRACKED, IT IS GOVERNMENT

04:02:28.533 --> 04:02:31.103
INVASION, ETC. BUT THEN WHEN

04:02:31.169 --> 04:02:32.004
YOU ACTUALLY INTERACT WITH

04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:34.006
TECHNOLOGY, WHAT YOU SEE IS

04:02:34.072 --> 04:02:35.240
PEOPLE REALIZE WHAT THIS IT'S

04:02:35.307 --> 04:02:36.942
NOT WHAT THEY THINK IT IS. AND

04:02:37.009 --> 04:02:39.645
IT'S A VERY PERSONAL CHOICE

04:02:39.711 --> 04:02:40.946
BASED APPROACH IS HOW THESE

04:02:41.013 --> 04:02:42.180
PROGRAMS ARE BEING DESIGNED.

04:02:42.247 --> 04:02:44.082
AND I'M REALLY EXCITED. WE'RE

04:02:44.149 --> 04:02:45.384
GOING TO HEAR FROM FOUR OF THE

04:02:45.450 --> 04:02:46.985
PROGRAMS LATER IN YOUR SESSION.

04:02:47.052 --> 04:02:49.488
BUT WHAT THIS DARK BLUE VERSUS

04:02:49.554 --> 04:02:50.889
LIGHT BLUE IS SHOWING IS ACROSS

04:02:50.956 --> 04:02:53.191
THE BOARD DECREASING CONCERN.

04:02:53.258 --> 04:02:54.993
AND SO AGAIN THAT IMPORTANCE OF

04:02:55.060 --> 04:02:57.229
ADDRESSING PRIVACY IS A REAL

04:02:57.296 --> 04:02:59.364
THING. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

04:02:59.431 --> 04:03:01.099
THAT AND EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC

04:03:01.166 --> 04:03:03.135
HOW THEIR PRIVACY IS BEING

04:03:03.201 --> 04:03:05.103
PROTECTED. IF WE CHOOSE TO MOVE

04:03:05.170 --> 04:03:07.039
TO THIS DIFFERENT WAY OF

04:03:07.105 --> 04:03:08.473
FUNDING TRANSPORTATION. SO

04:03:08.540 --> 04:03:10.108
GOING TO THE NEXT BARRIER, GO

04:03:10.175 --> 04:03:13.478
TO THE NEXT SLIDE TO UNFAIRNESS.

04:03:13.545 --> 04:03:16.648
SO RIGHT AFTER PRIVACY CONCERNS

04:03:16.715 --> 04:03:17.950
AGAIN CHANGING FROM A FUEL TAX

04:03:18.016 --> 04:03:19.217
TO SOMETHING ELSE COMES THIS

04:03:19.284 --> 04:03:22.955
ONE, WHICH IS IS THIS FAIR OR

04:03:23.021 --> 04:03:24.222
HOW ARE WE AS A USER PAY

04:03:24.289 --> 04:03:26.425
PRINCIPLE FAIR, ESPECIALLY TO

04:03:26.491 --> 04:03:27.059
RURAL COMMUNITIES? WHICH MAKES

04:03:27.125 --> 04:03:30.162
A LOT OF SENSE IF WE GO TO A

04:03:30.228 --> 04:03:31.029
DISTANCE BASED APPROACH. RURAL

04:03:31.096 --> 04:03:32.998
COMMUNITIES ARE DRIVING MORE

04:03:33.065 --> 04:03:34.266
MILES BECAUSE THEY'RE DRIVING

04:03:34.333 --> 04:03:36.969
FARTHER TO DO THEIR DAILY

04:03:37.035 --> 04:03:38.236
ACTIVITIES. AND SO WHAT WE

04:03:38.303 --> 04:03:40.172
FOUND, THOUGH, IF WE BRING DATA

04:03:40.238 --> 04:03:41.340
INTO THIS DISCUSSION AND ALL

04:03:41.406 --> 04:03:43.141
THOSE YELLOW LITTLE BOXES ON

04:03:43.208 --> 04:03:44.910
THIS SLIDE ARE SHOWING THAT ON

04:03:44.977 --> 04:03:47.546
AVERAGE, RURAL HOUSEHOLD WILL

04:03:47.612 --> 04:03:49.348
PAY LESS UNDER A DISTANCE BASED

04:03:49.414 --> 04:03:51.516
APPROACH COMPARED TO THE FUEL

04:03:51.583 --> 04:03:53.085
TAX. AND BEFORE YOU GUYS THINK

04:03:53.151 --> 04:03:55.153
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO MATH, I

04:03:55.220 --> 04:03:57.155
PROMISE YOU I DO SOMEONE ELSE

04:03:57.222 --> 04:03:58.357
CHECK MY NUMBERS. THE REASON

04:03:58.423 --> 04:03:59.992
THIS RESULT IS WHAT IT IS, IS

04:04:00.058 --> 04:04:01.626
BECAUSE ON AVERAGE, RURAL

04:04:01.693 --> 04:04:02.694
COMMUNITIES HAVE LARGER, OLDER

04:04:02.761 --> 04:04:05.197
VEHICLES. SO TRANSLATING ALL

04:04:05.263 --> 04:04:06.431
THAT, THAT MEANS THEY'RE PAYING

04:04:06.498 --> 04:04:08.100
MORE TODAY IN FUEL TAXES THAN

04:04:08.166 --> 04:04:09.534
SOME OF THEIR URBAN

04:04:09.601 --> 04:04:10.369
COUNTERPARTS. SO AGAIN, IF

04:04:10.435 --> 04:04:12.070
WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE WITH

04:04:12.137 --> 04:04:13.205
RURAL COMMUNITIES, WE NEED TO

04:04:13.271 --> 04:04:15.207
EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY

04:04:15.273 --> 04:04:17.075
IS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED AS FAR AS

04:04:17.142 --> 04:04:19.144
HOW TO ADDRESS THAT FAIRNESS.

04:04:19.211 --> 04:04:20.879
KIND OF REALLY STRONG REACTION

04:04:20.946 --> 04:04:23.181
ON THAT NEXT SLIDE. EVS HAVE

04:04:23.248 --> 04:04:25.250
BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES.

04:04:25.317 --> 04:04:27.319
SO THERE'S LOTS OF NUMBERS ON

04:04:27.386 --> 04:04:29.187
THIS SLIDE. BUT THERE'S KIND OF

04:04:29.254 --> 04:04:30.055
TWO MAIN TAKEAWAYS FOR THIS

04:04:30.122 --> 04:04:31.523
THAT WE HAVE LEARNED ON

04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:33.558
ADDRESSING THIS FAIRNESS ISSUE.

04:04:33.625 --> 04:04:34.993
SO FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE NOT

04:04:35.060 --> 04:04:37.863
FACING AN EV GENERATED REVENUE

04:04:37.929 --> 04:04:40.165
ISSUE. YES THEY'RE PART OF THE

04:04:40.232 --> 04:04:42.200
ISSUE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SEEN,

04:04:42.267 --> 04:04:43.035
AS DOUG MENTIONED, OVER 41

04:04:43.101 --> 04:04:45.270
STATES HAVE EV REGISTRATION

04:04:45.337 --> 04:04:46.972
FEES. THAT IS A WAY TO HAVE

04:04:47.039 --> 04:04:49.074
THEM CONTRIBUTE TO PAYING TO

04:04:49.141 --> 04:04:50.342
USING THE ROADS. BUT OUR

04:04:50.409 --> 04:04:51.843
REVENUE DECLINE IS REALLY

04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:54.146
BECAUSE THOSE VEHICLES, THE ICE

04:04:54.212 --> 04:04:55.414
VEHICLES ARE GOING FARTHER ON

04:04:55.480 --> 04:04:57.983
THAT TANK OF GAS. SO OUR

04:04:58.050 --> 04:04:59.317
SOLUTIONS NEED TO GET ALIGNED

04:04:59.384 --> 04:05:01.386
WITH KIND OF THE ISSUE THAT

04:05:01.453 --> 04:05:02.487
WE'RE FACING. AND AGAIN, I

04:05:02.554 --> 04:05:04.222
THINK VIRGINIA'S PROGRAM, WHICH

04:05:04.289 --> 04:05:05.057
WILL SCOTT WILL TALK ABOUT

04:05:05.123 --> 04:05:07.092
LATER, IS A GREAT APPROACH TO

04:05:07.159 --> 04:05:08.460
TRY TO ADDRESS TODAY'S REAL

04:05:08.527 --> 04:05:09.928
ISSUE, WHICH IS IMPROVED

04:05:09.995 --> 04:05:12.130
EFFICIENCY AS WELL AS EVS. OKAY,

04:05:12.197 --> 04:05:14.199
SO THE LAST BIG BARRIER I

04:05:14.266 --> 04:05:16.034
WANTED TO TOUCH ON, AGAIN, OF

04:05:16.101 --> 04:05:17.836
THE FOUR THINGS THAT WE'VE

04:05:17.903 --> 04:05:19.171
LEARNED FROM ALL THIS WORK THAT

04:05:19.237 --> 04:05:21.506
WE'VE DONE FROM OUR STATES AND

04:05:21.573 --> 04:05:22.340
FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IS

04:05:22.407 --> 04:05:24.409
REALLY ON THAT COST. AND ALAN

04:05:24.476 --> 04:05:27.245
MENTIONED THIS. SO THE FUEL TAX

04:05:27.312 --> 04:05:28.080
IS CHEAP TO COLLECT. WE FIGURED

04:05:28.146 --> 04:05:31.683
OUT OVER 100 YEARS HOW TO DO IT

04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:32.117
VERY EFFICIENTLY AND

04:05:32.184 --> 04:05:34.019
EFFECTIVELY. SO ANY CHANGE THAT

04:05:34.086 --> 04:05:35.253
WE MAKE, WHETHER IT BE KILOWATT

04:05:35.320 --> 04:05:36.822
HOUR FEE, PACKAGE DELIVERY, YOU

04:05:36.888 --> 04:05:39.091
NAME IT, IT WAS LIKELY GOING TO

04:05:39.157 --> 04:05:40.659
BE MORE EXPENSIVE. SO WHAT WE

04:05:40.725 --> 04:05:41.927
NEED TO DO TOGETHER AS A

04:05:41.993 --> 04:05:43.795
COUNTRY, THROUGH ALL THE

04:05:43.862 --> 04:05:44.396
DIFFERENT PILOTS AND PROGRAMS,

04:05:44.463 --> 04:05:45.931
IS SHARE WITH EACH OTHER HOW

04:05:45.997 --> 04:05:47.165
WE'RE FIGURING OUT WAYS TO

04:05:47.232 --> 04:05:49.167
LOWER THAT ADMIN COST. SO FOR

04:05:49.234 --> 04:05:50.936
EXAMPLE, WE JUST DID AN EV

04:05:51.002 --> 04:05:53.472
PILOT OR A PILOT SEASON IN NEW

04:05:53.538 --> 04:05:54.973
JERSEY WITH EV OWNERS TO TRY TO

04:05:55.040 --> 04:05:57.142
THINK, HOW COULD WE DESIGN AN

04:05:57.209 --> 04:05:59.177
EV CHOICE, DISTANCE BASED

04:05:59.244 --> 04:06:00.078
APPROACH FOR THAT STATE THAT

04:06:00.145 --> 04:06:02.514
WOULD BE COST EFFECTIVE TO

04:06:02.581 --> 04:06:04.249
IMPLEMENT? SO LET'S AGAIN USE

04:06:04.316 --> 04:06:05.050
PILOTS AND IMPLEMENTATION IDEAS

04:06:05.117 --> 04:06:07.319
TO COME UP WITH A MORE COST

04:06:07.385 --> 04:06:09.321
EFFECTIVE WAY. ON THE NEXT

04:06:09.387 --> 04:06:11.289
SLIDE, WHICH I KNOW THAT WE'LL

04:06:11.356 --> 04:06:13.291
HEAR MORE ABOUT FROM HAWAII, IS

04:06:13.358 --> 04:06:16.061
LEVERAGE EXISTING SYSTEMS. SO

04:06:16.128 --> 04:06:17.362
HAWAII'S APPROACH IS REALLY

04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:18.396
BRILLIANT ON HOW THEY'VE

04:06:18.463 --> 04:06:21.867
LEVERAGED AN EXISTING PROCESS.

04:06:21.933 --> 04:06:24.035
AND SO I KNOW MINDY WILL TALK

04:06:24.102 --> 04:06:25.337
MORE ABOUT THAT, BUT THAT'S A

04:06:25.403 --> 04:06:27.005
WAY FOR US ALL TO LEARN. WE'RE

04:06:27.072 --> 04:06:28.673
ALL LOOKING AT HAWAII, MINDY,

04:06:28.740 --> 04:06:30.242
TO FIGURE OUT IS THAT A COST

04:06:30.308 --> 04:06:31.109
EFFECTIVE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD

04:06:31.176 --> 04:06:33.078
DOWN A DISTANCE BASED PATH, IF

04:06:33.145 --> 04:06:35.313
WE SO CHOOSE? AND ANOTHER WAY,

04:06:35.380 --> 04:06:37.349
IN THE NEXT SLIDE, I'M LOOKING

04:06:37.415 --> 04:06:38.283
AT THAT LOWERING THE COST AGAIN

04:06:38.350 --> 04:06:39.985
IS VIRGINIA. I TALKED ABOUT

04:06:40.051 --> 04:06:42.721
VIRGINIA A LOT BECAUSE THEY ARE

04:06:42.787 --> 04:06:44.189
AN EASTERN STATE. BUT I THINK

04:06:44.256 --> 04:06:45.524
VIRGINIA HAS DONE A GREAT JOB,

04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:46.658
AND THEY'RE THE LARGEST PROGRAM

04:06:46.725 --> 04:06:47.993
IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY'VE

04:06:48.059 --> 04:06:50.362
REALLY COMMUNICATED WITH

04:06:50.428 --> 04:06:51.596
VIRGINIANS ABOUT WHY WOULD

04:06:51.663 --> 04:06:53.431
SOMEONE CHOOSE TO DO A DISTANCE

04:06:53.498 --> 04:06:55.467
BASED APPROACH VERSUS A FLAT

04:06:55.534 --> 04:06:57.869
FEE. SO AGAIN, THESE ARE WAYS

04:06:57.936 --> 04:07:00.172
THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS NEW

04:07:00.238 --> 04:07:02.440
WAY OF FUNDING TRANSPORTATION

04:07:02.507 --> 04:07:04.242
AND LOWER THAT ADMIN COSTS AND

04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:06.178
KIND OF BE SMARTER ABOUT HOW

04:07:06.244 --> 04:07:07.312
THAT FUTURE COULD LOOK LIKE.

04:07:07.379 --> 04:07:09.147
ALL RIGHT. SO MY LAST SLIDE

04:07:09.214 --> 04:07:10.849
HERE, I FELT A LITTLE BAD

04:07:10.916 --> 04:07:12.083
PUTTING THIS IN BECAUSE MY

04:07:12.150 --> 04:07:13.151
HUSBAND ACTUALLY HAD AN

04:07:13.218 --> 04:07:15.554
IMAGINARY FROG AS A FRIEND WHEN

04:07:15.620 --> 04:07:17.389
HE WAS A KID. I LOVE FROGS, BUT

04:07:17.455 --> 04:07:18.390
WE DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY BE

04:07:18.456 --> 04:07:20.091
A FROG. SO HEAR ME OUT. I KNOW

04:07:20.158 --> 04:07:22.227
IT'S A LITTLE LATE IN THE EAST

04:07:22.294 --> 04:07:23.562
COAST, BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T

04:07:23.628 --> 04:07:25.363
KNOW THAT WE HAVE THIS REVENUE

04:07:25.430 --> 04:07:26.164
PROBLEM, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW

04:07:26.231 --> 04:07:27.232
HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR

04:07:27.299 --> 04:07:28.833
TRANSPORTATION. WE'RE JUST

04:07:28.900 --> 04:07:30.268
SITTING HAPPY IN THIS KIND OF

04:07:30.335 --> 04:07:32.103
WARMISH WATER. BUT WE KNOW THE

04:07:32.170 --> 04:07:33.371
FOLKS IN THE ROOM, THE FOLKS

04:07:33.438 --> 04:07:35.207
YOU HAVE ON THIS ZOOM TODAY,

04:07:35.273 --> 04:07:37.242
THAT WE ARE FACING A REVENUE

04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:38.977
ISSUE, BUT IT'S SLOW. AND SO WE

04:07:39.044 --> 04:07:41.413
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

04:07:41.479 --> 04:07:42.380
KIND OF BRINGING UP AWARENESS

04:07:42.447 --> 04:07:43.615
ABOUT THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE

04:07:43.682 --> 04:07:45.450
FACING AND SOLUTIONS THAT WE

04:07:45.517 --> 04:07:46.952
CAN DO. SO WE DON'T SIT IN THAT

04:07:47.018 --> 04:07:49.020
POT OF WATER TOO LONG, SHALL WE

04:07:49.087 --> 04:07:50.689
SAY. ALL RIGHT. WITH THAT, I

04:07:50.755 --> 04:07:52.991
WILL PASS IT OVER BACK TO MADAM

04:07:53.058 --> 04:07:55.260
CHAIR. THANK YOU, DIRECTOR

04:07:55.327 --> 04:07:57.996
HENDREN. I APPRECIATE IT, AND I

04:07:58.063 --> 04:07:59.164
APPRECIATE THE ANALOGY AROUND

04:07:59.231 --> 04:08:00.865
THE FROG. AND YES, WE WANT TO

04:08:00.932 --> 04:08:03.168
PROTECT OUR BEAUTIFUL FROGS AND

04:08:03.235 --> 04:08:04.903
DON'T WANT TO BE A BOILED FROG.

04:08:04.970 --> 04:08:06.104
AND SO I'M GOING TO BRING IT

04:08:06.171 --> 04:08:08.173
BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY

04:08:08.240 --> 04:08:09.374
QUESTIONS. I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY

04:08:09.441 --> 04:08:10.175
MEMBER RANSOM HAD A QUESTION

04:08:10.242 --> 04:08:12.244
FOR OUR FIRST PANEL. I DO THANK

04:08:12.310 --> 04:08:14.012
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. FIRST OF ALL,

04:08:14.079 --> 04:08:16.114
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE

04:08:16.181 --> 04:08:17.315
PRESENTERS. IT'S BEEN A LONG

04:08:17.382 --> 04:08:19.417
DAY FOR ALL OF US, BUT THIS IS

04:08:19.484 --> 04:08:21.052
CLEARLY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

04:08:21.119 --> 04:08:22.954
SO I DEFINITELY HAVE CONCERNS.

04:08:23.021 --> 04:08:25.457
I'M GOING TO START WITH, I

04:08:25.523 --> 04:08:27.259
GUESS, QUESTIONS. AND REALLY I

04:08:27.325 --> 04:08:29.227
WANT TO KIND OF CHALLENGE SOME

04:08:29.294 --> 04:08:31.296
OF THE HYPOTHESIS AND, AND SEE

04:08:31.363 --> 04:08:33.164
IF YOU CAN HELP ME REALLY THINK

04:08:33.231 --> 04:08:35.066
THROUGH SOME OF THESE THINGS.

04:08:35.133 --> 04:08:37.235
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

04:08:37.302 --> 04:08:40.138
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED, I

04:08:40.205 --> 04:08:41.906
REPRESENT A COMMUNITY THAT'S

04:08:41.973 --> 04:08:44.075
NOT A RURAL COMMUNITY, BUT IT

04:08:44.142 --> 04:08:45.977
IS. WE HAVE OVER 100,000 OF MY

04:08:46.044 --> 04:08:47.979
CONSTITUENTS HAVE TO TRAVEL

04:08:48.046 --> 04:08:49.414
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAVELING TO

04:08:49.481 --> 04:08:50.982
WHERE THEIR JOBS ARE. THE

04:08:51.049 --> 04:08:52.183
HOUSING IS WHERE WE LIVE AND

04:08:52.250 --> 04:08:54.185
IT'S HOUSING THEY CAN AFFORD,

04:08:54.252 --> 04:08:55.987
RIGHT. SO THESE ARE NOT WEALTHY

04:08:56.054 --> 04:08:57.322
PEOPLE WHO JUST HAVE MONEY TO,

04:08:57.389 --> 04:08:59.891
YOU KNOW, GET ON THE FREEWAY

04:08:59.958 --> 04:09:02.060
AND TRAVEL. AND SO AS WE THINK

04:09:02.127 --> 04:09:04.929
ABOUT VEHICLE MILES TRAVEL, I'M

04:09:04.996 --> 04:09:07.198
JUST LOOKING FOR THE I

04:09:07.265 --> 04:09:09.000
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

04:09:09.067 --> 04:09:11.503
THAT, YOU KNOW, HEY, IT'S

04:09:11.569 --> 04:09:12.337
DIFFERENT BECAUSE DIFFERENT

04:09:12.404 --> 04:09:15.440
CARS OF DIFFERENT AGES, YOU

04:09:15.507 --> 04:09:17.242
KNOW, HAVE DIFFERENT GAS

04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:19.144
EFFICIENCY AND HOW THAT WOULD

04:09:19.210 --> 04:09:21.179
HELP. BUT THERE'S STILL GOING

04:09:21.246 --> 04:09:22.947
TO BE DRIVING THE SAME CARS

04:09:23.014 --> 04:09:24.249
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE PRICE OF

04:09:24.316 --> 04:09:25.950
CARS. AND EVS ARE MORE

04:09:26.017 --> 04:09:28.086
EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL CARS.

04:09:28.153 --> 04:09:30.255
SO I'M TRYING TO SEE HOW THIS

04:09:30.322 --> 04:09:31.089
IS FAIR, NOT JUST TO RURAL

04:09:31.156 --> 04:09:34.125
PEOPLE, BUT TO COMMUTERS WHO

04:09:34.192 --> 04:09:36.027
HOW HOW ARE WE? IF YOU CAN HELP

04:09:36.094 --> 04:09:38.763
ME UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WILL

04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:42.100
ACTUALLY RESULT IN LOWER, YOU

04:09:42.167 --> 04:09:44.235
KNOW, TAXES IF YOU WILL,

04:09:44.302 --> 04:09:46.404
BECAUSE IT'S STILL A TAX PAID

04:09:46.471 --> 04:09:48.907
FOR TRAVELING AND STILL BE ABLE

04:09:48.973 --> 04:09:53.945
TO BUILD THE REVENUE. YEAH. SO

04:09:54.012 --> 04:09:55.880
YEAH, I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT

04:09:55.947 --> 04:09:59.117
ONE. SO. THE ROAD USAGE CHARGES

04:09:59.184 --> 04:10:01.453
ARE MEANT TO BE KIND OF A

04:10:01.519 --> 04:10:02.320
REPLACEMENT FOR THE GAS TAX.

04:10:02.387 --> 04:10:07.192
AND ON AVERAGE YOUR DRIVER IS

04:10:07.258 --> 04:10:09.027
GOING TO BE PAYING THE SAME

04:10:09.094 --> 04:10:11.796
AMOUNT. RIGHT. IF WE'VE

04:10:11.863 --> 04:10:14.199
STRUCTURED THE MILEAGE FEE TO

04:10:14.265 --> 04:10:16.201
BASICALLY RAISE THE SAME AMOUNT

04:10:16.267 --> 04:10:17.502
OF REVENUE AS THE GAS TAX,

04:10:17.569 --> 04:10:19.104
WHERE IT STARTS TO GET

04:10:19.170 --> 04:10:21.373
DIFFERENT IS BASED ON THE FUEL

04:10:21.439 --> 04:10:23.074
EFFICIENCY OF THE VEHICLE. SO

04:10:23.141 --> 04:10:26.444
IF YOUR CAR TENDS TO BE MORE

04:10:26.511 --> 04:10:28.246
FUEL EFFICIENT THAN THE AVERAGE

04:10:28.313 --> 04:10:31.383
CAR, THEN YOU END UP PAYING

04:10:31.449 --> 04:10:33.318
MORE WITH THE ROAD USAGE CHARGE.

04:10:33.385 --> 04:10:35.053
BUT IF YOUR CAR IS LESS

04:10:35.120 --> 04:10:37.856
EFFICIENT ON AVERAGE THAN YOUR

04:10:37.922 --> 04:10:40.024
YOUR AVERAGE GAS CAR, THEN YOU

04:10:40.091 --> 04:10:42.127
END UP PAYING LESS. AND THE

04:10:42.193 --> 04:10:43.094
REASON RIGHT? SO THINK ABOUT IT

04:10:43.161 --> 04:10:47.565
THIS WAY. RIGHT. SO YOU HAVE

04:10:47.632 --> 04:10:49.000
LIKE A TOYOTA PRIUS AND LIKE A

04:10:49.067 --> 04:10:51.403
FORD F-150, RIGHT? SO THEY BOTH

04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:53.037
GO THE SAME DISTANCE. BUT WHICH

04:10:53.104 --> 04:10:55.106
ONE USES MORE GAS? THE THE FORD

04:10:55.173 --> 04:10:57.976
F-150. RIGHT. BECAUSE IT'S LESS

04:10:58.042 --> 04:10:59.210
FUEL EFFICIENT THAN THAN YOUR

04:10:59.277 --> 04:11:00.945
PRIUS AND BECAUSE BECAUSE IT

04:11:01.012 --> 04:11:04.249
USES MORE GAS THAT THAT VEHICLE

04:11:04.315 --> 04:11:06.985
WILL PAY MORE IN GAS TAXES.

04:11:07.051 --> 04:11:09.320
WHAT THE MILEAGE FEE DOES IS IT

04:11:09.387 --> 04:11:11.122
MAKES IT SO THAT THEY BOTH PAY

04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:13.358
THE SAME AMOUNT. SO THERE WILL

04:11:13.425 --> 04:11:15.126
BE WINNERS AND LOSERS. THERE'S

04:11:15.193 --> 04:11:17.262
NO WAY AROUND THAT. SOME PEOPLE

04:11:17.328 --> 04:11:18.430
WILL PAY MORE MONEY AND SOME

04:11:18.496 --> 04:11:20.465
PEOPLE WILL PAY LESS. AND THE

04:11:20.532 --> 04:11:22.700
GENERAL ANALYSIS THAT FOLKS ARE

04:11:22.767 --> 04:11:23.902
TALKING ABOUT IN RURAL

04:11:23.968 --> 04:11:26.237
COMMUNITIES, THEY IF YOU LOOK

04:11:26.304 --> 04:11:28.006
AT THE MATH, IT TURNS OUT THAT

04:11:28.072 --> 04:11:29.174
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO END UP

04:11:29.240 --> 04:11:31.209
PAYING A LITTLE BIT LESS. AND

04:11:31.276 --> 04:11:32.777
THEN WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE SOME

04:11:32.844 --> 04:11:33.344
WORK LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT

04:11:33.411 --> 04:11:35.713
LIKE LOWER INCOME AND

04:11:35.780 --> 04:11:37.248
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND

04:11:37.315 --> 04:11:40.452
THEY PAY A LITTLE BIT LESS, BUT

04:11:40.518 --> 04:11:41.986
NOT BUT NOT THAT MUCH IN

04:11:42.053 --> 04:11:44.322
COMPARISON TO RURAL COMMUNITIES.

04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:46.124
SO I'M STILL KIND OF WONDERING,

04:11:46.191 --> 04:11:48.126
SO WE STILL HAVE TO PUT GAS IN

04:11:48.193 --> 04:11:49.394
THE CAR. RIGHT. SO EVEN THOUGH

04:11:49.461 --> 04:11:51.095
THE GAS TAX IS LESS, YOU STILL

04:11:51.162 --> 04:11:53.631
HAVE TO PUT GAS IN THE CAR. AND

04:11:53.698 --> 04:11:54.933
THEN IN YOUR EXAMPLE OF THE

04:11:54.999 --> 04:11:56.367
PRIUS VERSUS THE F150, WELL,

04:11:56.434 --> 04:11:58.069
ONE, WE DON'T EVEN WANT YOU

04:11:58.136 --> 04:11:58.870
DRIVING AN OLD SCHOOL

04:11:58.937 --> 04:12:00.305
TRADITIONAL F-150, CAUSING ALL

04:12:00.371 --> 04:12:02.207
OF THESE OTHER ISSUES. AND SO

04:12:02.273 --> 04:12:03.875
YOU'RE STILL PUTTING GAS IN THE

04:12:03.942 --> 04:12:05.176
CAR. YOU'RE STILL GOING TO IF

04:12:05.243 --> 04:12:07.679
YOUR CAR IS LESS FUEL EFFICIENT,

04:12:07.745 --> 04:12:08.279
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO PAY MORE

04:12:08.346 --> 04:12:10.048
BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO PUT

04:12:10.114 --> 04:12:12.250
MORE GAS. AND THEN ON TOP OF IT,

04:12:12.317 --> 04:12:13.084
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS

04:12:13.151 --> 04:12:15.119
VEHICLE, MILES TRAVEL AND

04:12:15.186 --> 04:12:17.255
TAKING OUT RURAL AND TAKING OUT

04:12:17.322 --> 04:12:19.157
LOW INCOME. HOW IS THIS FAIR TO.

04:12:19.224 --> 04:12:21.359
AND I'M JUST JUST I DON'T KNOW

04:12:21.426 --> 04:12:22.927
THAT IT'S NOT FAIR. I'M JUST

04:12:22.994 --> 04:12:24.195
TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, WORK ON

04:12:24.262 --> 04:12:25.897
THIS TOGETHER. HOW IS THIS FAIR

04:12:25.964 --> 04:12:27.031
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LOW

04:12:27.098 --> 04:12:29.501
INCOME, NOT RURAL, WHO HAVE TO

04:12:29.567 --> 04:12:30.869
COMMUTE TO THEIR JOBS EVERY DAY

04:12:30.935 --> 04:12:33.204
PAYING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED?

04:12:33.271 --> 04:12:35.907
I'M JUST TRYING TO. BECAUSE YOU

04:12:35.974 --> 04:12:37.208
STILL HAVE TO PUT GAS IN THE

04:12:37.275 --> 04:12:39.210
CAR. YEAH, YEAH. SO SO THE

04:12:39.277 --> 04:12:40.278
IMPORTANT THING, THOUGH, IS

04:12:40.345 --> 04:12:43.381
THAT THIS WOULD YOU WOULDN'T BE

04:12:43.448 --> 04:12:45.283
DOUBLE PAYING. SO THIS WOULD

04:12:45.350 --> 04:12:47.418
REPLACE THE GAS TAX. SO YOU'RE

04:12:47.485 --> 04:12:48.319
STILL USING ALL THIS GAS BUT

04:12:48.386 --> 04:12:51.055
YOU, YOU WOULD NO LONGER PAY A

04:12:51.122 --> 04:12:52.323
GAS TAX AND INSTEAD YOU WOULD

04:12:52.390 --> 04:12:54.025
PAY THIS. USE THIS LIKE ROAD

04:12:54.092 --> 04:12:56.127
USAGE CHARGE OKAY I'M GOING TO

04:12:56.194 --> 04:12:57.362
MOVE ON. BUT I WANT YOU TO

04:12:57.428 --> 04:12:58.863
CONSIDER THE FACT THAT SOME

04:12:58.930 --> 04:13:01.332
PEOPLE, YES, YOU PAY FOR YOUR

04:13:01.399 --> 04:13:02.901
MILEAGE, BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO

04:13:02.967 --> 04:13:04.269
BUY MORE GAS BECAUSE YOU HAVE

04:13:04.335 --> 04:13:06.304
TO DRIVE FURTHER. SO WHILE IT'S

04:13:06.371 --> 04:13:07.939
NOT, YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY A

04:13:08.006 --> 04:13:10.174
TAX, IT'S STILL TAXING. I ALSO

04:13:10.241 --> 04:13:12.277
WONDER ABOUT OUR COMPETING

04:13:12.343 --> 04:13:14.178
PRIORITIES AND WHETHER WE'RE

04:13:14.245 --> 04:13:15.446
COMPETING AGAINST OURSELVES. SO

04:13:15.513 --> 04:13:18.383
IF YOU CAN ADDRESS HOW WE HAVE

04:13:18.449 --> 04:13:19.284
THINGS LIKE HIGH OCCUPANCY

04:13:19.350 --> 04:13:21.052
VEHICLE, YOU KNOW, DISCOUNTS

04:13:21.119 --> 04:13:23.488
WHERE PEOPLE ARE PILING UP IN A

04:13:23.555 --> 04:13:25.356
CAR, HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET

04:13:25.423 --> 04:13:27.091
THOSE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED?

04:13:27.158 --> 04:13:29.193
AND THEN WE HAVE PEOPLE

04:13:29.260 --> 04:13:30.028
TELECOMMUTING, YOU KNOW, WHICH

04:13:30.094 --> 04:13:31.262
ALSO DECLINES. SO WHEN I'M

04:13:31.329 --> 04:13:33.731
LOOKING AT THE DECLINE OF THE

04:13:33.798 --> 04:13:35.166
GASES AND THE GAS TAX, PART OF

04:13:35.233 --> 04:13:37.302
IT IS PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PAY

04:13:37.368 --> 04:13:38.903
MORE MONEY, SO THEY FIND OTHER

04:13:38.970 --> 04:13:41.139
WAYS. RIGHT. AND THE OTHER PART

04:13:41.205 --> 04:13:42.407
IS WE SAY PILE IN THE CAR

04:13:42.473 --> 04:13:44.342
TOGETHER AND WE'RE GOING TO LET

04:13:44.409 --> 04:13:46.144
YOU PASS BYPASS TRAFFIC. SO

04:13:46.210 --> 04:13:48.947
EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THAT HELPS.

04:13:49.013 --> 04:13:50.214
YEAH. WE'RE COMPETING AGAINST

04:13:50.281 --> 04:13:51.382
OURSELVES. YEAH. AND THAT'S

04:13:51.449 --> 04:13:53.017
GREAT. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE

04:13:53.084 --> 04:13:54.218
WANT RIGHT. IS WE WANT MORE

04:13:54.285 --> 04:13:56.487
CARPOOLING. WE WANT MORE

04:13:56.554 --> 04:13:58.156
TELECOMMUTING AND THOSE THINGS.

04:13:58.222 --> 04:14:00.391
SO I THINK THE DISTINCTION IS,

04:14:00.458 --> 04:14:02.460
YES, THOSE DO DETRACT FROM YOUR

04:14:02.527 --> 04:14:04.729
REVENUE. BUT ALSO YOU'RE USING

04:14:04.796 --> 04:14:07.332
THE ROADS LESS RIGHT, BECAUSE

04:14:07.398 --> 04:14:09.233
YOU'VE GOT FIVE PEOPLE IN ONE

04:14:09.300 --> 04:14:10.134
CAR INSTEAD OF FIVE DIFFERENT

04:14:10.201 --> 04:14:13.104
CARS THAT ARE DRIVING ON THE

04:14:13.171 --> 04:14:14.973
ROAD AND CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE

04:14:15.039 --> 04:14:18.109
ROADS. SO TO THE DEGREE THAT

04:14:18.176 --> 04:14:20.111
YOU ARE DECREASING THE AMOUNT

04:14:20.178 --> 04:14:22.180
THAT PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING ON

04:14:22.246 --> 04:14:24.515
THE ROADS, THAT SHOULD

04:14:24.582 --> 04:14:26.084
CORRESPOND TO LESS OF A

04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:29.287
NECESSITY TO FUND THE ROADS.

04:14:29.354 --> 04:14:32.256
AND SO I THINK THOSE, THOSE

04:14:32.323 --> 04:14:34.158
PARTICULAR ISSUES ARE MAYBE A

04:14:34.225 --> 04:14:36.894
LITTLE BIT SEPARATED FROM THE

04:14:36.961 --> 04:14:38.496
FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT THIS

04:14:38.563 --> 04:14:40.264
OVERALL SORT OF FUNDING

04:14:40.331 --> 04:14:42.367
DECREASE FROM FROM THE GAS. BUT,

04:14:42.433 --> 04:14:44.035
MADAM CHAIR, I APOLOGIZE.

04:14:44.102 --> 04:14:45.903
PLEASE GIVE ME A MOMENT, OKAY.

04:14:45.970 --> 04:14:47.205
BECAUSE I KIND OF WHAT YOU JUST

04:14:47.271 --> 04:14:49.207
SAID THAT WOULD, YOU KNOW,

04:14:49.273 --> 04:14:50.341
ELIMINATE OUR NEED TO FUND THE

04:14:50.408 --> 04:14:51.142
ROAD. THAT'S THE SAME THING

04:14:51.209 --> 04:14:52.310
THAT'S HAPPENING WITH PEOPLE

04:14:52.377 --> 04:14:54.145
CHOOSING NOT TO DRIVE, PEOPLE

04:14:54.212 --> 04:14:55.346
CHOOSING CARPOOLING. AND SO I,

04:14:55.413 --> 04:14:57.248
I JUST I GUESS I'M CONCERNED

04:14:57.315 --> 04:14:59.984
THAT I GUESS I NEED TO SEE

04:15:00.051 --> 04:15:02.053
WHERE THIS IS ACTUALLY

04:15:02.120 --> 04:15:03.321
BENEFITING PEOPLE IN THE SAME

04:15:03.388 --> 04:15:06.424
IN OTHER PLACES AND HOW THAT

04:15:06.491 --> 04:15:07.358
ACTUALLY WORKS, BECAUSE WE'RE

04:15:07.425 --> 04:15:09.027
SEEING A DECLINE IN GAS TAX

04:15:09.093 --> 04:15:10.161
BECAUSE LESS PEOPLE ARE

04:15:10.228 --> 04:15:12.196
CHOOSING TO PAY THE GAS TAX,

04:15:12.263 --> 04:15:13.431
IT'S BECAUSE GAS IS SO HIGH.

04:15:13.498 --> 04:15:14.899
THEY CHOOSE OTHER ALTERNATIVES

04:15:14.966 --> 04:15:16.300
OR THEY'RE HOV USERS. SO THAT

04:15:16.367 --> 04:15:18.302
THAT IS CONCERNING FOR ME. I

04:15:18.369 --> 04:15:21.139
ALSO WANT TO I GUESS MAYBE THIS

04:15:21.205 --> 04:15:24.075
MAY BE A QUESTION FOR OUR FIRST

04:15:24.142 --> 04:15:25.209
PRESENTER. WAS THAT ALLEN OR IS

04:15:25.276 --> 04:15:26.978
THAT ARE YOU ALLEN? ALLEN I'M

04:15:27.045 --> 04:15:28.212
ALLEN. YES, DOCTOR CHEN YOU'RE

04:15:28.279 --> 04:15:30.248
TALKING ABOUT DOUG SHINKLE. WHO

04:15:30.314 --> 04:15:32.283
I THINK HE'S STILL ON. OKAY, WE

04:15:32.350 --> 04:15:34.252
CAN CHECK. SO I'M JUST I'M JUST

04:15:34.318 --> 04:15:36.120
GOING TO GO QUICKLY BECAUSE I

04:15:36.187 --> 04:15:37.455
FEEL LIKE I'M MONOPOLIZING TIME.

04:15:37.522 --> 04:15:39.590
BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

04:15:39.657 --> 04:15:42.393
ELECTRIC, THE EXTRA FEES FOR AS

04:15:42.460 --> 04:15:43.861
ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES, KIND

04:15:43.928 --> 04:15:45.029
OF LIKE THESE EXTRA FEES THAT

04:15:45.096 --> 04:15:47.498
WOULD GO WITH EV VEHICLES. SO

04:15:47.565 --> 04:15:48.666
I'M JUST OPERATING IN THE

04:15:48.733 --> 04:15:50.001
SPIRIT OF FAIRNESS. RIGHT. AND

04:15:50.068 --> 04:15:52.704
WHEN WE THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES

04:15:52.770 --> 04:15:54.972
ALREADY COST MORE, THEY ALREADY

04:15:55.039 --> 04:15:57.208
IT'S IT'S IT'S INCONVENIENT AS

04:15:57.275 --> 04:15:58.943
IT IS TO TRY AND CHARGE AN

04:15:59.010 --> 04:16:00.378
ELECTRIC VEHICLE WHEN YOU'RE

04:16:00.445 --> 04:16:02.180
OUT. IT'S EXPENSIVE. I'M JUST

04:16:02.246 --> 04:16:05.483
TRYING TO TO SEE IN SOME OF THE

04:16:05.550 --> 04:16:06.250
ALTERNATIVES THAT YOU'VE SEEN.

04:16:06.317 --> 04:16:09.787
HOW HAS THE TRADE OFF BEEN

04:16:09.854 --> 04:16:12.056
ECONOMICALLY FAIR FOR FOLKS

04:16:12.123 --> 04:16:13.291
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING

04:16:13.357 --> 04:16:15.893
EXTRA FOR THE CAR TO BEGIN WITH?

04:16:15.960 --> 04:16:19.230
HOW IS THAT WORKING OUT? YEAH,

04:16:19.297 --> 04:16:21.032
I CAN SPEAK TO THAT. AND ALLEN

04:16:21.099 --> 04:16:23.234
AND DOCTOR JEN AND TRISH MAY BE

04:16:23.301 --> 04:16:25.002
ABLE TO WEIGH IN AS WELL. BUT A

04:16:25.069 --> 04:16:26.270
COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THERE. SO

04:16:26.337 --> 04:16:28.372
YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT SUPER WELL

04:16:28.439 --> 04:16:30.208
READ ON THE RESEARCH. BUT WHAT

04:16:30.274 --> 04:16:31.242
I DO KNOW IS THAT ELECTRIC

04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:33.277
VEHICLE OWNERS DO TEND TO HAVE

04:16:33.344 --> 04:16:36.047
MUCH HIGHER INCOMES. AND THEY

04:16:36.114 --> 04:16:37.281
ARE MAKING THE CHOICE TO

04:16:37.348 --> 04:16:38.883
PURCHASE THOSE VEHICLES. I

04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:40.551
THINK THERE ARE CERTAINLY

04:16:40.618 --> 04:16:42.353
EQUITY TRADE OFFS WITH ELECTRIC

04:16:42.420 --> 04:16:44.122
VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES, OR

04:16:44.188 --> 04:16:45.690
JUST ALTERNATIVE FUEL

04:16:45.757 --> 04:16:47.959
REGISTRATION FEES IN GENERAL,

04:16:48.025 --> 04:16:50.328
BECAUSE AS ALLEN SPOKE TO, THEY

04:16:50.394 --> 04:16:52.363
ARE NOT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE

04:16:52.430 --> 04:16:53.131
THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED TO USE IN

04:16:53.197 --> 04:16:55.299
ANY WAY. THEY'RE JUST FLAT. AND

04:16:55.366 --> 04:16:57.135
SO THAT DOES CREATE PROBLEMS

04:16:57.201 --> 04:17:00.671
WHEN YOU HAVE, SAY, SOMEONE.

04:17:00.738 --> 04:17:02.039
AND THE RESEARCH TENDS TO SHOW

04:17:02.106 --> 04:17:04.108
THAT PEOPLE THAT OWN ELECTRIC

04:17:04.175 --> 04:17:05.910
VEHICLES TEND TO DRIVE LESS IN

04:17:05.977 --> 04:17:08.679
GENERAL. NOW, THAT MAY CHANGE

04:17:08.746 --> 04:17:10.915
OVER TIME, BUT WHAT WE KNOW AS

04:17:10.982 --> 04:17:12.383
OF NOW IS THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLE

04:17:12.450 --> 04:17:14.685
OWNERS TEND TO DRIVE LESS AND

04:17:14.752 --> 04:17:15.653
SO THAT THEY'RE DRIVING LESS,

04:17:15.720 --> 04:17:17.221
BUT BECAUSE OF THESE FLAT

04:17:17.288 --> 04:17:19.357
REGISTRATION FEES, OR IN SOME

04:17:19.423 --> 04:17:21.025
CIRCUMSTANCES IN SOME STATES,

04:17:21.092 --> 04:17:22.894
PERHAPS PAYING MORE THERE THAN

04:17:22.960 --> 04:17:24.162
THEIR FAIR SHARE. THE FLIP SIDE

04:17:24.228 --> 04:17:26.397
IS THAT THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE,

04:17:26.464 --> 04:17:27.598
THAT THESE REGISTRATION FEES

04:17:27.665 --> 04:17:30.134
ARE INCREDIBLY SIMPLE AND COST

04:17:30.201 --> 04:17:32.336
EFFECTIVE TO IMPLEMENT, AND SO

04:17:32.403 --> 04:17:35.106
THAT THEY ARE A VERY EASY WAY

04:17:35.173 --> 04:17:36.974
FOR A STATE TO GET MONEY INTO

04:17:37.041 --> 04:17:39.210
THEIR SYSTEM QUICKLY. AND SO I

04:17:39.277 --> 04:17:41.279
THINK THAT'S ANOTHER DYNAMIC TO

04:17:41.345 --> 04:17:43.047
CONSIDER. BUT I'LL LET I'LL LET

04:17:43.114 --> 04:17:45.516
TRISH AND DOCTOR JEN WEIGH IN

04:17:45.583 --> 04:17:46.984
AS WELL. BEFORE YOU MOVE ON, I

04:17:47.051 --> 04:17:49.754
THINK IT'S ANOTHER QUESTION OF

04:17:49.821 --> 04:17:51.989
COMPETING, COMPETING AGAINST

04:17:52.056 --> 04:17:54.292
YOURSELF. AND SO I KNOW YOU

04:17:54.358 --> 04:17:55.960
MENTIONED THAT FOLKS WHO

04:17:56.027 --> 04:17:57.461
PURCHASE ELECTRIC VEHICLES MAY

04:17:57.528 --> 04:17:59.931
HAVE MORE INCOME, BUT AS WE ARE

04:17:59.997 --> 04:18:01.666
TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE

04:18:01.732 --> 04:18:04.235
AND TRANSITION INTO ELECTRIC

04:18:04.302 --> 04:18:06.037
VEHICLES AND AND THEN

04:18:06.103 --> 04:18:08.172
POTENTIALLY MAKING THEM MORE

04:18:08.239 --> 04:18:09.073
EXPENSIVE, ARE THERE CONCERNS

04:18:09.140 --> 04:18:11.676
THAT THIS MAY ACTUALLY

04:18:11.742 --> 04:18:13.945
DISINCENTIVIZE PEOPLE IN

04:18:14.011 --> 04:18:15.179
REGARDS TO PURCHASING THEM? AND

04:18:15.246 --> 04:18:16.981
THEN TO YOUR POINT ABOUT IT

04:18:17.048 --> 04:18:18.082
SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

04:18:18.149 --> 04:18:19.217
ELECTRIC VEHICLES TRAVEL LESS.

04:18:19.283 --> 04:18:21.285
IT'S MAY. IS IT RELATED TO THE

04:18:21.352 --> 04:18:22.920
FACT THAT YOU JUST CAN'T GO

04:18:22.987 --> 04:18:24.722
THAT FAR ON AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE?

04:18:24.789 --> 04:18:25.823
DO WE KNOW THE CORRELATION?

04:18:25.890 --> 04:18:28.092
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I WOULD

04:18:28.159 --> 04:18:30.261
GUESS THAT IS PART OF IT. I'M

04:18:30.328 --> 04:18:31.162
GOING TO GUESS ANOTHER PART,

04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:32.997
AND I'M GUESSING DOCTOR JEN AND

04:18:33.064 --> 04:18:34.198
TRISH MIGHT HAVE SOME INSIGHT

04:18:34.265 --> 04:18:35.433
ON THIS, BUT I'M GUESSING PART

04:18:35.499 --> 04:18:37.168
OF IT TOO IS BECAUSE ELECTRIC

04:18:37.235 --> 04:18:39.203
VEHICLE OWNERS TEND TO BE MORE

04:18:39.270 --> 04:18:40.171
AFFLUENT, WHICH MEANS THEY TEND

04:18:40.238 --> 04:18:42.640
TO BE A LITTLE BIT OLDER, WHICH

04:18:42.707 --> 04:18:44.342
MEANS THEY TEND TO BE MAYBE NOT

04:18:44.408 --> 04:18:46.210
IN THE JOB MARKET AND STUFF.

04:18:46.277 --> 04:18:48.646
AND THEY AND YES, BUT I WOULD

04:18:48.713 --> 04:18:50.014
GUESS THAT RANGE ANXIETY WOULD

04:18:50.081 --> 04:18:53.384
BE PART OF IT AS WELL. ASSEMBLY

04:18:53.451 --> 04:18:55.052
MEMBER I DO THINK THAT YOU HAVE

04:18:55.119 --> 04:18:57.154
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THAT

04:18:57.221 --> 04:18:58.155
THE TENSION HERE AND SOMETHING

04:18:58.222 --> 04:19:01.092
THAT I OFTEN TALK TO STATE

04:19:01.158 --> 04:19:01.926
LAWMAKERS FROM ACROSS THE

04:19:01.993 --> 04:19:04.128
COUNTRY, IS THAT IT IS REALLY

04:19:04.195 --> 04:19:07.498
IMPORTANT TO TRY AND MAKE THESE

04:19:07.565 --> 04:19:11.168
POLICY DECISIONS IN A KIND OF

04:19:11.235 --> 04:19:11.869
SYNERGISTIC, KIND OF

04:19:11.936 --> 04:19:16.240
COLLABORATIVE WAY. I, I ALWAYS

04:19:16.307 --> 04:19:18.342
PHRASE IT AS TRANSPORTATION

04:19:18.409 --> 04:19:20.945
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE TRYING TO

04:19:21.012 --> 04:19:24.448
DEAL WITH THE NEGATIVE

04:19:24.515 --> 04:19:27.018
REPERCUSSIONS OF ELECTRIC

04:19:27.084 --> 04:19:28.419
VEHICLES. NOW, LET'S START WITH

04:19:28.486 --> 04:19:30.121
THE POSITIVE. WHY, WHY, WHY ARE

04:19:30.187 --> 04:19:31.422
ELECTRIC VEHICLES SOMETHING

04:19:31.489 --> 04:19:33.524
THAT THE NATION HAS AND, YOU

04:19:33.591 --> 04:19:34.392
KNOW, AT SOMETIMES AND IN

04:19:34.458 --> 04:19:38.129
STATES HAVE INCENTIVIZE. IT'S

04:19:38.195 --> 04:19:41.032
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO REDUCE

04:19:41.098 --> 04:19:43.267
EMISSIONS. AND SO THAT'S THE

04:19:43.334 --> 04:19:45.002
POSITIVE RIGHT. THAT'S THE

04:19:45.069 --> 04:19:46.871
BENEFIT OF HAVING ELECTRIC

04:19:46.938 --> 04:19:50.074
VEHICLES. THAT IS MORE A AN

04:19:50.141 --> 04:19:52.944
ISSUE THAT IS OF THE

04:19:53.010 --> 04:19:55.680
JURISDICTION OF AN ENVIRONMENT

04:19:55.746 --> 04:19:57.648
OR AN ENERGY COMMITTEE IN A

04:19:57.715 --> 04:20:00.217
RESPECTIVE STATE, WHEREAS THE

04:20:00.284 --> 04:20:02.019
FOLKS ON A COMMITTEE SUCH AS

04:20:02.086 --> 04:20:03.354
YOURS, AND OF COURSE, VERY MUCH

04:20:03.421 --> 04:20:05.022
DEPENDS ON THE STATE, THEY'RE

04:20:05.089 --> 04:20:07.158
MORE FOCUSED ON THE NEGATIVE

04:20:07.224 --> 04:20:08.259
REPERCUSSIONS OF ELECTRIC

04:20:08.326 --> 04:20:09.894
VEHICLES, I.E. THEY ARE

04:20:09.961 --> 04:20:13.097
DESTROYING THE MAIN BASE OF

04:20:13.164 --> 04:20:15.399
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THAT

04:20:15.466 --> 04:20:17.702
EXISTS FOR THAT, THAT STATES

04:20:17.768 --> 04:20:20.271
ARE RELYING ON. SO I THINK THAT

04:20:20.338 --> 04:20:23.307
I DON'T HAVE AN EASY ANSWER. NO

04:20:23.374 --> 04:20:24.976
STATE HAS AN EASY ANSWER. BUT I

04:20:25.042 --> 04:20:26.344
DO THINK THAT YOU NEED TO THINK

04:20:26.410 --> 04:20:27.878
ABOUT THIS IN CONCERT AND

04:20:27.945 --> 04:20:29.113
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THIS IS WHY

04:20:29.180 --> 04:20:31.115
WE'VE SEEN AS AND YOU'LL NOTE

04:20:31.182 --> 04:20:31.916
THAT, YOU KNOW, COLORADO AND

04:20:31.983 --> 04:20:33.150
HAWAII ARE TWO THE STATES WITH

04:20:33.217 --> 04:20:35.119
THE LOWEST ELECTRIC VEHICLE

04:20:35.186 --> 04:20:36.320
REGISTRATION FEES. THEY ARE

04:20:36.387 --> 04:20:37.989
ALSO TWO OF THE STATES THAT ARE

04:20:38.055 --> 04:20:39.190
MORE AGGRESSIVE IN TRYING TO

04:20:39.256 --> 04:20:41.959
GET RID OF EMISSIONS IN THEIR

04:20:42.026 --> 04:20:44.061
STATES. AND SO THAT IS AN

04:20:44.128 --> 04:20:45.229
INTENTIONAL CHOICE THAT THEY

04:20:45.296 --> 04:20:47.298
HAVE BEEN LESS RELIANT ON

04:20:47.365 --> 04:20:48.032
ELECTRIC VEHICLE REGISTRATION

04:20:48.099 --> 04:20:50.234
FEES, BECAUSE THE STRATEGY AND

04:20:50.301 --> 04:20:52.336
THE POLICY APPROACH IN THEIR

04:20:52.403 --> 04:20:54.905
STATES IS MORE FOCUSED ON

04:20:54.972 --> 04:20:57.508
DECREASING EMISSIONS AND NOT AS

04:20:57.575 --> 04:21:01.412
FOCUSED ON RAISING REVENUE, IF

04:21:01.479 --> 04:21:02.947
THAT MAKES SENSE. IT DOES.

04:21:03.014 --> 04:21:05.149
THANK YOU FOR THAT. GO AHEAD.

04:21:05.216 --> 04:21:07.718
SORRY, I MAY JUMP IN REALLY

04:21:07.785 --> 04:21:09.253
BRIEFLY. I THINK THE A

04:21:09.320 --> 04:21:11.055
REASSURING FINDING FROM THE

04:21:11.122 --> 04:21:12.990
RESEARCH IS THAT THESE ANNUAL

04:21:13.057 --> 04:21:15.126
EV FEES HAVE NOT BEEN A

04:21:15.192 --> 04:21:18.262
DETERRENT TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS

04:21:18.329 --> 04:21:21.899
PURCHASE EVS. SO I HEAR

04:21:21.966 --> 04:21:23.134
SOMEBODY REMEMBER THAT CONFLICT,

04:21:23.200 --> 04:21:26.203
WHICH IS IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANT

04:21:26.270 --> 04:21:27.038
TO PROMOTE THE ADOPTION OF EVS.

04:21:27.104 --> 04:21:29.407
SO WHY WOULD WE THEN TURN

04:21:29.473 --> 04:21:31.809
AROUND AND CHARGE EVS

04:21:31.876 --> 04:21:34.111
ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN THAT

04:21:34.178 --> 04:21:36.280
DE-INCENTIVIZE THEM? SO I THINK

04:21:36.347 --> 04:21:37.081
A REASSURING FINDINGS FROM

04:21:37.148 --> 04:21:39.183
AROUND THE COUNTRY IS THAT'S

04:21:39.250 --> 04:21:40.484
NOT TRUE. AND YOU MAY THINK,

04:21:40.551 --> 04:21:43.721
WELL, WHY NOT? AND IT REALLY

04:21:43.788 --> 04:21:45.056
COMES DOWN TO THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

04:21:45.122 --> 04:21:47.091
THAT PEOPLE ARE SPENDING ON

04:21:47.158 --> 04:21:48.993
FUEL TAX OR ON AN EV FEE IS

04:21:49.060 --> 04:21:51.128
SUCH A SMALL PORTION OF EITHER

04:21:51.195 --> 04:21:52.863
THE PURCHASE OF THE VEHICLE

04:21:52.930 --> 04:21:55.032
COSTS THE FUEL, WHETHER IT BE

04:21:55.099 --> 04:21:56.767
ENERGY OR ACTUAL GASOLINE OR

04:21:56.834 --> 04:21:58.002
DIESEL, TO MOVE THAT VEHICLE

04:21:58.069 --> 04:21:59.270
AROUND. MAINTENANCE COSTS

04:21:59.336 --> 04:22:01.172
EVERYTHING. SO I THINK AS

04:22:01.238 --> 04:22:05.209
YOU'RE IN A NOT A VERY A TOUGH

04:22:05.276 --> 04:22:08.412
POSITION TO TRY TO FIND A WAY,

04:22:08.479 --> 04:22:10.247
A POLICY APPROACH THAT ADHERES

04:22:10.314 --> 04:22:12.383
TO WHAT CALIFORNIA WANTS TO DO,

04:22:12.450 --> 04:22:14.452
BUT THEN ALSO ENSURES THAT YOU

04:22:14.518 --> 04:22:16.320
HAVE A RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE

04:22:16.387 --> 04:22:18.155
AND THE FUEL TAX IS JUST NOT

04:22:18.222 --> 04:22:20.357
GOING TO BE IT. AND FLAT

04:22:20.424 --> 04:22:22.159
REGISTRATION FEES. EVENTUALLY

04:22:22.226 --> 04:22:24.361
THE PUBLIC WILL, I THINK, PUSH

04:22:24.428 --> 04:22:26.297
BACK ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST

04:22:26.363 --> 04:22:28.365
NOT FAIR. SO WHAT I THINK FROM

04:22:28.432 --> 04:22:30.334
SOME OF THE OTHER STATES YOU'LL

04:22:30.401 --> 04:22:32.103
HEAR FROM, THERE ARE SOME KIND

04:22:32.169 --> 04:22:34.004
OF MIXED APPROACHES TO ADDRESS

04:22:34.071 --> 04:22:36.107
THAT WE WANT TO. AND I THINK

04:22:36.173 --> 04:22:37.475
THIS IS A CHOICE PRESERVE THAT

04:22:37.541 --> 04:22:40.010
USER PAY PRINCIPLE. SO ALAN HAD

04:22:40.077 --> 04:22:41.145
MENTIONED WE COULD GO TO A

04:22:41.212 --> 04:22:43.214
GENERAL FUND APPROACH FOR

04:22:43.280 --> 04:22:43.914
TRANSPORTATION THAT STRIKES

04:22:43.981 --> 04:22:46.117
UTTER FEAR INTO MY HEART. AND I

04:22:46.183 --> 04:22:47.785
WOULD THINK AS AN ELECTED

04:22:47.852 --> 04:22:49.220
OFFICIAL, WITH ALL THE

04:22:49.286 --> 04:22:50.354
CHALLENGES AND DEMANDS ON THE

04:22:50.421 --> 04:22:53.557
PURSE OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATION,

04:22:53.624 --> 04:22:55.593
FOR DOCTORS, FOR EMERGENCY

04:22:55.659 --> 04:22:57.628
RESPONDERS, YOU NAME IT. IF WE

04:22:57.695 --> 04:22:59.029
HAD TRANSPORTATION IN THERE, I

04:22:59.096 --> 04:23:00.097
THINK IT WILL BE VERY

04:23:00.164 --> 04:23:01.365
CHALLENGING TO KEEP OUR ROADS

04:23:01.432 --> 04:23:03.968
GOING. SO WE'RE JUST WE'RE

04:23:04.034 --> 04:23:06.871
WE'RE WE DON'T PLAY AS WELL OR

04:23:06.937 --> 04:23:09.006
AGAINST SCHOOLS. AND I'M BEING

04:23:09.073 --> 04:23:10.207
VERY BLUNT, MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S

04:23:10.274 --> 04:23:11.909
LATE IN THE EVENING AND ON THE

04:23:11.976 --> 04:23:13.043
EAST COAST. BUT WHAT IS

04:23:13.110 --> 04:23:14.645
PRESERVED ARE, YOU KNOW, VERY

04:23:14.712 --> 04:23:16.413
STRONG TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN

04:23:16.480 --> 04:23:18.215
OUR COUNTRY. IS THAT PROTECTED

04:23:18.282 --> 04:23:20.351
USER PAY PRINCIPLE. AND THAT'S

04:23:20.417 --> 04:23:21.085
THE CROSSROAD WE'RE AT RIGHT

04:23:21.152 --> 04:23:23.254
NOW. SO I JUST WANT TO GO BACK

04:23:23.320 --> 04:23:24.989
AND MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT. I'LL

04:23:25.055 --> 04:23:26.223
STOP WHEN YOU'RE ASKING FOR

04:23:26.290 --> 04:23:27.358
THOSE COMMUTERS THAT ARE

04:23:27.424 --> 04:23:29.260
DRIVING FARTHER TO GET TO WORK.

04:23:29.326 --> 04:23:31.162
I THINK THE FRANK ANSWER IS

04:23:31.228 --> 04:23:33.197
THEY MAY HAVE TO PAY MORE

04:23:33.264 --> 04:23:34.698
BECAUSE THEY ARE DRIVING A

04:23:34.765 --> 04:23:36.066
LONGER DISTANCE, BUT THEY'RE

04:23:36.133 --> 04:23:37.334
PAYING MORE NOW AND THEY FEEL

04:23:37.401 --> 04:23:39.003
THAT THEY ARE BUYING. SO WE

04:23:39.069 --> 04:23:41.839
JUST NEED TO DECIDE, ARE WE

04:23:41.906 --> 04:23:43.374
GOING TO RETIE USING THE ROAD

04:23:43.440 --> 04:23:46.177
TO PAYING FOR IT BY THE MILE,

04:23:46.243 --> 04:23:47.044
WHICH IT HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN?

04:23:47.111 --> 04:23:49.013
HENCE REASON WHY I BROUGHT US

04:23:49.079 --> 04:23:51.282
ALL BACK TO 1919, IN MY SLIDE.

04:23:51.348 --> 04:23:52.950
OKAY, I'LL STOP THERE. BUT I

04:23:53.017 --> 04:23:54.251
DECIDED TO TO RESPOND. THANK

04:23:54.318 --> 04:23:58.189
YOU ALL. OKAY, I THINK ASSEMBLY

04:23:58.255 --> 04:24:00.257
MEMBER LACKEY, DID YOU HAVE A

04:24:00.324 --> 04:24:02.059
QUESTION OR FOR THIS PANEL

04:24:02.126 --> 04:24:04.195
BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR OUR

04:24:04.261 --> 04:24:06.931
PILOTS? I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION.

04:24:06.997 --> 04:24:09.200
I HAVE SOME THINGS I WANT TO

04:24:09.266 --> 04:24:10.034
SAY THAT I THINK ARE VERY

04:24:10.100 --> 04:24:13.504
COGENT TO OUR DISCUSSION. FIRST

04:24:13.571 --> 04:24:15.940
OF ALL, IN THE HEARING, WE'RE

04:24:16.006 --> 04:24:17.308
HEARING ABOUT ALTERNATIVES TO

04:24:17.374 --> 04:24:19.944
THE GAS TAX. BUT I THINK WE

04:24:20.010 --> 04:24:21.245
NEED TO BE CLEAR WHAT WE'RE

04:24:21.312 --> 04:24:22.780
REALLY TALKING ABOUT, WHETHER

04:24:22.846 --> 04:24:24.481
IT'S A ROAD CHARGE OR A HIGHWAY

04:24:24.548 --> 04:24:27.251
FEE OR A MILEAGE FEE, WE'RE

04:24:27.318 --> 04:24:28.319
TALKING ABOUT IMPOSING A BRAND

04:24:28.385 --> 04:24:31.188
NEW TAX ON OUR DRIVERS FOR

04:24:31.255 --> 04:24:34.358
EVERY MILE THEY DRIVE. AND

04:24:34.425 --> 04:24:36.260
WHILE THIS NEW TAX IS PITCHED

04:24:36.327 --> 04:24:38.128
AS A REPLACEMENT OR ALTERNATIVE

04:24:38.195 --> 04:24:40.698
TO THE GAS TAX, I DON'T THINK

04:24:40.764 --> 04:24:44.735
THAT'S A REALITY HERE, I THINK

04:24:44.802 --> 04:24:47.071
TRUTHFULLY, NOBODY INVOLVED IN

04:24:47.137 --> 04:24:49.506
SHAPING THIS THIS PROPOSAL,

04:24:49.573 --> 04:24:51.375
NEITHER THE ADMINISTRATION OR

04:24:51.442 --> 04:24:53.544
THE SUPERMAJORITY, WILL COMMIT

04:24:53.611 --> 04:24:56.981
TO REPEALING THE GAS TAX. THAT

04:24:57.047 --> 04:24:58.949
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I DO

04:24:59.016 --> 04:25:02.119
NOT BELIEVE THAT UNLESS THE GAS

04:25:02.186 --> 04:25:04.154
TAX IS ACTUALLY REPEALED, WE'RE

04:25:04.221 --> 04:25:07.157
TALKING ABOUT A SECOND TAX. AND

04:25:07.224 --> 04:25:08.859
CALIFORNIANS ALREADY PAY THE

04:25:08.926 --> 04:25:11.061
HIGHEST GAS TAX AND GAS PRICES

04:25:11.128 --> 04:25:13.264
IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

04:25:13.330 --> 04:25:15.132
CALIFORNIA'S GAS PRICES ARE

04:25:15.199 --> 04:25:17.201
CURRENTLY ABOUT $1.40 ABOVE THE

04:25:17.268 --> 04:25:19.069
NATIONAL AVERAGE, AND THE COST

04:25:19.136 --> 04:25:21.338
OF GAS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

04:25:21.405 --> 04:25:23.307
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES FACING OUR

04:25:23.374 --> 04:25:25.209
CONSTITUENTS, ACCORDING TO THE

04:25:25.276 --> 04:25:27.311
US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.

04:25:27.378 --> 04:25:29.079
CALIFORNIANS SPEND MORE ON

04:25:29.146 --> 04:25:31.248
TRANSPORTATION COSTS THAN ANY

04:25:31.315 --> 04:25:33.117
OTHER HOUSEHOLD EXPENSE, EXCEPT

04:25:33.183 --> 04:25:35.586
FOR HOUSING ITSELF. OUR

04:25:35.653 --> 04:25:37.788
CONSTITUENTS ARE STRUGGLING

04:25:37.855 --> 04:25:39.223
WITH AFFORDABILITY. NOW IS NOT

04:25:39.290 --> 04:25:41.025
THE TIME TO CONSIDER A NEW TAX

04:25:41.091 --> 04:25:44.161
ON DRIVERS. THAT MAKES

04:25:44.228 --> 04:25:44.895
TRANSPORTATION EVEN MORE

04:25:44.962 --> 04:25:48.732
EXPENSIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR THE

04:25:48.799 --> 04:25:52.102
LOW INCOME DRIVERS. MY DISTRICT,

04:25:52.169 --> 04:25:54.471
SIMILAR TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM

04:25:54.538 --> 04:25:58.842
STOCKTON, HAVE A MAJORITY OF

04:25:58.909 --> 04:25:59.977
COMMUTE. THAT'S OUT OF

04:26:00.044 --> 04:26:02.846
NECESSITY. THEY DRIVE. IN MY

04:26:02.913 --> 04:26:05.182
DISTRICT, THE AVERAGE COMMUTE

04:26:05.249 --> 04:26:08.585
IS ABOUT 100 MILES AND THEIR

04:26:08.652 --> 04:26:11.121
AVERAGE VEHICLE WORTH IS ABOUT

04:26:11.188 --> 04:26:13.490
$5,000. SO TO TO THE POINT

04:26:13.557 --> 04:26:15.893
ABOUT FUEL EFFICIENCY, THAT'S A

04:26:15.959 --> 04:26:19.129
CONSIDERABLE THING. AND I

04:26:19.196 --> 04:26:20.864
ACTUALLY SHARE THE CONCERN

04:26:20.931 --> 04:26:21.999
RAISED ABOUT THE DECLINING

04:26:22.066 --> 04:26:25.235
REVENUE FOR ROADS. BUT MUCH OF

04:26:25.302 --> 04:26:26.103
THIS DECLINE WILL BE CAUSED BY

04:26:26.170 --> 04:26:28.105
OWNERS OF ZERO EMISSION

04:26:28.172 --> 04:26:29.406
VEHICLES, AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING

04:26:29.473 --> 04:26:31.175
ABOUT. AND THEY PAY ZERO ZERO

04:26:31.241 --> 04:26:34.211
AT THIS POINT. AND CALIFORNIA'S

04:26:34.278 --> 04:26:36.347
REVENUE DECLINE WILL BE MORE

04:26:36.413 --> 04:26:38.849
DRAMATICALLY DUE TO POLICY

04:26:38.916 --> 04:26:40.417
CHOICES HERE. THAT'S IN OUR

04:26:40.484 --> 04:26:42.186
HANDS. AND ACCORDING TO UC

04:26:42.252 --> 04:26:43.821
DAVIS INSTITUTE OF

04:26:43.887 --> 04:26:46.056
TRANSPORTATION STUDIES, I THINK

04:26:46.123 --> 04:26:47.358
WE HAD ANOTHER PERSON HERE FROM

04:26:47.424 --> 04:26:51.862
UC DAVIS. THE ANALYSIS OF ZERO

04:26:51.929 --> 04:26:53.097
EMISSION VEHICLE BUYERS IN

04:26:53.163 --> 04:26:55.299
CALIFORNIA. GET A LOAD OF THIS.

04:26:55.366 --> 04:26:58.736
THEY HAVE A MEAN INCOME OF

04:26:58.802 --> 04:27:01.071
$190,000 A YEAR. THE AVERAGE

04:27:01.138 --> 04:27:04.875
INCOME IN MY DISTRICT IS 45,000.

04:27:04.942 --> 04:27:08.112
81% OF THESE ZEV OWNERS ARE

04:27:08.178 --> 04:27:11.014
HOMEOWNERS AND NOT RENTERS. 81%

04:27:11.081 --> 04:27:14.218
OF THEM ARE ALSO COLLEGE

04:27:14.284 --> 04:27:16.019
GRADUATES. WHILE THERE'S HOPE

04:27:16.086 --> 04:27:17.421
THAT THIS COULD CHANGE SOMEDAY

04:27:17.488 --> 04:27:20.090
IN THE FUTURE, A RECENT STUDY

04:27:20.157 --> 04:27:22.126
FROM THE UCLA LUSKIN CENTER

04:27:22.192 --> 04:27:23.394
CONCLUDED THAT EVEN IN THE MOST

04:27:23.460 --> 04:27:25.229
OPTIMISTIC CASES, IT APPEARS

04:27:25.295 --> 04:27:27.531
THAT CALIFORNIA'S MOST

04:27:27.598 --> 04:27:28.132
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WILL

04:27:28.198 --> 04:27:31.135
REMAIN FAR BEHIND IN CLEAN

04:27:31.201 --> 04:27:33.337
VEHICLE ACCESS. THIS IS WHY

04:27:33.404 --> 04:27:35.038
PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE HEARING

04:27:35.105 --> 04:27:36.840
ABOUT TODAY AND OTHER STATES

04:27:36.907 --> 04:27:39.009
FOCUS MOST MOSTLY EXCLUSIVELY

04:27:39.076 --> 04:27:41.078
ON ZEV OWNERS. CALIFORNIA

04:27:41.145 --> 04:27:42.980
SHOULD DO THIS AS WELL. WE

04:27:43.046 --> 04:27:44.648
SHOULD NOT IMPOSE A SECOND

04:27:44.715 --> 04:27:45.916
REGRESSIVE TAX ON LOW INCOME

04:27:45.983 --> 04:27:47.251
AND MIDDLE CLASS DRIVERS, WHO

04:27:47.317 --> 04:27:49.186
ALREADY PAY A DISPROPORTIONATE

04:27:49.253 --> 04:27:52.189
SHARE OF THEIR SHARE OF THE

04:27:52.256 --> 04:27:55.592
FUNDS TO OUR ROADS. AND THAT'S

04:27:55.659 --> 04:27:57.795
REALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK

04:27:57.861 --> 04:27:59.897
YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I

04:27:59.963 --> 04:28:01.198
APPRECIATE THEM AND YOUR

04:28:01.265 --> 04:28:03.333
CONCERN. I THINK WE ALL SHARED

04:28:03.400 --> 04:28:06.136
THEM AS EVIDENCED BY MY

04:28:06.203 --> 04:28:07.371
COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON WHO

04:28:07.438 --> 04:28:09.106
NOTED SOME OF THE SAME. AND

04:28:09.173 --> 04:28:11.208
THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY,

04:28:11.275 --> 04:28:14.211
RIGHT? WE ARE HERE TO LOOK AT

04:28:14.278 --> 04:28:15.345
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES AS

04:28:15.412 --> 04:28:17.214
WE LOOK AT A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

04:28:17.281 --> 04:28:19.082
AS IT RELATES TO OUR

04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:20.184
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, OUR

04:28:20.250 --> 04:28:21.919
NETWORK OF HIGHWAYS AND ROADS,

04:28:21.985 --> 04:28:24.087
DEALING WITH POTHOLES AND

04:28:24.154 --> 04:28:26.223
ENSURING PEOPLE HAVE SAFE,

04:28:26.290 --> 04:28:28.058
RELIABLE WAYS TO MOVE IN AND

04:28:28.125 --> 04:28:30.294
AROUND OUR STATE. AND THAT

04:28:30.360 --> 04:28:32.029
REALLY, OUR TRANSPORTATION

04:28:32.095 --> 04:28:34.598
SYSTEM MATCHES THE FACT THAT WE

04:28:34.665 --> 04:28:37.501
ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY

04:28:37.568 --> 04:28:41.071
IN IN THE WORLD. AND SO THAT IS

04:28:41.138 --> 04:28:42.272
WHAT THE POINT OF THIS

04:28:42.339 --> 04:28:44.341
CONVERSATION IS. THERE IS NO

04:28:44.408 --> 04:28:47.077
PROPOSAL YET. BUT THROUGH THESE

04:28:47.144 --> 04:28:49.012
SERIES OF HEARINGS, AS WELL AS

04:28:49.079 --> 04:28:51.215
OUR TOWN HALLS, WE WILL GET TO

04:28:51.281 --> 04:28:53.450
WHERE WE HAVE SOME TYPE OF

04:28:53.517 --> 04:28:55.586
PROPOSAL BEFORE THE LEGISLATIVE

04:28:55.652 --> 04:28:57.187
BODY TO CONSIDER. I'D LIKE TO

04:28:57.254 --> 04:28:59.022
NOW INVITE OUR SECOND PANEL.

04:28:59.089 --> 04:29:01.124
THIS SUBJECT OF THIS PANEL IS

04:29:01.191 --> 04:29:02.059
THIS IS OUR SECOND AND FINAL

04:29:02.125 --> 04:29:05.229
PANEL IS OUR OTHER STATE'S

04:29:05.295 --> 04:29:07.097
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION

04:29:07.164 --> 04:29:09.066
FUNDING MECHANISM. I THANK THEM

04:29:09.132 --> 04:29:10.300
FOR THEIR PATIENCE. THEY HAVE

04:29:10.367 --> 04:29:13.570
HELD ON ALL DAY LONG. WE HAD A

04:29:13.637 --> 04:29:15.572
MUCH LONGER SESSION THAN HAD

04:29:15.639 --> 04:29:17.074
INTENDED, AND SO I JUST

04:29:17.140 --> 04:29:18.242
APPRECIATE THEM FOR MAKING

04:29:18.308 --> 04:29:19.877
THEMSELVES AVAILABLE. AND

04:29:19.943 --> 04:29:21.545
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE LOST QUITE A

04:29:21.612 --> 04:29:23.514
FEW OF OUR MEMBERS, THIS WILL

04:29:23.580 --> 04:29:26.083
BE MEMORIALIZED VIA VIDEO AND

04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:27.351
SO THEY'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

04:29:27.417 --> 04:29:29.186
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE

04:29:29.253 --> 04:29:29.987
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS.

04:29:30.053 --> 04:29:32.089
AND THIS WILL BE PART OF THE

04:29:32.155 --> 04:29:34.024
RECORD AS IT RELATES TO LOOKING

04:29:34.091 --> 04:29:36.059
AT WAYS TO SUSTAIN OUR

04:29:36.126 --> 04:29:37.261
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. I'LL

04:29:37.327 --> 04:29:39.196

04:29:39.263 --> 04:29:41.198

NAME THEM OFF AND I WILL HOLD

04:29:42.966 --> 04:29:44.067
INTRODUCTIONS, AND THEN WE'LL

04:29:44.134 --> 04:29:45.269
HAVE IT AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS

04:29:45.335 --> 04:29:47.070
AT THE END. SO WE HAVE MINDY

04:29:47.137 --> 04:29:50.040

NIKKI MOORE, AND I'M THE HAWAII

04:31:11.355 --> 04:31:12.889
ROAD USAGE CHARGE PROGRAM

04:31:12.956 --> 04:31:13.991

SO TODAY I'LL BE TALKING A

04:31:17.160 --> 04:31:18.996
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HAWAII

04:31:19.062 --> 04:31:20.130
ROAD USAGE CHARGE PROGRAM,

04:31:20.197 --> 04:31:22.032
WHICH WE'VE JUST LAUNCHED OUR

04:31:22.099 --> 04:31:23.066
IMPLEMENTATION ON JULY 1ST OF

04:31:23.133 --> 04:31:26.203
THIS YEAR. SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:28.472
SO AS THE PREVIOUS PANEL

04:31:28.538 --> 04:31:30.574
MEMBERS HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE,

04:31:30.641 --> 04:31:33.143
A ROAD USER CHARGE AGAIN IS A

04:31:33.210 --> 04:31:34.344
CONSUMPTION CHARGE THAT

04:31:34.411 --> 04:31:36.346
ASSESSES THE PER MILE FEE ON A

04:31:36.413 --> 04:31:37.280
DRIVER BASED ON HOW MANY MILES

04:31:37.347 --> 04:31:39.850
THAT THEY DRIVE DURING A

04:31:39.916 --> 04:31:41.618
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. IT DOES

04:31:41.685 --> 04:31:43.120
THREE THINGS. IT EMPLOYS THE

04:31:43.186 --> 04:31:44.388
USER PAYS PRINCIPLE. IT ENSURES

04:31:44.454 --> 04:31:46.456
THAT EVERYONE PAYS FOR THE FAIR

04:31:46.523 --> 04:31:48.058
USE OF THE SYSTEM, AND IT

04:31:48.125 --> 04:31:50.027
PROVIDES SUSTAINABLE, LONG TERM

04:31:50.093 --> 04:31:51.228
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. AS YOU

04:31:51.294 --> 04:31:53.063
CAN SEE IN THIS GRAPH, THE THE

04:31:53.130 --> 04:31:55.198
LIGHT BARS. LIGHT GREEN BARS

04:31:55.265 --> 04:31:57.234
SHOW THE DISPARITY OF THE FUEL

04:31:57.300 --> 04:31:58.502
TAX BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES

04:31:58.568 --> 04:32:00.137
OF VEHICLES. BUT WITH THE ROAD

04:32:00.203 --> 04:32:01.838
USAGE CHARGE SHOWN IN THE DARK

04:32:01.905 --> 04:32:03.206
GREEN, A DRIVER WOULD PAY BASED

04:32:03.273 --> 04:32:05.175
ON THE NUMBER OF MILES THAT

04:32:05.242 --> 04:32:06.910
THEY DRIVE AND NOT BASED ON THE

04:32:06.977 --> 04:32:08.111
AMOUNT OF FUEL THEY USE.

04:32:08.178 --> 04:32:10.080
ESPECIALLY FOR HAWAII, WHERE WE

04:32:10.147 --> 04:32:11.348
DO HAVE RESIDENTS THAT DRIVE

04:32:11.415 --> 04:32:13.016
BIGGER VEHICLES WHO NEED TO

04:32:13.083 --> 04:32:15.218
DRIVE HIGHER MILEAGE, THESE

04:32:15.285 --> 04:32:16.119
RESIDENTS CAN'T AFFORD EITHER

04:32:16.186 --> 04:32:19.156
HIGH MPG VEHICLES OR ELECTRIC

04:32:19.222 --> 04:32:20.057
VEHICLES, SO RIGHT NOW THEY ARE

04:32:20.123 --> 04:32:21.925
CURRENTLY BEING UNFAIRLY

04:32:21.992 --> 04:32:23.794

PRODUCED A DRIVING REPORT,

04:33:06.169 --> 04:33:08.138
WHICH WAS USED AS AN EFFECTIVE

04:33:08.205 --> 04:33:09.940
COMMUNICATION TOOL THAT REACHED

04:33:10.006 --> 04:33:12.576
OVER 350,000 HAWAII HOUSEHOLDS,

04:33:12.642 --> 04:33:14.911

04:33:18.515 --> 04:33:21.051
WOULD PERSONALLY IMPACT THEM.

04:33:21.118 --> 04:33:22.319
IN ADDITION TO THIS DRIVING

04:33:22.385 --> 04:33:25.021

TECHNOLOGY TEST DRIVE WHICH

04:33:27.257 --> 04:33:28.959
HELPED VOLUNTEER PARTICIPANTS

04:33:29.025 --> 04:33:31.228

04:33:31.294 --> 04:33:32.462
CHARGE IS AND TO ACTUALLY GET

HANDS ON EXPERIENCE THROUGH

04:33:34.765 --> 04:33:36.333
DIFFERENT MILEAGE REPORTING

LEADING UP TO OUR FINAL REPORT

04:33:54.951 --> 04:33:56.119

04:34:04.661 --> 04:34:06.029
DIFFERENT LEGISLATIVE

04:34:06.096 --> 04:34:08.198
INITIATIVES THAT WERE LUMPED

04:34:08.265 --> 04:34:09.099
INTO THE BILL THAT SUPPORTED

04:34:09.166 --> 04:34:12.169
NUMEROUS DIFFERENT POLICIES.

04:34:12.235 --> 04:34:13.937
HOWEVER, HAVING THESE NUMEROUS

04:34:14.004 --> 04:34:15.205
DIFFERENT INITIATIVES ADDED TO

04:34:15.272 --> 04:34:17.240
THIS BILL RESULTED IN ITS

04:34:17.307 --> 04:34:19.342
FAILURE. IN THAT SESSION, IT

04:34:19.409 --> 04:34:20.243
WAS CLEAR THAT ANY LEGISLATIVE

04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:21.878
INITIATIVES OUTSIDE OF STRICTLY

04:34:21.945 --> 04:34:24.080
CONVERTING FROM THE GAS TAX TO

04:34:24.147 --> 04:34:25.448
A ROAD USAGE CHARGE WOULD

04:34:25.515 --> 04:34:26.983
RESULT IN THE BILL'S FAILURE.

04:34:27.050 --> 04:34:30.320
AS SUCH, IN 2023, THE HAWAII

04:34:30.387 --> 04:34:32.055
ROAD USER CHARGE BILL WAS THEN

04:34:32.122 --> 04:34:34.124
REINTRODUCED, AND IT WAS SOLELY

04:34:34.191 --> 04:34:34.925
FOCUSED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:34:34.991 --> 04:34:36.159
TRANSPORTATION'S NEED TO MOVE

04:34:36.226 --> 04:34:38.662
FROM THE GAS TAX TO A ROAD USER,

04:34:38.728 --> 04:34:39.863
CHARGE. THIS LEGISLATION AND

04:34:39.930 --> 04:34:43.133
EFFORT, AND IT WAS AND IS

04:34:43.200 --> 04:34:44.501
IMPORTANT TO HAWAII TO ENSURE

04:34:44.568 --> 04:34:47.103
THAT WE MOVE TOWARDS A USER FEE

04:34:47.170 --> 04:34:48.438
PROCESS AS A STEP IN HELPING

04:34:48.505 --> 04:34:50.106
HAWAII, ALL STATES AND THE

04:34:50.173 --> 04:34:53.643
NATION. SO AS THE FOURTH STATE

04:34:53.710 --> 04:34:55.011
TO ADOPT THE ROAD USER CHARGE,

04:34:55.078 --> 04:34:57.547
HAWAII'S ROAD USAGE CHARGE

04:34:57.614 --> 04:34:59.583
LEGISLATION CLOSELY FOLLOWS OUR

04:34:59.649 --> 04:35:00.684
FINAL REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS.

04:35:00.750 --> 04:35:02.953
THE LEGISLATION SPECIFICALLY

04:35:03.019 --> 04:35:04.020
INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING

04:35:04.087 --> 04:35:06.289
PROVISIONS. SO IT BEGAN A ROAD

04:35:06.356 --> 04:35:08.024
USAGE CHARGE, EFFECTIVE JULY

04:35:08.091 --> 04:35:10.293
1ST OF THIS YEAR, SPECIFICALLY

04:35:10.360 --> 04:35:13.263
JUST FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. IT

04:35:13.330 --> 04:35:15.198
ALLOWS EV DRIVERS A CHOICE

04:35:15.265 --> 04:35:17.534
BETWEEN PAYING A PER MILE ROAD

04:35:17.601 --> 04:35:18.101
USER CHARGE AND A $50 FLAT

04:35:18.168 --> 04:35:20.337

LEGISLATION AT $8 PER 1000

04:35:27.244 --> 04:35:29.112
MILES, WHICH IS ABOUT A LITTLE

04:35:29.179 --> 04:35:32.082
BIT LESS THAN A PENNY PER MILE.

04:35:32.148 --> 04:35:34.184
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE STATE

04:35:34.251 --> 04:35:35.185
WILL BE UTILIZING THE ANNUAL

04:35:35.252 --> 04:35:37.220
SAFETY CHECKS FOR MILEAGE

04:35:37.287 --> 04:35:42.259

PER MILE ROAD USAGE CHARGE THAT

04:35:48.098 --> 04:35:49.699
IS MANDATORY FOR ALL ELECTRIC

04:35:49.766 --> 04:35:51.868
VEHICLES, MEANING THAT THE FLAT

04:35:51.935 --> 04:35:55.105
ANNUAL CHOICE GETS REMOVED. IN

04:35:55.171 --> 04:35:56.373
ADDITION TO THE ROAD USER

04:35:56.439 --> 04:35:58.008
CHARGE BEING ALIVE AND ACTIVE,

04:35:58.074 --> 04:36:00.277
THE LEGISLATURE ALSO REQUIRED

04:36:00.343 --> 04:36:01.912
THAT THE HAWAII DEPARTMENT OF

04:36:01.978 --> 04:36:03.046
TRANSPORTATION DEVELOP A

04:36:03.113 --> 04:36:05.548
TRANSITION PLAN TO INCLUDE ALL

04:36:05.615 --> 04:36:07.017
LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES IN THIS

04:36:07.083 --> 04:36:09.452
ROAD USAGE CHARGE PROGRAM. BY

04:36:09.519 --> 04:36:11.021
2033, THE PLAN MUST BE

04:36:11.087 --> 04:36:12.155
COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED TO THE

04:36:12.222 --> 04:36:15.258
LEGISLATURE PRIOR TO THE 2026

04:36:15.325 --> 04:36:16.126
LEGISLATIVE SESSION, AND THIS

04:36:16.192 --> 04:36:17.928
PLAN WILL BE COMPREHENSIVE AND

04:36:17.994 --> 04:36:20.297
LAY OUT THE PLAN TO TRANSITION

04:36:20.363 --> 04:36:24.000
ALL VEHICLES TO A ROCK. NEXT

04:36:24.067 --> 04:36:29.139
SLIDE PLEASE. SO IN OUR WORK

04:36:29.205 --> 04:36:31.141
PROGRAM, WE HAVE MULTIPLE

04:36:31.207 --> 04:36:32.909
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED IN

04:36:32.976 --> 04:36:34.044
IMPLEMENTATION. AND NOT ALL

04:36:34.110 --> 04:36:35.412
AGENCIES ARE ALIGNED WITH ONE

04:36:35.478 --> 04:36:37.047
ANOTHER OR AT THE SAME LEVEL OF

04:36:37.113 --> 04:36:39.015
GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE THE STATE

04:36:39.082 --> 04:36:40.183
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AS

04:36:40.250 --> 04:36:41.284
THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE

04:36:41.351 --> 04:36:43.486
PROGRAM. WE ALSO PARTNER WITH

04:36:43.553 --> 04:36:45.422
OUR FOUR COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF

04:36:45.488 --> 04:36:47.157
MOTOR VEHICLES, OUR FOUR COUNTY

04:36:47.223 --> 04:36:49.259
DEPARTMENTS OF FINANCE AND THE

HONOLULU CITY DEPARTMENT OF IT,

04:36:52.529 --> 04:36:53.229
WHICH SUPPORTS ALL FOUR

04:36:53.296 --> 04:36:55.365
COUNTIES. MORE VEHICLE SYSTEMS.

04:36:55.432 --> 04:36:57.267
AS YOU CAN SEE IN IMPLEMENTING

04:36:57.334 --> 04:36:59.936
A ROTC PROGRAM, COLLABORATION

04:37:00.003 --> 04:37:01.204
IS NEEDED AMONGST ALL OF THE

04:37:01.271 --> 04:37:03.106
AGENCIES IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT

04:37:03.173 --> 04:37:03.940
A ROAD USAGE CHARGE. AS

04:37:04.007 --> 04:37:06.142
SPECIFICALLY IN HAWAII. EACH

04:37:06.209 --> 04:37:07.811
COUNTY HAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

04:37:07.877 --> 04:37:09.312
VENDORS, PROCESSES AND

04:37:09.379 --> 04:37:11.114
REQUIREMENTS. SO SINCE JANUARY

04:37:11.181 --> 04:37:12.849
OF 2024, WE'VE BEEN MEETING

04:37:12.916 --> 04:37:13.950
ALTOGETHER WITH THE FOUR

04:37:14.017 --> 04:37:15.251
COUNTIES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:37:15.318 --> 04:37:17.954
IT. WE'VE HELD NUMEROUS ONE ON

04:37:18.021 --> 04:37:19.322
ONE MEETINGS WITH EACH COUNTIES

04:37:19.389 --> 04:37:21.291
AND VARIOUS AND THEIR VARIOUS

04:37:21.358 --> 04:37:22.092
VENDORS THAT SUPPORT THE STATE

04:37:22.158 --> 04:37:26.162
AND COUNTY OPERATIONS. THIS LED,

04:37:26.229 --> 04:37:27.063
INCLUSIVE APPROACH HAS ALLOWED

04:37:27.130 --> 04:37:29.132
US TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS IN A

04:37:29.199 --> 04:37:30.834
RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME,

04:37:30.900 --> 04:37:32.068
AND AT EACH STEP, WE'VE

04:37:32.135 --> 04:37:33.703
COLLECTED DATA, INTERVIEWED OUR

04:37:33.770 --> 04:37:35.372
PARTNERS, PERFORMED DETAILED

04:37:35.438 --> 04:37:37.440
ANALYSIS, AND COME UP WITH

04:37:37.507 --> 04:37:39.843
WORKABLE OPTIONS TO ACHIEVE

04:37:39.909 --> 04:37:41.411
CONSENSUS AND RESULTS IN A

04:37:41.478 --> 04:37:45.715
TIMELY MANNER. NEXT SLIDE

04:37:45.782 --> 04:37:51.021
PLEASE. SO THIS IS A QUICK

04:37:51.087 --> 04:37:52.856
SCHEMATIC OF WHAT THE ROAD USER

04:37:52.922 --> 04:37:54.758
CHARGE AND HOW IT WORKS IN

04:37:54.824 --> 04:37:56.292
HAWAII. SO LIKE I MENTIONED

04:37:56.359 --> 04:37:57.861
BEFORE, THE HAWAII ROAD USER

04:37:57.927 --> 04:37:59.162
CHARGE PROGRAM DOES UTILIZE THE

04:37:59.229 --> 04:38:01.064
EXISTING SAFETY CHECK AND

04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:02.432
ANNUAL VEHICLE REGISTRATION

04:38:02.499 --> 04:38:05.168
PROCESS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

04:38:05.235 --> 04:38:07.270
UPHELD AND WITHSTANDING. AND

04:38:07.337 --> 04:38:09.139
THIS REALLY WAS TO UTILIZE THE

04:38:09.205 --> 04:38:10.874
EXISTING SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THE

04:38:10.940 --> 04:38:11.975
SMOOTH IMPLEMENTATION AND

04:38:12.042 --> 04:38:14.177
OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM. SO

04:38:14.244 --> 04:38:15.912
FROM A DRIVER'S PERSPECTIVE,

04:38:15.979 --> 04:38:17.080
THEY'LL JUST CONTINUE TO DRIVE

04:38:17.147 --> 04:38:19.082
THEIR VEHICLE AS NORMAL AND

04:38:19.149 --> 04:38:20.683
WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT THEIR

04:38:20.750 --> 04:38:21.451
SAFETY CHECKS AND REGISTRATION

04:38:21.518 --> 04:38:24.187
RENEWALS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. ON

04:38:24.254 --> 04:38:25.989
THE BACK END, THE HAWAII

04:38:26.056 --> 04:38:27.390
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

04:38:27.457 --> 04:38:29.826
AND THE COUNTY DMVS, AS WELL AS

04:38:29.893 --> 04:38:31.127
OUR SAFETY INSPECTIONS, WILL

04:38:31.194 --> 04:38:33.730
HANDLE THE ROAD USAGE CHARGE

04:38:33.797 --> 04:38:35.298
CALCULATIONS AND THE PAYMENTS.

04:38:35.365 --> 04:38:37.867
I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT IN OUR

04:38:37.934 --> 04:38:39.469
ANNUAL VEHICLE INSPECTION

04:38:39.536 --> 04:38:42.806
PROCESS, WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY

04:38:42.872 --> 04:38:45.408
OUTSTANDING, THE PART OF THE

04:38:45.475 --> 04:38:47.577
INSPECTION PROCESS IS REQUIRED

04:38:47.644 --> 04:38:48.211
REQUIRES AN ODOMETER READING TO

04:38:48.278 --> 04:38:51.147
BE CAPTURED AT THAT TIME OF

04:38:51.214 --> 04:38:52.082
INSPECTION, AND THE INSPECTION

04:38:52.148 --> 04:38:54.417
NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED BEFORE A

04:38:54.484 --> 04:38:56.219
REGISTRATION CAN OCCUR. SO

04:38:56.286 --> 04:38:58.588
RESEARCH SHOWED THAT LEVERAGING

04:38:58.655 --> 04:39:01.324
THIS EXISTING SYSTEM WOULD BE

04:39:01.391 --> 04:39:02.425
THE LEAST EXPENSIVE WAY TO

04:39:02.492 --> 04:39:04.227
ADMINISTRATE A ROAD USAGE

04:39:04.294 --> 04:39:05.762
CHARGE PROGRAM IN HAWAII,

04:39:05.829 --> 04:39:07.263
RATHER THAN REINVENTING THE

04:39:07.330 --> 04:39:14.237
WHEEL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND

04:39:14.304 --> 04:39:16.139
THEN A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT

04:39:16.206 --> 04:39:18.541
THE HAWAII ROAD USAGE CHARGE

04:39:18.608 --> 04:39:20.009
PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE FROM AN EV

04:39:20.076 --> 04:39:23.213
OWNER'S EXPERIENCE. SO

04:39:23.279 --> 04:39:26.116
BEGINNING ON JULY 1ST, 2025,

04:39:26.182 --> 04:39:27.417
ELIGIBLE EV OWNERS WILL SEE THE

04:39:27.484 --> 04:39:29.052
ROAD USAGE CHARGE ON THEIR

04:39:29.119 --> 04:39:31.121
REGISTRATION RENEWAL NOTICE. ON

04:39:31.187 --> 04:39:32.922
THAT NOTICE, EV DRIVERS WILL

04:39:32.989 --> 04:39:34.290
THEN BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

04:39:34.357 --> 04:39:36.192
EITHER PAYING A PER MILE ROAD

04:39:36.259 --> 04:39:38.361
USAGE CHARGE THAT'S CAPPED AT

04:39:38.428 --> 04:39:39.262
$50, OR A FLAT ANNUAL ROAD

04:39:39.329 --> 04:39:43.133
USAGE CHARGE OF $50. THE ROAD

04:39:43.199 --> 04:39:44.367
USAGE CHARGE CHOICE THAT THEY

04:39:44.434 --> 04:39:46.069
MAKE WILL THEN BE OWED TO THEIR

04:39:46.136 --> 04:39:47.303
VEHICLE REGISTRATION PAYMENT

04:39:47.370 --> 04:39:49.105
PROCESS, SO IT'S JUST ANOTHER

04:39:49.172 --> 04:39:51.207
LINE ITEM ON THE EXISTING

04:39:51.274 --> 04:39:53.409
REGISTRATION PAYMENT, AND THEN

04:39:53.476 --> 04:39:54.210
THEY CAN COMPLETE THEIR

04:39:54.277 --> 04:39:55.645
REGISTRATION RENEWAL USING ANY

04:39:55.712 --> 04:39:57.714
OF THE EXISTING REGISTRATION

04:39:57.780 --> 04:40:00.083
RENEWAL METHODS. SO JUST A

04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:03.520
QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM.

04:40:03.586 --> 04:40:05.421
I'M HAPPY TO STICK AROUND IF

04:40:05.488 --> 04:40:07.790
THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THE

04:40:07.857 --> 04:40:10.160
PANEL. THANK YOU. I'LL ASK A

04:40:10.226 --> 04:40:11.361
QUICK QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE

04:40:11.427 --> 04:40:13.029
ON TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY

04:40:13.096 --> 04:40:15.598
BECAUSE WE DID. WE ARE WE ARE

04:40:15.665 --> 04:40:17.133
LIMITED TO THE CHAIR NOW. AND

04:40:17.200 --> 04:40:19.068
THAT IS IF YOU IF THEY PICK THE

04:40:19.135 --> 04:40:20.303
PER MILE THAT DOES THAT MEAN

04:40:20.370 --> 04:40:21.905
THEY PAY AT THEIR INSPECTION.

04:40:21.971 --> 04:40:24.007
THEY PAY AT THE TIME OF

04:40:24.073 --> 04:40:25.241
REGISTRATION. THEY STILL PAY AT

04:40:25.308 --> 04:40:27.377
THE TIME OF REGISTRATION. IF

04:40:27.443 --> 04:40:29.145
IT'S THE PER MILE CAPPED, IF

04:40:29.212 --> 04:40:30.980
THEY CHOOSE THE PER MILE OR THE

04:40:31.047 --> 04:40:34.083
FLAT FEE, IT'LL BE ADDED ONTO

04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:35.919
THEIR REGISTRATION FEES. OKAY,

04:40:35.985 --> 04:40:38.188
YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD, BUT HOW

04:40:38.254 --> 04:40:40.223
WOULD THEY GET THE REFUND IF

04:40:40.290 --> 04:40:42.158
IT'S PER MILE? IF IF THEY ONLY

04:40:42.225 --> 04:40:43.960
DID $40 WORTH, IT WOULD BE AN

04:40:44.027 --> 04:40:47.463
OFFSET AT THE NEXT REGISTRATION.

04:40:47.530 --> 04:40:48.498
NØ. SO THE INSPECTION ALWAYS

04:40:48.565 --> 04:40:50.200
HAPPENS BEFORE THE REGISTRATION.

04:40:50.266 --> 04:40:52.869
OH OKAY. YEAH. AT THE TIME OF

04:40:52.936 --> 04:40:54.504
THE REGISTRATION, THEY ONLY

04:40:54.571 --> 04:40:56.239
DROVE IN 40 MILES WORTH. ON THE

04:40:56.306 --> 04:40:57.407
REGISTRATION, IT'LL ONLY SHOW

04:40:57.473 --> 04:41:00.343
THE $40. OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD.

04:41:00.410 --> 04:41:02.111
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MOVING

04:41:02.178 --> 04:41:12.622
MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER.

04:41:12.689 --> 04:41:16.226
CAN YOU HEAR ME? WE CAN.

04:41:16.292 --> 04:41:19.162
AWESOME. MY NAME IS LEE FELDER.

04:41:19.229 --> 04:41:21.231
I WORK FOR THE UTAH DEPARTMENT

04:41:21.297 --> 04:41:23.633
OF TRANSPORTATION AND HAVE

04:41:23.700 --> 04:41:26.469
SPENT ABOUT 20 YEARS WORKING IN

04:41:26.536 --> 04:41:28.137
STATE GOVERNMENT. 13 OF THOSE

04:41:28.204 --> 04:41:32.041
YEARS WERE STAFFING OUR STATE

04:41:32.108 --> 04:41:33.977
LEGISLATURE. SO, MADAM CHAIR,

04:41:34.043 --> 04:41:36.179
YOU RUN A GREAT MEETING. AND I

04:41:36.246 --> 04:41:38.014
ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU YOU HAVE

04:41:38.081 --> 04:41:40.316
SOME REALLY FANTASTIC STAFF.

04:41:40.383 --> 04:41:41.317
THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD TO

04:41:41.384 --> 04:41:45.021
WORK WITH. THANK YOU, I AGREE.

04:41:45.088 --> 04:41:48.091
OKAY. SO I'M JUST GOING TO JUMP

04:41:48.157 --> 04:41:50.159
RIGHT INTO THIS. I KNOW PEOPLE,

04:41:50.226 --> 04:41:51.894
IT'S LATE. PEOPLE ARE ARE

04:41:51.961 --> 04:41:55.598
PROBABLY TIRED. SO YOU UTAH

04:41:55.665 --> 04:41:57.233
BELIEVES IN FAIRNESS AND

04:41:57.300 --> 04:41:59.402
RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO

04:41:59.469 --> 04:42:02.338
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. AND WE

04:42:02.405 --> 04:42:04.207
THINK THE FUEL TAX USED TO

04:42:04.274 --> 04:42:07.043
MATCH THOSE VALUES. AND YOU

04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:09.912
KNOW, IN SHORT, IT USED TO BE A

04:42:09.979 --> 04:42:12.181
SYSTEM WHERE YOU PAID FOR WHAT

04:42:12.248 --> 04:42:16.019
YOU USED. AND BECAUSE OF OF THE

04:42:16.085 --> 04:42:18.154
REASONS I LOVED TRISHA'S

04:42:18.221 --> 04:42:19.922
PRESENTATION WITH WITH THE

04:42:19.989 --> 04:42:22.859
EMBASSY GROUP, SHE DID A

04:42:22.925 --> 04:42:25.094
FANTASTIC JOB KIND OF SHOWING

04:42:25.161 --> 04:42:27.864
HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED. AND I

04:42:27.930 --> 04:42:31.134
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THAT.

04:42:31.200 --> 04:42:35.104
THE GAS TAX WAS WAS ORIGINALLY

04:42:35.171 --> 04:42:36.873
CREATED WITH THAT PHILOSOPHY.

04:42:36.939 --> 04:42:39.409
AND THIS THIS CHART HERE IS

04:42:39.475 --> 04:42:41.978
REALLY TO KIND OF SHOW, HEY, IF

04:42:42.045 --> 04:42:43.313
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT

04:42:43.379 --> 04:42:48.051
THE GAS TAX. THERE'S PROBLEMS

04:42:48.117 --> 04:42:50.386
AHEAD. AND THE LONGER WE DON'T

04:42:50.453 --> 04:42:52.188
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, THE MORE

04:42:52.255 --> 04:42:54.090
WE'RE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE

04:42:54.157 --> 04:42:57.060
ROAD. SO GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE

04:42:57.126 --> 04:43:01.597
NEXT SLIDE. THIS SHOWS KIND OF

04:43:01.664 --> 04:43:03.232
OUR LEGISLATIVE PATHWAY THAT WE

04:43:03.299 --> 04:43:05.468
WENT THROUGH TO GET TO THE ROAD

04:43:05.535 --> 04:43:08.137
USAGE CHARGE. THE VERY FIRST

04:43:08.204 --> 04:43:11.374
ITEM ON THEIR SHOWS YOU THAT

04:43:11.441 --> 04:43:13.142
THE LEGISLATURE THE UTAH

04:43:13.209 --> 04:43:16.212
LEGISLATURE STARTED A TASK

04:43:16.279 --> 04:43:19.482
FORCE BACK IN 2003. AND FOUR.

04:43:19.549 --> 04:43:21.617
AND THIS IS KIND OF THE FIRST

04:43:21.684 --> 04:43:24.087
TIME WHERE THE LEGISLATURE

04:43:24.153 --> 04:43:25.822
CONSIDERED A MILEAGE BASED

04:43:25.888 --> 04:43:29.192
FUNDING METHOD. AND OF COURSE,

04:43:29.258 --> 04:43:30.960
IT REALLY WASN'T RIPE AT THAT

04:43:31.027 --> 04:43:32.995
TIME. IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD

04:43:33.062 --> 04:43:35.298
IDEA AT THAT TIME, BUT IT ISN'T

04:43:35.365 --> 04:43:37.133
SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST GO AND

04:43:37.200 --> 04:43:40.269
IMPLEMENT QUICKLY. IT IT

04:43:40.336 --> 04:43:43.740
REQUIRES SOME CHANGE OF MIND.

04:43:43.806 --> 04:43:45.041
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF EFFORT.

04:43:45.108 --> 04:43:47.076
AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

04:43:47.143 --> 04:43:48.344
EFFORT OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS

04:43:48.411 --> 04:43:51.047
TO, TO GET US TO WHERE WE'RE AT.

04:43:51.114 --> 04:43:53.182
AND I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT AT

04:43:53.249 --> 04:43:55.318
THAT TIME, OUR LEGISLATURE

04:43:55.385 --> 04:43:58.955
CHOSE TO BRING IN SOME SALES

04:43:59.021 --> 04:44:01.090
TAX MONEY INTO OUR

04:44:01.157 --> 04:44:02.225
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING SYSTEM,

04:44:02.291 --> 04:44:04.127
AND THEY ACTUALLY EARMARK SOME

04:44:04.193 --> 04:44:06.596
SALES TAXES. THAT GOES INTO OUR

04:44:06.662 --> 04:44:10.133
OUR ROAD CAPACITY PROGRAM. AND

04:44:10.199 --> 04:44:12.068
YOU CAN SEE THE NEXT STEP THERE

04:44:12.135 --> 04:44:17.039
IN 2015. UDOT WAS GIVEN THE

04:44:17.106 --> 04:44:19.709
TASK TO STUDY MORE EARNESTLY,

04:44:19.776 --> 04:44:23.446
WHICH WE DID. WE HAD LOOKED

04:44:23.513 --> 04:44:24.947
INTO DOING A PILOT AND AND JUST

04:44:25.014 --> 04:44:27.417
KIND OF STUDIED THE ISSUE AND

04:44:27.483 --> 04:44:28.418
REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE ON

04:44:28.484 --> 04:44:30.520
THAT. WE ALSO DID RAISE OUR GAS

04:44:30.586 --> 04:44:32.288
TAX AT THAT TIME. AND THAT'S

04:44:32.355 --> 04:44:36.325
ALSO WHEN WE INDEXED OUR FUEL

04:44:36.392 --> 04:44:39.228
TAX TO INFLATION. THEN IN 2017,

04:44:39.295 --> 04:44:43.099
WE ESTABLISHED ANOTHER FUNDING

04:44:43.166 --> 04:44:46.402
TASK FORCE FOR TRANSPORTATION.

04:44:46.469 --> 04:44:49.205
AND OUT OF THAT CAME A BILL

04:44:49.272 --> 04:44:54.377
THAT ESTABLISHED A COMMITTEE TO

04:44:54.444 --> 04:44:57.847
LOOK AT HOW TO STAND UP A RUCK

04:44:57.914 --> 04:45:00.850
PROGRAM IN UTAH. AND THEN, OF

04:45:00.917 --> 04:45:03.052
COURSE, IN 2019, WE HAD ANOTHER

04:45:03.119 --> 04:45:06.122
BILL WHICH ESTABLISHED OUR ROAD

04:45:06.189 --> 04:45:09.058
USER CHARGE PROGRAM. AND THAT,

04:45:09.125 --> 04:45:11.294
OF COURSE, BEGAN ON JANUARY 1ST

04:45:11.360 --> 04:45:18.100
OF 2020. LET'S GO AHEAD TO THE

04:45:18.167 --> 04:45:23.072
NEXT SLIDE. HERE'S ANOTHER

04:45:23.139 --> 04:45:25.041
SLIDE TO KIND OF HELP

04:45:25.107 --> 04:45:27.210
UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY IN AT

04:45:27.276 --> 04:45:30.279
LEAST IN UTAH. AND I THINK

04:45:30.346 --> 04:45:31.013
CALIFORNIA IS PROBABLY IN A

04:45:31.080 --> 04:45:33.883
SIMILAR SITUATION. UTAH'S A

04:45:33.950 --> 04:45:36.285
STATE WHERE EV VEHICLES HAVE

04:45:36.352 --> 04:45:41.023
BEEN HIGHLY ADOPTED. AND AND WE

04:45:41.090 --> 04:45:42.458
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

04:45:42.525 --> 04:45:44.227
INTERESTED IN CHOOSING THAT

04:45:44.293 --> 04:45:46.796
METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION. YOU

04:45:46.863 --> 04:45:49.765
CAN SEE IN 2024, WE HAD 74,000

04:45:49.832 --> 04:45:51.234
NEW VEHICLES THAT WERE

04:45:51.300 --> 04:45:55.171
REGISTERED, 44% OF THOSE WERE A

04:45:55.238 --> 04:45:58.841
HIGHLY EFFICIENT VEHICLE. AND

04:45:58.908 --> 04:46:02.044
THAT WOULD INCLUDE EVS. SO 20%

04:46:02.111 --> 04:46:05.181
OF THAT TOTAL, 74,000 WERE

04:46:05.248 --> 04:46:07.550
ACTUALLY EVS NEWLY REGISTERED

04:46:07.617 --> 04:46:09.986
IN UTAH. THIS CHANGE IN UTAH'S

04:46:10.052 --> 04:46:12.221
FLEET CONTINUES TO PUT PRESSURE

04:46:12.288 --> 04:46:15.958
ON THE GAS TAX SYSTEM. LET'S GO

04:46:16.025 --> 04:46:20.096
TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT ARE

04:46:20.162 --> 04:46:23.232
WE DOING ABOUT THESE ISSUES?

04:46:23.299 --> 04:46:25.735
AGAIN, THE UTAH PROGRAM BEGAN

04:46:25.801 --> 04:46:29.305
ON JANUARY 1ST, 2020. THIS IS A

04:46:29.372 --> 04:46:30.640
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM SIMILAR TO

04:46:30.706 --> 04:46:33.376
WHAT HAWAII JUST PRESENTED WHEN

04:46:33.442 --> 04:46:36.179
IT FIRST BEGAN. OWNERS OF

04:46:36.245 --> 04:46:38.681
HYBRIDS, PLUG INS AND EVS COULD

04:46:38.748 --> 04:46:40.182
JOIN. WE HAVE SINCE

04:46:40.249 --> 04:46:43.686
DISCONTINUED THE ABILITY FOR

04:46:43.753 --> 04:46:45.755
ADDITIONAL HYBRID AND PLUG INS

04:46:45.821 --> 04:46:48.057
TO JOIN, SO ONLY WE'RE ONLY

04:46:48.124 --> 04:46:50.993
ACCEPTING EVS INTO THE PROGRAM,

04:46:51.060 --> 04:46:53.429
THOUGH THOSE PLUG INS AND

04:46:53.496 --> 04:46:55.264
HYBRIDS THAT JOIN PREVIOUSLY

04:46:55.331 --> 04:46:57.199
ARE ARE ABLE TO STAY IN IF THEY

04:46:57.266 --> 04:47:02.405
CHOOSE TO DO SO. SO AT THIS, WE,

04:47:02.471 --> 04:47:04.273
THE LEGISLATURE, ESTABLISHED AN

04:47:04.340 --> 04:47:07.944
ANNUAL FEE FOR EVS, AND THAT

04:47:08.010 --> 04:47:11.213
FEE IS CURRENTLY $143. SO THE

04:47:11.280 --> 04:47:14.050
WAY THIS WORKS IS AN EV OWNER

04:47:14.116 --> 04:47:16.118
CAN CHOOSE TO PAY THE ANNUAL

04:47:16.185 --> 04:47:17.920
FEE OR JOIN THE RUCK PROGRAM.

04:47:17.987 --> 04:47:20.156
IF THEY JOIN THE RUCK PROGRAM,

04:47:20.222 --> 04:47:22.358
THEY ONLY PAY FOR WHAT THEY USE

04:47:22.425 --> 04:47:25.161
AND THEY'RE CHARGED BY THE MILE.

04:47:25.227 --> 04:47:29.098
AND THAT RATE IS SET AT 1.11

04:47:29.165 --> 04:47:31.367
CENTS PER MILE. AND OF COURSE,

04:47:31.434 --> 04:47:34.870
THE RUCK CHARGES ARE CAPPED AT

04:47:34.937 --> 04:47:38.274
THAT $143 MARK. SO THEY WON'T

04:47:38.341 --> 04:47:40.943
PAY MORE THAN THAT ANNUAL FEE.

04:47:41.010 --> 04:47:43.145
BUT THEY COULD HAVE THE

04:47:43.212 --> 04:47:44.413
OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE, WHICH THAT

04:47:44.480 --> 04:47:47.416
REALLY IS WHAT GIVES US THE THE

04:47:47.483 --> 04:47:48.284
ABILITY TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE

04:47:48.351 --> 04:47:51.153
TO JOIN THE PROGRAM. THEY CAN'T

04:47:51.220 --> 04:47:53.122
LOSE, BUT THEY COULD SAVE. AND

04:47:53.189 --> 04:47:54.123
I'LL NOTE THAT BOTH THE ANNUAL

04:47:54.190 --> 04:47:56.092
FEE AND THE RUCK RATE ARE

04:47:56.158 --> 04:47:58.227
INDEXED TO INFLATION. SO THEY

04:47:58.294 --> 04:48:01.831
INCREASE ANNUALLY BASED ON THAT

04:48:01.897 --> 04:48:06.502
NEXT SLIDE. THE FIRST FOUR

04:48:06.569 --> 04:48:08.037
YEARS OF THE PROGRAM, WE USED

04:48:08.104 --> 04:48:10.272
ODOMETER REPORTING AND WHAT'S

04:48:10.339 --> 04:48:14.076
CALLED AN OBD2 PORT PLUG-IN

04:48:14.143 --> 04:48:18.381
DEVICE. AN OBD2 PORT IS A

04:48:18.447 --> 04:48:19.849
STANDARD PORT IN MANY VEHICLES

04:48:19.915 --> 04:48:22.051
THAT ALLOWS ACCESS TO THE

04:48:22.118 --> 04:48:23.653
VEHICLE'S COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR

04:48:23.719 --> 04:48:26.055
DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES, AND THAT

04:48:26.122 --> 04:48:29.258
INCLUDES MILEAGE INFORMATION OR

04:48:29.325 --> 04:48:32.194
ODOMETER INFORMATION. THE FIRST

04:48:32.261 --> 04:48:33.996
REPORTING OPTION THAT WE HAD

04:48:34.063 --> 04:48:37.099
WAS WAS A BIT EXPENSIVE AND

04:48:37.166 --> 04:48:40.036
KIND OF CLUNKY. WE HIRED A NEW

04:48:40.102 --> 04:48:42.171
ACCOUNT MANAGER LAST YEAR IN

04:48:42.238 --> 04:48:45.708
2024, AND WITH THAT CAME A NEW

04:48:45.775 --> 04:48:47.476
REPORTING SYSTEM. YOU CAN SEE

04:48:47.543 --> 04:48:50.613
ON THIS SLIDE THAT WE NOW HAVE

04:48:50.680 --> 04:48:52.248
TWO OPTIONS. AND THEY'RE USED

04:48:52.314 --> 04:48:55.284
ABOUT EQUALLY. THE ODOMETER

04:48:55.351 --> 04:48:57.520
PHOTO OPTION AND THE TELEMATICS

04:48:57.586 --> 04:49:00.890
OPTION. THE ODOMETER PHOTO

04:49:00.956 --> 04:49:04.894
USERS USE AN APP TO SUBMIT A

04:49:04.960 --> 04:49:07.263
PICTURE OF THE ODOMETER, WHICH

04:49:07.329 --> 04:49:09.799
IS USED TO CALCULATE THE RUCK

04:49:09.865 --> 04:49:11.434
CHARGE. THE TELEMATICS OPTION

04:49:11.500 --> 04:49:14.236
IS USED FOR NEWER EVS THAT HAVE

04:49:14.303 --> 04:49:16.072
A TELEMATICS FEATURE. A THIRD

04:49:16.138 --> 04:49:18.374
PARTY VENDOR PINGS THE VEHICLE.

04:49:18.441 --> 04:49:21.010
THE VEHICLE WIRES WIRELESSLY

04:49:21.077 --> 04:49:22.845
SENDS THE INFO TO THE THIRD

04:49:22.912 --> 04:49:25.448
PARTY VENDOR, WHO SENDS UDOT

04:49:25.514 --> 04:49:30.019
THE MILEAGE AND THE VIN. I

04:49:30.086 --> 04:49:32.588
WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE

04:49:32.655 --> 04:49:34.123
IMPORTANCE OF PRIVACY AND THAT

04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:36.559
THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER BY

04:49:36.625 --> 04:49:39.095
BY TRISH. SHE DID A GREAT JOB

04:49:39.161 --> 04:49:41.363
HIGHLIGHTING THAT ISSUE. AND SO

04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:44.433
WE'VE MADE SURE THAT WE ONLY

04:49:44.500 --> 04:49:45.367
RECEIVE DATA THAT IS NEEDED FOR

04:49:45.434 --> 04:49:47.203
THE BILLING. AND IN THIS CASE

04:49:47.269 --> 04:49:49.305
IT'S THE VIN AND THE MILEAGE.

04:49:49.371 --> 04:49:51.040
AND THEN OF COURSE WE DESTROY

04:49:51.107 --> 04:49:55.244
DATA AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE.

04:49:55.311 --> 04:49:59.949
NEXT SLIDE. THIS CHART SHOWS

04:50:00.015 --> 04:50:02.084
ENROLLMENT SINCE THE BEGINNING

04:50:02.151 --> 04:50:03.953
OF THE PROGRAM. THE BLUE AND

04:50:04.019 --> 04:50:06.589
BROWN SHOW HYBRIDS AND PLUG INS,

04:50:06.655 --> 04:50:08.891
WHICH, AS I MENTIONED EARLIER,

04:50:08.958 --> 04:50:11.060
CAN NO LONGER JOIN THE PROGRAM.

04:50:11.127 --> 04:50:14.396
EVS ARE IN THE GREEN. WE HAVE

04:50:14.463 --> 04:50:16.065
DOUBLED ENROLLMENT IN THE LAST

04:50:16.132 --> 04:50:18.267
YEAR, AND WE'RE ADDING ABOUT

04:50:18.334 --> 04:50:21.537
400 USERS PER MONTH. WE'RE

04:50:21.604 --> 04:50:22.938
ABOUT TO HIT 10,000

04:50:23.005 --> 04:50:24.106
PARTICIPANTS PROBABLY NEXT

04:50:24.173 --> 04:50:27.009
MONTH. THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF AN

04:50:27.076 --> 04:50:29.512
EXCITING THING. AS WE START TO

04:50:29.578 --> 04:50:30.880
SCALE UP. IT'S IT'S REALLY

04:50:30.946 --> 04:50:33.315
PRETTY COOL. LET'S GO TO THE

04:50:33.382 --> 04:50:35.284
NEXT SLIDE. THIS SLIDE SHOWS

04:50:35.351 --> 04:50:38.687
SOME OF THE THE EXPENSES AND

04:50:38.754 --> 04:50:40.022
REVENUES FOR THE PROGRAM. ONE

04:50:40.089 --> 04:50:42.525
OF THE CHALLENGES FOR A PROGRAM

04:50:42.591 --> 04:50:45.261
IS KEEPING THE ADMIN COSTS LOW.

04:50:45.327 --> 04:50:47.329
AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE

04:50:47.396 --> 04:50:51.634
GAS TAX IS REALLY PRETTY

04:50:51.700 --> 04:50:52.334
INEXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER.

04:50:52.401 --> 04:50:53.936
IT'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO BE

04:50:54.003 --> 04:50:57.206
AS EFFICIENT AS THE GAS TAX.

04:50:57.273 --> 04:50:59.041
BEFORE WE SIGNED OUR NEW

04:50:59.108 --> 04:51:02.178
CONTRACT IN FY 25, THE PROGRAM

04:51:02.244 --> 04:51:04.246
WAS SMALL AND VERY INEFFICIENT.

04:51:04.313 --> 04:51:06.282
UNDER THE NEW CONTRACT, WE HAVE

04:51:06.348 --> 04:51:08.918
GAINED SOME EFFICIENCIES AND

04:51:08.984 --> 04:51:10.820
GROWN THE PROGRAM, WHICH HAS

04:51:10.886 --> 04:51:13.022
LED TO A 66% COST REDUCTION. AS

04:51:13.088 --> 04:51:15.257
THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW,

04:51:15.324 --> 04:51:17.893
WE EXPECT COSTS TO CONTINUE TO

04:51:17.960 --> 04:51:20.896
GO DOWN AND REVENUES TO

04:51:20.963 --> 04:51:26.035
INCREASE. NEXT SLIDE. THE LAST

04:51:26.101 --> 04:51:28.103
THING I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU

04:51:28.170 --> 04:51:30.039
ARE A COUPLE OF RUCK CHANGES

04:51:30.105 --> 04:51:32.074
THAT THE UTAH LEGISLATURE IS

04:51:32.141 --> 04:51:33.375
NOW CONSIDERING, JUST TO GIVE

04:51:33.442 --> 04:51:35.711
YOU A FLAVOR FOR SOME OF THE

04:51:35.778 --> 04:51:37.213
POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE

04:51:37.279 --> 04:51:38.914
BEING MADE, THESE SCENARIOS ARE

04:51:38.981 --> 04:51:42.284
NOT TO BE ARE MEANT TO BE AN

04:51:42.351 --> 04:51:44.119
INCREMENTAL STEP TO MOVING THE

04:51:44.186 --> 04:51:46.488
RUCK PROGRAM TOWARD THE

04:51:46.555 --> 04:51:48.991
EVENTUAL GOAL OF ALL VEHICLES

04:51:49.058 --> 04:51:51.493
PARTICIPATING AND PAYING FOR

04:51:51.560 --> 04:51:53.395
WHAT THEY USE. AND AGAIN, WHEN

04:51:53.462 --> 04:51:55.931
UTAH TALKS ABOUT A RUCK, WE'RE

04:51:55.998 --> 04:51:58.267
TALKING ABOUT A REPLACEMENT FOR

04:51:58.334 --> 04:52:01.303
THE GAS TAX. THERE IS NO

04:52:01.370 --> 04:52:04.139
INTEREST OR DESIRE TO HAVE A

04:52:04.206 --> 04:52:07.076
NEW TAX THAT IS PILED ON TOP OF

04:52:07.142 --> 04:52:11.247
THAT GAS TAX. OKAY, SO THIS IS

04:52:11.313 --> 04:52:13.115
THE FIRST SCENARIO. THIS WOULD

04:52:13.182 --> 04:52:18.454
REMOVE THE PAYMENT CAP AND AND

04:52:18.520 --> 04:52:21.357
HAVE FOR RUCK PARTICIPANTS SUCH

04:52:21.423 --> 04:52:23.926
AS EV OWNERS. AND THEN THEY

04:52:23.993 --> 04:52:26.061
WOULD PAY FOR WHAT THEY USE.

04:52:26.128 --> 04:52:27.863
THE BAR CHART COMPARES

04:52:27.930 --> 04:52:30.099
PROJECTIONS FOR THE STATUS QUO,

04:52:30.165 --> 04:52:32.167
MEANING THE PROGRAM I JUST

04:52:32.234 --> 04:52:34.069
EXPLAINED TO YOU WITH THE

04:52:34.136 --> 04:52:37.339
SCENARIO ONE WHERE THE THE CAP

04:52:37.406 --> 04:52:40.843
IS REMOVED AND THIS SHOWS OUR

04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:44.747
PROJECTIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR

04:52:44.813 --> 04:52:47.316
2027. YOU CAN SEE UNDER THIS

04:52:47.383 --> 04:52:48.517
SCENARIO WE PROJECT THAT WE

04:52:48.584 --> 04:52:50.886
WOULD LOSE SOME PARTICIPANTS.

04:52:50.953 --> 04:52:52.254
AND OF COURSE THE REASON FOR

04:52:52.321 --> 04:52:54.290
THAT IS IF YOU REMOVE THE CAP,

04:52:54.356 --> 04:52:55.991
THERE ARE GOING TO BE

04:52:56.058 --> 04:52:59.962
PARTICIPANTS THAT WILL PAY MORE

04:53:00.029 --> 04:53:03.565
UNDER THAT SCENARIO. AND SO WE

04:53:03.632 --> 04:53:05.467
WOULD EXPECT PEOPLE TO MAKE, OF

04:53:05.534 --> 04:53:07.102
COURSE, THE RATIONAL DECISION

04:53:07.169 --> 04:53:08.938
TO LEAVE THE PROGRAM AND PAY

04:53:09.004 --> 04:53:11.573
THE ANNUAL FEE. IF THEY PROJECT

04:53:11.640 --> 04:53:12.975
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DRIVE

04:53:13.042 --> 04:53:17.313
MORE MILES THAN. THAN WOULD BE

04:53:17.379 --> 04:53:19.048
ALLOWED UNDER THE PROGRAM AND

04:53:19.114 --> 04:53:21.884
STILL PAY LESS THAN THAT ANNUAL

04:53:21.951 --> 04:53:25.854
FEE. NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS MY

04:53:25.921 --> 04:53:28.157
FINAL SLIDE SHOWING THE SECOND

04:53:28.223 --> 04:53:30.960
SCENARIO. AND THIS IS MANDATORY

04:53:31.026 --> 04:53:33.395
PARTICIPATION. SO REMOVING THAT

04:53:33.462 --> 04:53:36.598
CHOICE TO TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

04:53:36.665 --> 04:53:38.567
PROGRAM AND THEN ALSO REMOVE

04:53:38.634 --> 04:53:40.002
THE PAYMENT CAP. AND YOU CAN

04:53:40.069 --> 04:53:43.138
SEE UNDER THIS SCENARIO REC

04:53:43.205 --> 04:53:44.406
REVENUE GOES UP DRAMATICALLY

04:53:44.473 --> 04:53:46.542
WHILE THE ANNUAL FEE REVENUE

04:53:46.608 --> 04:53:48.877
GOES WAY DOWN. AND I'LL JUST

04:53:48.944 --> 04:53:50.179
POINT OUT THAT UNDER THIS

04:53:50.245 --> 04:53:52.147
SCENARIO, EVS WOULD NOT BE

04:53:52.214 --> 04:53:52.948
REQUIRED TO JOIN THE RUCK

04:53:53.015 --> 04:53:55.117
PROGRAM UNTIL AFTER THE FIRST

04:53:55.184 --> 04:53:57.820
YEAR. SO THAT'S WHY YOU STILL

04:53:57.886 --> 04:53:58.454
SEE THAT ANNUAL FEE GENERATING

04:53:58.520 --> 04:54:00.155
SOME REVENUE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE

04:54:00.222 --> 04:54:03.125
THE FIRST YEAR EV OWNERS PAYING

04:54:03.192 --> 04:54:05.194
THE ANNUAL FEE, AND THEN THEY

04:54:05.260 --> 04:54:07.963
TRANSITION TO THE RUCK PROGRAM

04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:12.167
ON YEAR TWO. AND THAT'S REALLY

04:54:12.234 --> 04:54:15.170
ALL I HAVE TO WITH REGARDS TO

04:54:15.237 --> 04:54:16.739
THE UTAH PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE

04:54:16.805 --> 04:54:19.174
THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO

04:54:19.241 --> 04:54:20.943
MUCH. I HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF

04:54:21.010 --> 04:54:22.578
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. YOU NOTED

04:54:22.644 --> 04:54:24.313
THAT THE MILEAGE BASED FEES IS

04:54:24.380 --> 04:54:27.149
IS A PAY AS YOU GO SYSTEM, VERY

04:54:27.216 --> 04:54:29.284
SIMILAR TO HOW WE DO THAT. WHEN

04:54:29.351 --> 04:54:30.986
YOU HAVE A GAS TAX THAT'S PAY

04:54:31.053 --> 04:54:33.188
AS YOU GO. SO HOW OFTEN ARE

04:54:33.255 --> 04:54:34.023
THEY SENDING IN THE ODOMETER

04:54:34.089 --> 04:54:37.226
PHOTOS OR TELEMATICS WHEN WHEN

04:54:37.292 --> 04:54:39.328
THEY'RE USING THE MILEAGE BASED

04:54:39.395 --> 04:54:42.531
FEE VERSUS THE ANNUAL FLAT ONE.

04:54:42.598 --> 04:54:44.333
YEAH. GREAT QUESTION. SO

04:54:44.400 --> 04:54:46.201
ORIGINALLY IN THE PROGRAM WE

04:54:46.268 --> 04:54:49.638
DID THAT EVERY ON A MONTHLY

04:54:49.705 --> 04:54:52.241
BASIS. AND WE KIND OF

04:54:52.307 --> 04:54:55.110
RECOGNIZED THAT, YOU KNOW, AND

04:54:55.177 --> 04:54:57.312
WE GOT FEEDBACK FROM USERS THAT,

04:54:57.379 --> 04:54:59.181
YOU KNOW, THAT THEY'D BE OKAY

04:54:59.248 --> 04:55:00.883
GOING TO A QUARTERLY BASIS. AND

04:55:00.949 --> 04:55:02.484
THAT ALSO LOWERED OUR

04:55:02.551 --> 04:55:04.853
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS GOING TO A

04:55:04.920 --> 04:55:06.121
QUARTERLY BASIS. AND SO THAT'S

04:55:06.188 --> 04:55:08.490
THAT'S THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS

04:55:08.557 --> 04:55:13.095
IT'S A QUARTERLY HIT AS FAR AS

04:55:13.162 --> 04:55:15.064
WHEN YOU'RE PAYING. AND AND

04:55:15.130 --> 04:55:18.167
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE DO. THANK

04:55:18.233 --> 04:55:22.104
YOU. AND THEN FINALLY FOR THE

04:55:22.171 --> 04:55:25.040
YOU MENTIONED ON THE REPORTING

04:55:25.107 --> 04:55:26.842
OPTION SELECTION SIDE ABOUT

04:55:26.909 --> 04:55:29.278
PRIVACY, PERSONAL DATA PRIVACY

04:55:29.344 --> 04:55:30.079
AND PEOPLE BEING CONCERNED. AND

04:55:30.145 --> 04:55:33.248
YOU'RE ONLY COLLECTING THE VIN

04:55:33.315 --> 04:55:36.251
NUMBER AND THE ODOMETER. BUT

04:55:36.318 --> 04:55:38.787
YOU ALSO NOTED THAT YOU KEEP

04:55:38.854 --> 04:55:40.622
THE INFORMATION FOR A CERTAIN

04:55:40.689 --> 04:55:41.924
AMOUNT OF TIME. WHAT'S FEASIBLE.

04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:44.126
DO YOU COULD YOU SHARE LIKE HOW

04:55:44.193 --> 04:55:45.360
MUCH TIME ARE YOU KEEPING IT?

04:55:45.427 --> 04:55:47.729
AND IS IT RELATED TO HOW MUCH

04:55:47.796 --> 04:55:48.664
TIME GOVERNMENT KEEPS THINGS

04:55:48.730 --> 04:55:50.399
FOR AN AUDIT? OR HOW DOES THAT

04:55:50.466 --> 04:55:52.568
GET RECONCILED? YEAH, WE

04:55:52.634 --> 04:55:55.971
ACTUALLY. HAVE THE ABILITY TO

04:55:56.038 --> 04:55:59.808
TO DELETE THAT WITHIN 30 DAYS.

04:55:59.875 --> 04:56:04.947
IF. IF IS APPROPRIATE. AND

04:56:05.013 --> 04:56:07.282
SOMETIMES WE'LL KEEP IT FOR UP

04:56:07.349 --> 04:56:09.084
TO 90 DAYS. JUST, JUST MAKING

04:56:09.151 --> 04:56:12.421
SURE THAT HEY, YEAH, IT IS PAID

04:56:12.488 --> 04:56:15.657
AND THERE'S NO DISPUTES. AND SO

04:56:15.724 --> 04:56:17.025
I'D SAY BETWEEN 30 AND 90 DAYS

04:56:17.092 --> 04:56:19.194
IS GENERALLY HOW LONG WE KEEP

04:56:19.261 --> 04:56:20.295
THE INFORMATION. AND THEN WE

04:56:20.362 --> 04:56:22.064
GET RID OF THAT AS SOON AS WE

04:56:22.131 --> 04:56:24.166
CAN. OKAY. SO IT IS BASED ON

04:56:24.233 --> 04:56:26.568
BASICALLY A DISPUTE. SO IF

04:56:26.635 --> 04:56:27.136
SOMEONE DOESN'T DISPUTE PAYS

04:56:27.202 --> 04:56:29.171
THE BILL THEN IT'S DELETED. BUT

04:56:29.238 --> 04:56:31.273
IF IT IS A DISPUTE THEN THAT

04:56:31.340 --> 04:56:32.174
PERSON'S RETAINED TO TO RESOLVE

04:56:32.241 --> 04:56:35.210
THE DISPUTE. YEP. AND AS SOON

04:56:35.277 --> 04:56:36.011
AS THAT'S RESOLVED WE CAN WE

04:56:36.078 --> 04:56:38.480
CAN GO AHEAD AND GET RID OF

04:56:38.547 --> 04:56:41.650
THAT OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU.

04:56:41.717 --> 04:56:43.252
ALL RIGHT. AND THEN ONE ONE

04:56:43.318 --> 04:56:45.954
MORE FOR YOU I'M GOING TO ASK

04:56:46.021 --> 04:56:48.290
THIS OF OTHERS IF IT'S RELEVANT.

04:56:48.357 --> 04:56:50.559
AND YOU ALL CHOSE PARTICULARLY

04:56:50.626 --> 04:56:53.228
TO FOCUS ON EVS WITH THE

04:56:53.295 --> 04:56:55.631
EVENTUAL ADOPTION OF EVERYONE.

04:56:55.697 --> 04:56:58.834
BUT WHY CHOOSE? WHY START WITH

04:56:58.901 --> 04:57:01.737
A RUCK VERSUS THE KILOWATT HOUR

04:57:01.803 --> 04:57:05.407
CHARGE? OKAY, SURE. THANK YOU.

04:57:05.474 --> 04:57:08.677
WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE A KILOWATT

04:57:08.744 --> 04:57:13.382
PER HOUR. WELL, WE HAVE A A

04:57:13.448 --> 04:57:16.351
CHARGING TAX. SO IT'S 12.5% OF

04:57:16.418 --> 04:57:20.656
THE PRICE OF CHARGING AT A

04:57:20.722 --> 04:57:23.192
PRIVATE VENDOR. SO YOU KNOW, IF

04:57:23.258 --> 04:57:24.993
YOU CHARGE YOUR EV AT HOME OF

04:57:25.060 --> 04:57:26.528
COURSE YOU'RE NOT PAYING THIS

04:57:26.595 --> 04:57:27.362
TAX. BUT IF YOU'RE FILLING UP

04:57:27.429 --> 04:57:30.065
AT A, AT A CHARGING PLACE, A

04:57:30.132 --> 04:57:31.266
PRIVATE CHARGING PLACE, THEN

04:57:31.333 --> 04:57:33.168
THEN WE DO HAVE THAT TAX.

04:57:33.235 --> 04:57:35.170
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M LOOKING ON

04:57:35.237 --> 04:57:36.438
OUR LITTLE ON OUR LITTLE OTHER

04:57:36.505 --> 04:57:38.040
SHEET THAT TOLD US ALL THE

04:57:38.106 --> 04:57:40.676
STATES OKAY. GO AHEAD. KEEP

04:57:40.742 --> 04:57:44.580
GOING WITH WITH REGARDS TO AND

04:57:44.646 --> 04:57:45.914
REALLY THE MAIN REASON WE DO

04:57:45.981 --> 04:57:49.084
THAT IS WE RECOGNIZE THAT MANY

04:57:49.151 --> 04:57:52.054
LOCALS WILL CHARGE AT AT HOME.

04:57:52.120 --> 04:57:55.891
AND SO THE, THE FOLKS THAT WE,

04:57:55.958 --> 04:57:58.093
WE FELT LIKE THERE WAS A LITTLE

04:57:58.160 --> 04:57:59.828
GAP WAS FOLKS COMING IN FROM

04:57:59.895 --> 04:58:02.064
OUT OF STATE. I DRIVE AN EV, I

04:58:02.130 --> 04:58:05.000
DROVE DOWN TO, TO ARIZONA. AND

04:58:05.067 --> 04:58:07.536
SO EV DRIVERS, THEY DO GO ON

04:58:07.603 --> 04:58:09.905
ROAD TRIPS. THEY GET AROUND AND

04:58:09.972 --> 04:58:12.841
AND SO WHEN FOLKS COME INTO THE

04:58:12.908 --> 04:58:15.010
STATE, WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO

04:58:15.077 --> 04:58:17.512
COLLECT A TAX ON ON THOSE FOLKS

04:58:17.579 --> 04:58:18.313
AS THEY CHARGE UP THEIR

04:58:18.380 --> 04:58:20.048
VEHICLES. WE FELT LIKE THAT WAS

04:58:20.115 --> 04:58:21.250
A GAP IN OUR SYSTEM WITH

04:58:21.316 --> 04:58:24.052
REGARDS TO STARTING WITH EVS ON

04:58:24.119 --> 04:58:26.355
ON THE RUCK, OF COURSE, IT JUST,

04:58:26.421 --> 04:58:28.056
YOU KNOW, IT MADE SENSE BECAUSE

04:58:28.123 --> 04:58:30.225
THEY'RE THE FOLKS THAT AREN'T

04:58:30.292 --> 04:58:32.327
ALREADY PAYING A, A GAS TAX.

04:58:32.394 --> 04:58:35.797
AND AND HAVING THAT ANNUAL FEE

04:58:35.864 --> 04:58:37.099
PROVIDED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

04:58:37.165 --> 04:58:39.968
DO THAT VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WHERE

04:58:40.035 --> 04:58:42.104
THEY CAN CHOOSE ONE OR THE

04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:43.272
OTHER. SO THANK YOU. ONE FOLLOW

04:58:43.338 --> 04:58:45.274
UP QUESTION, YOU NOTED THAT YOU

04:58:45.340 --> 04:58:47.976
DO CHARGE IT ON THE PUBLIC

04:58:48.043 --> 04:58:49.211
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

04:58:49.278 --> 04:58:51.246
STATE OF UTAH. DO YOU ALL FUND

04:58:51.313 --> 04:58:52.881
THE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE

04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:56.184
RELATED TO EV AS A PART OF THE

04:58:56.251 --> 04:58:57.953
WORK THAT YOU DO, OR IS IT

04:58:58.020 --> 04:59:01.023
PRIMARILY RELIED ON BY, LIKE,

04:59:01.089 --> 04:59:03.225
FOR INSTANCE, TESLA CHARGING OR

04:59:03.292 --> 04:59:05.661
COMPANIES THAT CHARGE A FEE

04:59:05.727 --> 04:59:06.295
THAT CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE

04:59:06.361 --> 04:59:07.929
AND THEN CHARGE A FEE ON TOP OF

04:59:07.996 --> 04:59:10.332
THAT? YEAH. SO WE GENERALLY

04:59:10.399 --> 04:59:11.433
DON'T PROVIDE THE

04:59:11.500 --> 04:59:13.101
INFRASTRUCTURE OTHER THAN THE

04:59:13.168 --> 04:59:15.971
NAVY, THE FEDERAL NAVY PROGRAM.

04:59:16.038 --> 04:59:19.241
AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY QUICK TO

04:59:19.308 --> 04:59:20.942
TRY TO SPEND THAT MONEY. AND SO

04:59:21.009 --> 04:59:23.578
WE ARE PUTTING IN CHARGING

04:59:23.645 --> 04:59:25.614
STATIONS WITH THAT, THAT

04:59:25.681 --> 04:59:32.387
FEDERAL MONEY. WE DO. WE DON'T.

04:59:32.454 --> 04:59:34.056
THOSE ARE BASICALLY TURNED OVER

04:59:34.122 --> 04:59:37.292
TO PRIVATE ENTITIES TO RUN THEM.

04:59:37.359 --> 04:59:39.361
SO YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WE DON'T

04:59:39.428 --> 04:59:41.463
HOLD ON TO THOSE. BUT THAT'S

04:59:41.530 --> 04:59:43.598
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE DO

04:59:43.665 --> 04:59:46.601
BUILD. SO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU

04:59:46.668 --> 04:59:49.638
SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT. NOW WE WILL

04:59:49.705 --> 04:59:51.907
MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER

04:59:51.973 --> 05:00:04.486
SCOTT BOARDMAN. OKAY. GREAT.

05:00:04.553 --> 05:00:06.421
FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS SCOTT

05:00:06.488 --> 05:00:08.090
BOARDMAN. I SERVE AS THE

05:00:08.156 --> 05:00:09.324
INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS POLICY

05:00:09.391 --> 05:00:10.058
ADVISOR WITH THE OREGON

05:00:10.125 --> 05:00:12.060
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION,

05:00:12.127 --> 05:00:13.729
AND I WILL TRY AND MOVE THROUGH

05:00:13.795 --> 05:00:15.497
THIS PRESENTATION RELATIVELY

05:00:15.564 --> 05:00:18.900
QUICKLY. SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

05:00:18.967 --> 05:00:21.436
SO I USUALLY LIKE TO KIND OF

05:00:21.503 --> 05:00:22.971
SET THE SCENE IN TERMS OF

05:00:23.038 --> 05:00:24.206
OREGON STRUCTURAL FUNDING

05:00:24.272 --> 05:00:25.307
CHALLENGES WHEN GIVING THIS

05:00:25.374 --> 05:00:27.976
TYPE OF PRESENTATION MIGHT NOT

05:00:28.043 --> 05:00:30.045
BE AS NECESSARY THIS EVENING,

05:00:30.112 --> 05:00:31.246
GIVEN THE PRESENTATIONS THAT

05:00:31.313 --> 05:00:32.013
HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE ME. I

05:00:32.080 --> 05:00:34.149
THINK WE ALL KNOW AT THIS POINT

05:00:34.216 --> 05:00:36.585
THAT FUEL TAX REVENUE IS ON THE

05:00:36.651 --> 05:00:37.152
DECLINE AS VEHICLES BECOME

05:00:37.219 --> 05:00:38.120
INCREASINGLY EFFICIENT, WHILE

05:00:38.186 --> 05:00:40.522
WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH

05:00:40.589 --> 05:00:41.957
CHALLENGES RELATED TO INFLATION

05:00:42.023 --> 05:00:44.793
AS IT RELATES TO LABOR,

05:00:44.860 --> 05:00:45.427
MATERIALS, CONSTRUCTION, ALL OF

05:00:45.494 --> 05:00:47.162
THOSE THINGS. SO IT'S KIND OF

05:00:47.229 --> 05:00:49.231
THIS ONE TWO PUNCH THAT'S

05:00:49.297 --> 05:00:52.000
AFFECTING THE GAS TAX AND THE

05:00:52.067 --> 05:00:53.702
INVESTMENT THAT WE CAN MAKE IN

05:00:53.769 --> 05:00:55.604
OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO

05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:58.407
FOR OREGON, WE DO NOT USE

05:00:58.473 --> 05:00:59.941
INFLATION RESISTANT FUNDING

05:01:00.008 --> 05:01:02.210
MECHANISMS. AND I THINK MAYBE

05:01:02.277 --> 05:01:04.513
THE ONE UNIQUE THING ON THIS

05:01:04.579 --> 05:01:05.447
SLIDE MIGHT BE OUR STATUTORY

05:01:05.514 --> 05:01:07.149
DIRECTION IN THE SENSE THAT FOR

05:01:07.215 --> 05:01:10.285
THOSE DMV FEES, REGISTRATION,

05:01:10.352 --> 05:01:12.087
TITLE FEES, THINGS ALONG THOSE

05:01:12.154 --> 05:01:14.222
LINES, ABOUT 75% OF THAT GOES

05:01:14.289 --> 05:01:15.090
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, STATE

05:01:15.157 --> 05:01:17.292
HIGHWAY PROJECTS AND OTHER

05:01:17.359 --> 05:01:18.160
PROGRAMS AND AREN'T ACTUALLY

05:01:18.226 --> 05:01:20.061
SPENT ON ON DELIVERING DMV

05:01:20.128 --> 05:01:22.330
SERVICES. AND THEN OUR LAST OR

05:01:22.397 --> 05:01:25.066
OUR MOST RECENT LARGE

05:01:25.133 --> 05:01:26.935
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PACKAGE

05:01:27.002 --> 05:01:29.571
WAS IN 2017, AND THAT BILL WAS

05:01:29.638 --> 05:01:31.339
HB 2017, VERY, VERY UNIQUE IN

05:01:31.406 --> 05:01:33.208
TERMS OF ITS NAMING. AS YOU CAN

05:01:33.275 --> 05:01:35.310
SEE HERE, LESS THAN 3% OF THE

05:01:35.377 --> 05:01:37.679
TAXES FROM THAT PROJECT, FROM

05:01:37.746 --> 05:01:39.514
THAT BILL WENT TO HIGHWAY

05:01:39.581 --> 05:01:40.081
MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS.

05:01:40.148 --> 05:01:41.950
THAT WAS A VERY PROJECT HEAVY

05:01:42.017 --> 05:01:43.618
PACKAGE. AND SO WE ARE NOW

05:01:43.685 --> 05:01:45.253
FACING A BIG CHALLENGE AS IT

05:01:45.320 --> 05:01:48.557
RELATES TO O&amp;M FOR OUR

05:01:48.623 --> 05:01:50.492
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. NEXT

05:01:50.559 --> 05:01:54.296
SLIDE. SO HOW DOES OREGON

05:01:54.362 --> 05:01:56.198
DIFFER AND HOW IS OREGON THE

05:01:56.264 --> 05:01:58.300
SAME FROM OTHERS? YOU KNOW, I

05:01:58.366 --> 05:02:01.036
THINK TWO THINGS UNIQUE TO OUR

05:02:01.102 --> 05:02:02.237
STATE THAT MANY OTHER STATES

05:02:02.304 --> 05:02:04.039
DON'T HAVE IS THE IDEA OF COST

05:02:04.105 --> 05:02:06.074
RESPONSIBILITY BUILT INTO OUR

05:02:06.141 --> 05:02:07.242
CONSTITUTION. AND SO THAT

05:02:07.309 --> 05:02:08.210
BASICALLY REQUIRES EACH

05:02:08.276 --> 05:02:10.011
CATEGORY OF HIGHWAY USER TO

05:02:10.078 --> 05:02:11.847
CONTRIBUTE TO OR CONTRIBUTE

05:02:11.913 --> 05:02:15.116
REVENUES IN PROPORTION TO THE

05:02:15.183 --> 05:02:16.418
COST THAT THEY IMPOSE ON THE

05:02:16.485 --> 05:02:18.086
SYSTEM. SO BASICALLY, YOU'RE

05:02:18.153 --> 05:02:19.321
LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, ENSURING

05:02:19.387 --> 05:02:20.822
THAT LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY

05:02:20.889 --> 05:02:22.123
VEHICLES ARE PAYING IN

05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:24.493
PROPORTION TO THE COST THAT

05:02:24.559 --> 05:02:25.894
THEY IMPOSE, AND THEN ALSO THE

05:02:25.961 --> 05:02:27.195
WEIGHT MILE TAX, WHERE HEAVY

05:02:27.262 --> 05:02:29.231
DUTY VEHICLES IN OREGON DO NOT

05:02:29.297 --> 05:02:32.100
PAY DIESEL TAX, THEY PAY BASED

05:02:32.167 --> 05:02:34.469
ON THEIR WEIGHT AND THE AMOUNT

05:02:34.536 --> 05:02:36.137
THAT THEY DRIVE IN THE STATE.

05:02:36.204 --> 05:02:38.240
SO THOSE ARE TWO UNIQUE ITEMS

05:02:38.306 --> 05:02:39.975
FOR US AS IT RELATES TO OUR

05:02:40.041 --> 05:02:42.043
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING MIX,

05:02:42.110 --> 05:02:43.812
THINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT

05:02:43.879 --> 05:02:46.448
MANY OTHER STATES DO IS

05:02:46.515 --> 05:02:48.250
INDEXING OF THE GAS TAX OR

05:02:48.316 --> 05:02:50.085
OTHER FEES, SUCH AS

05:02:50.151 --> 05:02:52.153
REGISTRATION FEES, TOLLING ON

05:02:52.220 --> 05:02:54.489
STATE HIGHWAYS. OREGON DOES NOT

05:02:54.556 --> 05:02:56.258
HAVE A GENERAL SALES TAX, AND

05:02:56.324 --> 05:02:59.160
SO IN MANY OTHER STATES THAT DO

05:02:59.227 --> 05:03:00.295
HAVE A SALES TAX, LOCAL

05:03:00.362 --> 05:03:02.364
GOVERNMENTS, YOU KNOW, MIGHT

05:03:02.430 --> 05:03:05.133
MIGHT IMPOSE A LOCAL OPTION

05:03:05.200 --> 05:03:06.701
SALES TAX THAT MIGHT HELP PAY

05:03:06.768 --> 05:03:08.003
FOR FOR TRANSPORTATION AT THE

05:03:08.069 --> 05:03:10.138
LOCAL LEVEL. WE DO NOT HAVE

05:03:10.205 --> 05:03:11.206
THAT. SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

05:03:11.273 --> 05:03:13.241
HEAVILY RELIANT ON THE STATE.

05:03:13.308 --> 05:03:14.910
WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL THE 50,

05:03:14.976 --> 05:03:17.546
3020 SPLIT, WHERE THE STATE

05:03:17.612 --> 05:03:20.215
RETAINS 50% OF THE REVENUES AND

05:03:20.282 --> 05:03:22.384
THEN GIVES 30% TO THE COUNTIES

05:03:22.450 --> 05:03:24.586
AND 20% TO THE CITIES. SO THE

05:03:24.653 --> 05:03:26.054
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE VERY

05:03:26.121 --> 05:03:28.456
RELIANT ON A HEALTHY STATE

05:03:28.523 --> 05:03:30.892
HIGHWAY FUND FOR THEM TO MAKE

05:03:30.959 --> 05:03:32.427
THEIR OWN INVESTMENTS. AND THEN

05:03:32.494 --> 05:03:33.995
GENERALLY, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY

05:03:34.062 --> 05:03:35.263
GENERAL FUND OR OTHER NON-USER

05:03:35.330 --> 05:03:37.165
FEE FUNDS. WE DID HAVE A

05:03:37.232 --> 05:03:38.967
TRANSFER FROM THE GENERAL FUND.

05:03:39.034 --> 05:03:40.201
I THINK THAT WAS A SPECIAL

05:03:40.268 --> 05:03:43.138
SESSION AT THE END OF 2024, AND

05:03:43.204 --> 05:03:45.273
THAT WAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

05:03:45.340 --> 05:03:47.542
DECISION THAT WAS MADE, BECAUSE

05:03:47.609 --> 05:03:48.476
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TYPICAL

05:03:48.543 --> 05:03:50.445
FOR THE STATE OF OREGON. NEXT

05:03:50.512 --> 05:03:54.516
SLIDE. AND SO WE YOU KNOW, FROM

05:03:54.583 --> 05:03:55.116
FROM ODOT'S PERSPECTIVE, THIS

05:03:55.183 --> 05:03:56.151
IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

05:03:56.217 --> 05:03:58.186
BANGING THE DRUM FOR A WHILE ON

05:03:58.253 --> 05:03:59.988
OF, OF THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW,

05:04:00.055 --> 05:04:01.256
WITHIN OUR TRANSPORTATION

05:04:01.323 --> 05:04:03.491
FUNDING MIX, WE HAVE KIND OF

05:04:03.558 --> 05:04:04.392
THIS THREE LEGGED STOOL AND ONE

05:04:04.459 --> 05:04:06.227
OF THE LEGS IS ABOUT TO FALL

05:04:06.294 --> 05:04:08.196
OFF. THAT'S THE GAS TAX.

05:04:08.263 --> 05:04:09.898
ANOTHER LEG IS A LITTLE WOBBLY,

05:04:09.965 --> 05:04:11.466
AS I MENTIONED, IN THE SENSE

05:04:11.533 --> 05:04:13.234
THAT DMVS FEES OFTEN GO TO

05:04:13.301 --> 05:04:14.970
OTHER PROJECTS OR OTHER

05:04:15.036 --> 05:04:17.205
INVESTMENTS. AND THEN THE MOTOR

05:04:17.272 --> 05:04:19.140
CARRIER ELEMENT IS THE WAIT

05:04:19.207 --> 05:04:20.241
MILE TAX FOR THE HEAVY DUTY

05:04:20.308 --> 05:04:22.310
VEHICLES. AND SO WHAT WE REALLY

05:04:22.377 --> 05:04:23.478
SEE IS THIS ROADMAP TO

05:04:23.545 --> 05:04:25.347
FINANCIAL STABILITY.

05:04:25.413 --> 05:04:26.381
SUSTAINABILITY INCLUDES VARIOUS

05:04:26.448 --> 05:04:30.719
OTHER FEES, SUCH AS, YOU KNOW,

05:04:30.785 --> 05:04:31.886
INDEXING THOSE TO INFLATION,

05:04:31.953 --> 05:04:34.089
USER FEES, WHICH I THINK, YOU

05:04:34.155 --> 05:04:35.323
KNOW, WE'LL GET INTO IN TERMS

05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:37.025
OF THE IDEA OF A ROAD USAGE

05:04:37.092 --> 05:04:38.159
CHARGE AND POTENTIALLY GENERAL

05:04:38.226 --> 05:04:40.228
FUND SOURCES IN THE FUTURE AS

05:04:40.295 --> 05:04:41.129
NECESSARY, BUT IT'S NOT

05:04:41.196 --> 05:04:43.264
SOMETHING WE NECESSARILY WANT

05:04:43.331 --> 05:04:46.401
TO RELY UPON. BUT THIS IS YOU

05:04:46.468 --> 05:04:48.069
KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH

05:04:48.136 --> 05:04:49.371
THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS

05:04:49.437 --> 05:04:51.039
TO REALLY EXPLORE WHAT THOSE

05:04:51.106 --> 05:04:53.274
NEW OR DIVERSIFIED FUNDING

05:04:53.341 --> 05:04:55.977
STREAMS MIGHT BE TO TO TRY AND

05:04:56.044 --> 05:04:58.446
SHORE UP THE AGENCY'S BUDGET

05:04:58.513 --> 05:05:01.149
AND ITS O&amp;M INVESTMENTS. NEXT

05:05:01.216 --> 05:05:06.154
SLIDE PLEASE. SO, YOU KNOW, IN

05:05:06.221 --> 05:05:07.889
SOME WAYS THIS ECHOES A LITTLE

05:05:07.956 --> 05:05:09.457
BIT WHAT WHAT UTAH HAD

05:05:09.524 --> 05:05:11.159
DESCRIBED. WE HAD CREATED A

05:05:11.226 --> 05:05:12.093
TASK FORCE, I THINK I THINK

05:05:12.160 --> 05:05:14.095
LIFE SAID THEIRS WAS 2003. SO

05:05:14.162 --> 05:05:16.164
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE BEAT THEM BY

05:05:16.231 --> 05:05:17.132
TWO YEARS, BUT WE HAVE WHAT'S

05:05:17.198 --> 05:05:19.134
KNOWN AS THE ROAD USER FEE TASK

05:05:19.200 --> 05:05:20.301
FORCE, WHAT WE LOVINGLY CALL

05:05:20.368 --> 05:05:21.903
ROUGH TOUGH THAT WAS CREATED BY

05:05:21.970 --> 05:05:24.105
THE LEGISLATURE IN 2001,

05:05:24.172 --> 05:05:25.940
LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO THE

05:05:26.007 --> 05:05:27.242
EMERGENCE OF HYBRID VEHICLES

05:05:27.308 --> 05:05:29.177
THAT THE LEGISLATURE KIND OF

05:05:29.244 --> 05:05:30.712
RECOGNIZED THAT AS VEHICLES

05:05:30.779 --> 05:05:31.246
WERE BECOMING INCREASINGLY

05:05:31.312 --> 05:05:33.081
EFFICIENT, THAT THE GAS TAX WAS

05:05:33.148 --> 05:05:35.016
NOT GOING TO BE A LONG TERM,

05:05:35.083 --> 05:05:37.218
SUSTAINABLE OPTION FOR RAISING

05:05:37.285 --> 05:05:38.853
REVENUE. AND SO THEY WERE

05:05:38.920 --> 05:05:41.022
GUIDED BY EIGHT OVERARCHING

05:05:41.089 --> 05:05:42.290
CRITERIA. THOSE THINGS INCLUDED,

05:05:42.357 --> 05:05:43.958
YOU KNOW, ONE THEME THAT WE'VE

05:05:44.025 --> 05:05:45.326
HEARD A LOT TONIGHT, WHICH IS,

05:05:45.393 --> 05:05:47.228
YOU KNOW, THE USER PAY

05:05:47.295 --> 05:05:48.963
PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS REVENUE

05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:50.465
SUFFICIENCY. AND THEY

05:05:50.532 --> 05:05:52.300
CONSIDERED ROUGHLY 28 FUNDING

05:05:52.367 --> 05:05:55.136
IDEAS. MANY OF THESE WERE TAXES

05:05:55.203 --> 05:05:57.005
ON SPECIFIC ITEMS. AGAIN,

05:05:57.072 --> 05:05:58.940
OREGON DOES NOT HAVE A GENERAL

05:05:59.007 --> 05:06:00.241
SALES TAX. THEY WERE LOOKING AT

05:06:00.308 --> 05:06:02.410
TAXES ON THINGS LIKE BATTERIES

05:06:02.477 --> 05:06:05.246
OR TIRES, BUT FOUND THAT, YOU

05:06:05.313 --> 05:06:07.348
KNOW, THE IDEA THAT IF YOU'RE

05:06:07.415 --> 05:06:08.416
TAXING THOSE SPECIFIC ITEMS,

05:06:08.483 --> 05:06:09.050
THAT MIGHT DISINCENTIVIZE

05:06:09.117 --> 05:06:10.485
SOMEONE FROM PUTTING FOUR NEW

05:06:10.552 --> 05:06:12.153
TIRES ON THEIR CAR AND RUNNING

05:06:12.220 --> 05:06:13.354
THEM TO A POINT WHERE MAYBE

05:06:13.421 --> 05:06:15.256
IT'S UNSAFE. AND SO REALLY

05:06:15.323 --> 05:06:17.092
LOOKING AT ALL THESE GUIDED BY

05:06:17.158 --> 05:06:18.993
THOSE EIGHT CRITERIA, THE IDEA

05:06:19.060 --> 05:06:22.030
THAT REALLY EMERGED WAS ROAD

05:06:22.097 --> 05:06:23.331
USAGE CHARGING. AND SO THAT WAS

05:06:23.398 --> 05:06:24.466
IDENTIFIED AS THE PREFERRED

05:06:24.532 --> 05:06:26.000
ALTERNATIVE. AND THE STATE

05:06:26.067 --> 05:06:28.136
CONDUCTED PILOTS IN 2006 AND

05:06:28.203 --> 05:06:30.438
2012, WHICH BOTH WENT QUITE

05:06:30.505 --> 05:06:31.239
WELL, WHICH LED TO LEGISLATION

05:06:31.306 --> 05:06:35.243
IN 2013 THAT CREATED OUR

05:06:35.310 --> 05:06:37.512
PROGRAM KNOWN AS OREGO IN 2015.

05:06:37.579 --> 05:06:41.049
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND SO

05:06:41.116 --> 05:06:43.518
THE OREGO PROGRAM, WE ARE THE

05:06:43.585 --> 05:06:45.286
FIRST OPERATIONAL PROGRAM IN

05:06:45.353 --> 05:06:48.823
THE NATION WHEN WE WENT LIVE IN

05:06:48.890 --> 05:06:50.892
2015. IT IS VOLUNTARY. VIRGINIA

05:06:50.959 --> 05:06:53.995
AND UTAH HAVE SURPASSED US IN

05:06:54.062 --> 05:06:56.231
TERMS OF ENROLLMENTS, BUT WE

05:06:56.297 --> 05:06:58.133
ARE HOPING THAT OUR NUMBERS GO

05:06:58.199 --> 05:07:00.702
UP SOON. AND I'LL MENTION THAT

05:07:00.769 --> 05:07:02.937
IN A COUPLE OF SLIDES. BUT

05:07:03.004 --> 05:07:04.639
BASICALLY, AT THIS POINT IN THE

05:07:04.706 --> 05:07:06.207
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM, DRIVERS OF

05:07:06.274 --> 05:07:07.075
VEHICLES THAT ARE RATED AT 20

05:07:07.142 --> 05:07:09.711
MPG OR BETTER CAN ENROLL. THE

05:07:09.778 --> 05:07:12.046
RATE IS SET AT 5% OF THE FUEL

05:07:12.113 --> 05:07:15.450
TAX IN LAW. CURRENTLY, OUR PER

05:07:15.517 --> 05:07:17.452
GALLON FUEL TAX IS $0.40, WHICH

05:07:17.519 --> 05:07:20.321
PUTS THE RATE AT $0.02 PER MILE.

05:07:20.388 --> 05:07:21.990
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS IDEA

05:07:22.056 --> 05:07:23.825
OF FUEL TAX AND RUCK. THERE'S

05:07:23.892 --> 05:07:26.027
CONCERN ABOUT DOUBLE TAXATION

05:07:26.094 --> 05:07:28.496
FOR ANY VEHICLE THAT STILL USES

05:07:28.563 --> 05:07:30.031
GASOLINE OR, YOU KNOW, OTHER

05:07:30.098 --> 05:07:32.100
TAXABLE FUEL. THEY RECEIVE A

05:07:32.167 --> 05:07:33.968
CREDIT FOR ANY FUEL TAX PAID,

05:07:34.035 --> 05:07:35.069
AND THEY ONLY PAY THE

05:07:35.136 --> 05:07:36.671
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT

05:07:36.738 --> 05:07:37.939
THEY OWE AND RUCK VERSUS WHAT

05:07:38.006 --> 05:07:39.107
THEY'VE ALREADY PAID IN FUEL

05:07:39.174 --> 05:07:40.208
TAX. OBVIOUSLY, THAT DOESN'T

05:07:40.275 --> 05:07:42.243
APPLY TO EVS BECAUSE THEY ARE

05:07:42.310 --> 05:07:45.046
NOT PAYING FUEL TAX IN ADDITION,

05:07:45.113 --> 05:07:46.781
IN ANY WAY IN ADDITION TO THE

05:07:46.848 --> 05:07:49.684
RUCK. SO IN OREGON WE HAVE A

05:07:49.751 --> 05:07:50.418
TIERED REGISTRATION STRUCTURE

05:07:50.485 --> 05:07:53.321
WHERE VEHICLES PAY AN

05:07:53.388 --> 05:07:54.289
ADDITIONAL AMOUNT, SUPPLEMENTAL

05:07:54.355 --> 05:07:55.423
REGISTRATION FEE BASED ON THEIR

05:07:55.490 --> 05:07:57.158
EFFICIENCY. AND SO THE VEHICLES

05:07:57.225 --> 05:07:59.194
THAT ARE RATED AT 40 PLUS MPG,

05:07:59.260 --> 05:08:03.464
AS WELL AS EVS, DO NOT HAVE TO

05:08:03.531 --> 05:08:04.132
PAY THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL

05:08:04.199 --> 05:08:05.366
REGISTRATION FEES IF THEY

05:08:05.433 --> 05:08:07.202
ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM. SO

05:08:07.268 --> 05:08:09.370
INSTEAD OF PAYING AT LEAST FOR

05:08:09.437 --> 05:08:12.173
EVS, IT'S CURRENTLY SET AT $115

05:08:12.240 --> 05:08:13.942
PER YEAR. INSTEAD OF PAYING 115

05:08:14.008 --> 05:08:15.109
AT REGISTRATION, THEY CAN

05:08:15.176 --> 05:08:16.277
ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM AND

05:08:16.344 --> 05:08:18.246
SIMPLY PAY BY THE MILE. THEY

05:08:18.313 --> 05:08:21.149
ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM ACCOUNT

05:08:21.216 --> 05:08:23.918
MANAGERS. THEY ARE BUSINESS

05:08:23.985 --> 05:08:26.588
PARTNERS, PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT

05:08:26.654 --> 05:08:28.523
WE CERTIFY THAT THAT PROVIDE

05:08:28.590 --> 05:08:30.391
THOSE SERVICES TO THE

05:08:30.458 --> 05:08:33.061
PARTICIPANTS. AND SO AMONG THE

05:08:33.127 --> 05:08:35.730
ACCOUNT MANAGERS, PARTICIPANTS

05:08:35.797 --> 05:08:37.165
GET TO CHOOSE BETWEEN DIFFERENT

05:08:37.232 --> 05:08:39.067
MILEAGE REPORTING OPTIONS,

05:08:39.133 --> 05:08:40.935
SIMILAR TO WHAT LAITH FROM UTAH

05:08:41.002 --> 05:08:42.470
WAS MENTIONING IN TERMS OF

05:08:42.537 --> 05:08:45.506
ODOMETER CAPTURE WITH YOUR

05:08:45.573 --> 05:08:49.510
PHONE TELEMATICS, OR THE OBD2

05:08:49.577 --> 05:08:50.378
PLUG IN DEVICE THAT WE ARE

05:08:50.445 --> 05:08:51.946
TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE

05:08:52.013 --> 05:08:54.048
PLUG IN DEVICE, AS THOSE ARE

05:08:54.115 --> 05:08:56.017
MORE EXPENSIVE, CAN BE

05:08:56.084 --> 05:08:57.585
CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE TO INSTALL

05:08:57.652 --> 05:08:58.820
IN THE VEHICLE, AND THEN ALSO

05:08:58.887 --> 05:09:00.154
SUBJECT TO, YOU KNOW, ANYBODY

05:09:00.221 --> 05:09:02.257
CAN CAN REMOVE IT AT ANY GIVEN

05:09:02.323 --> 05:09:03.925
TIME AS WELL. SO IT'S NOT

05:09:03.992 --> 05:09:06.060
PARTICULARLY SECURE IN TERMS OF

05:09:06.127 --> 05:09:09.197
A MORE WIDESPREAD OR WIDE SCALE

05:09:09.264 --> 05:09:11.633
PROGRAM. GPS IS NOT REQUIRED,

05:09:11.699 --> 05:09:13.167
THOUGH IT HAS BEEN OFFERED. AND

05:09:13.234 --> 05:09:15.503
SO BASICALLY FOR ANYBODY WHO

05:09:15.570 --> 05:09:18.039
USES THE GPS DEVICE, IF I'M IN

05:09:18.106 --> 05:09:20.475
PORTLAND AND I DRIVE ACROSS THE

05:09:20.541 --> 05:09:21.342
RIVER TO WASHINGTON, IT WOULD

05:09:21.409 --> 05:09:23.711
KNOW AT THAT POINT THAT I DO

05:09:23.778 --> 05:09:25.046
NOT Þ FOR ANY OF THE MILES

05:09:25.113 --> 05:09:26.981
DRIVEN BECAUSE I'M OUT OF STATE.

05:09:27.048 --> 05:09:32.420
NEXT SLIDE. AND SO WE HAVE A

05:09:32.487 --> 05:09:33.221
SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION

05:09:33.288 --> 05:09:34.889
COMING UP AT THE END OF THIS

05:09:34.956 --> 05:09:36.991
WEEK. ONE HAS BEEN CALLED FOR

05:09:37.058 --> 05:09:38.126
AUGUST 29TH, AND THAT IS TO

05:09:38.192 --> 05:09:40.295
ADDRESS ODOT'S BUDGET GAP AND

05:09:40.361 --> 05:09:42.096
STRUCTURAL FUNDING CHALLENGES.

05:09:42.163 --> 05:09:43.932
THIS WAS A BIG TOPIC DURING OUR

05:09:43.998 --> 05:09:45.967
2025 REGULAR SESSION.

05:09:46.034 --> 05:09:47.135
UNFORTUNATELY, A BILL DID NOT

05:09:47.201 --> 05:09:49.771
PASS, AND SO THE AGENCY IS

05:09:49.837 --> 05:09:51.639
FACING SOME SOME SEVERE BUDGET

05:09:51.706 --> 05:09:54.275
CHALLENGES. AND SO THEY ARE

05:09:54.342 --> 05:09:56.844
CONVENING AGAIN THIS FRIDAY.

05:09:56.911 --> 05:09:59.047
THE PROPOSAL, THE FUNDING

05:09:59.113 --> 05:10:00.448
PROPOSAL BEING CONSIDERED WOULD

05:10:00.515 --> 05:10:01.282
INCREASE MANY OF THE

05:10:01.349 --> 05:10:02.216
TRADITIONAL REVENUE SOURCES,

05:10:02.283 --> 05:10:04.185
SUCH AS THE FUELS TAX, VEHICLE

05:10:04.252 --> 05:10:06.154
REGISTRATION AND TITLE FEES, AS

05:10:06.220 --> 05:10:07.121
WELL AS THE PAYROLL TAX, WHICH

05:10:07.188 --> 05:10:09.424
GOES TO TRANSIT PROVIDERS

05:10:09.490 --> 05:10:10.325
ACROSS THE STATE. AND THIS

05:10:10.391 --> 05:10:11.926
LEGISLATION ALSO INCLUDES

05:10:11.993 --> 05:10:13.428
PROVISIONS THAT WOULD CREATE A

05:10:13.494 --> 05:10:15.330
MANDATORY PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN

05:10:15.396 --> 05:10:20.001
VEHICLES. NEXT SLIDE. AND SO AS

05:10:20.068 --> 05:10:22.170
IT RELATES TO THE MANDATORY

05:10:22.236 --> 05:10:25.239
RUCK OR THE POTENTIAL MANDATORY

05:10:25.306 --> 05:10:27.141
RUCK PROGRAM AS THIS, YOU KNOW,

05:10:27.208 --> 05:10:28.676
NOTHING'S SET IN STONE QUITE

05:10:28.743 --> 05:10:30.478
YET. THIS IS THE PROPOSAL

05:10:30.545 --> 05:10:32.146
CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED. SO

05:10:32.213 --> 05:10:35.016
IT BASICALLY PHASE IN FOR

05:10:35.083 --> 05:10:36.117
CERTAIN TYPES OF VEHICLES. OVER

05:10:36.184 --> 05:10:38.453
TIME. IT WOULD BEGIN FIRST WITH

05:10:38.519 --> 05:10:40.621
EVS AT THEIR NEXT REGISTRATION.

05:10:40.688 --> 05:10:43.257
SO EXISTING ALREADY REGISTERED

05:10:43.324 --> 05:10:45.159
EVS BEGINNING IN JULY OF 2027.

05:10:45.226 --> 05:10:47.028
NEW EVS WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT

05:10:47.095 --> 05:10:48.997
JANUARY 1ST OF 2028. YOU MIGHT

05:10:49.063 --> 05:10:50.264
ASK, WHY ARE WE SEPARATING

05:10:50.331 --> 05:10:51.766
THOSE OUT? PART OF THAT IS

05:10:51.833 --> 05:10:52.967
BECAUSE THERE'S ADDITIONAL

05:10:53.034 --> 05:10:55.603
EDUCATION TO BE DONE WITH

05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:57.038
STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS VEHICLE

05:10:57.105 --> 05:11:00.375
DEALERS AND LENDERS. SO CREDIT

05:11:00.441 --> 05:11:02.176
UNIONS AND BANKS, BECAUSE THOSE

05:11:02.243 --> 05:11:04.445
NEW EVS, WHEN YOU'RE PURCHASING

05:11:04.512 --> 05:11:06.180
AT THE DEALERSHIP, THEY WOULD

05:11:06.247 --> 05:11:08.116
NEED TO BE ENROLLED AT THE

05:11:08.182 --> 05:11:09.350
PROGRAM AT THE POINT OF SALE.

05:11:09.417 --> 05:11:11.352
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF AN

05:11:11.419 --> 05:11:13.087
ADDITIONAL PROCESS THAT WE

05:11:13.154 --> 05:11:14.055
FIGURE THAT STARTING WITH THE

05:11:14.122 --> 05:11:16.524
EVS THAT ARE RENEWING THEIR

05:11:16.591 --> 05:11:17.658
REGISTRATION, WHICH THAT'S THAT

05:11:17.725 --> 05:11:18.926
INTERACTION IS ENTIRELY BETWEEN

05:11:18.993 --> 05:11:21.162
THE VEHICLE OWNER AND THE STATE

05:11:21.229 --> 05:11:22.864
WILL PROVIDE A BIT OF AN

05:11:22.930 --> 05:11:24.198
OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THE PROGRAM

05:11:24.265 --> 05:11:26.267
OVER THOSE SIX MONTHS BEFORE

05:11:26.334 --> 05:11:27.969
BRINGING IN THE NEW EVS. AND

05:11:28.036 --> 05:11:29.237
THEN AFTER THAT, WE'D BRING IN

05:11:29.303 --> 05:11:31.239
BOTH NEW AND RENEWAL HYBRIDS.

05:11:31.305 --> 05:11:33.074
SO THAT'S BOTH PLUG IN AND KIND

05:11:33.141 --> 05:11:35.576
OF THE TRADITIONAL HYBRID

05:11:35.643 --> 05:11:37.945
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. IN JULY OF

05:11:38.012 --> 05:11:41.282
2028, I WILL MENTION THAT, YOU

05:11:41.349 --> 05:11:43.051
KNOW, ODOT HAS PROPOSED

05:11:43.117 --> 05:11:44.252
LEGISLATION IN THE PAST THAT

05:11:44.318 --> 05:11:46.487
WOULD HAVE ALSO INCLUDED ANY

05:11:46.554 --> 05:11:48.222
VEHICLES BEGINNING IN A CERTAIN

05:11:48.289 --> 05:11:49.857
YEAR THAT WERE RATED AT 30 MPG

05:11:49.924 --> 05:11:52.427
OR BETTER. SO IT WASN'T JUST

05:11:52.493 --> 05:11:54.529
LIMITED TO ELECTRIC AND HYBRID

05:11:54.595 --> 05:11:56.030
VEHICLES. SO AT LEAST FROM AN

05:11:56.097 --> 05:11:57.231
AGENCY PERSPECTIVE, I CAN'T

05:11:57.298 --> 05:11:58.533
SPEAK TO LEGISLATIVE INTENT.

05:11:58.599 --> 05:12:00.168
BUT WE DO VIEW THIS AS AS KIND

05:12:00.234 --> 05:12:02.203
OF A FIRST STEP IN A MORE

05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:03.404
EXPANDED PROGRAM WHERE

05:12:03.471 --> 05:12:04.972
EFFICIENT ICE VEHICLES WOULD

05:12:05.039 --> 05:12:07.141
ALSO BE SUBJECT AT SOME POINT.

05:12:07.208 --> 05:12:09.577
FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO

05:12:09.644 --> 05:12:11.245
PAY A TRUCK, THEY HAVE AN

05:12:11.312 --> 05:12:12.980
OPTION INCLUDED IN THIS BILL

05:12:13.047 --> 05:12:14.182
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO OPT

05:12:14.248 --> 05:12:16.284
OUT AND BASICALLY AND PAY THAT

05:12:16.350 --> 05:12:18.453
FEE OF $340 PER YEAR. I SHOULD

05:12:18.519 --> 05:12:21.289
EMPHASIZE THAT IF THE VEHICLE

05:12:21.355 --> 05:12:23.057
IS SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM OR IF

05:12:23.124 --> 05:12:25.560
THEY ARE CHOOSING TO OPT OUT,

05:12:25.626 --> 05:12:26.327
THEY'RE STILL NOT SUBJECT TO

05:12:26.394 --> 05:12:27.995
THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTRATION

05:12:28.062 --> 05:12:29.430
FEES. THAT'S ONCE THEY'RE PART

05:12:29.497 --> 05:12:31.165
OF THE PROGRAM. THOSE

05:12:31.232 --> 05:12:32.266
SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTRATION FEES

05:12:32.333 --> 05:12:34.168
NO LONGER APPLY TO THEIR

05:12:34.235 --> 05:12:35.269
VEHICLE. THEY'D EITHER BE

05:12:35.336 --> 05:12:37.138
PAYING FOR THAT OPT OUT FEE.

05:12:37.205 --> 05:12:39.207
AND AGAIN, VEHICLES THAT USE

05:12:39.273 --> 05:12:40.475
FUEL. SO THOSE THOSE HYBRID

05:12:40.541 --> 05:12:42.110
VEHICLES WOULD CONTINUE TO

05:12:42.176 --> 05:12:43.878
RECEIVE A NONREFUNDABLE FUEL

05:12:43.945 --> 05:12:46.747
TAX CREDIT FOR ANY FUEL TAX

05:12:46.814 --> 05:12:49.117
PAID. SO I'M I I'VE BEEN

05:12:49.183 --> 05:12:51.252
WORKING ON THIS FOR A WHILE IN

05:12:51.319 --> 05:12:52.954
TERMS OF THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT.

05:12:53.020 --> 05:12:54.122
AND SO I'M EXCITED GETTING TO

05:12:54.188 --> 05:12:56.157
FRIDAY FOR OUR SPECIAL SESSION.

05:12:56.224 --> 05:12:57.425
HOPEFULLY EARLY NEXT WEEK WE

05:12:57.492 --> 05:13:00.394
MIGHT HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL

05:13:00.461 --> 05:13:03.931
INFORMATION AND HAPPY TO ANSWER

05:13:03.998 --> 05:13:05.766
ANY QUESTIONS WHEN WE FINISH

05:13:05.833 --> 05:13:09.437
THIS PANEL. THANK YOU. CAN YOU

05:13:09.504 --> 05:13:12.006
JUST GO OVER THAT LAST BULLET

05:13:12.073 --> 05:13:14.809
POINT AGAIN? YOU NOTED THAT

05:13:14.876 --> 05:13:16.344
VEHICLES PAYING ROCK WILL NOT

05:13:16.410 --> 05:13:18.346
HAVE TO PAY THE SUPPLEMENTAL.

05:13:18.412 --> 05:13:20.581
CAN YOU JUST REVIEW THAT LAST

05:13:20.648 --> 05:13:24.218
PART? YEAH. SO OREGON USES A

05:13:24.285 --> 05:13:25.052
TIERED REGISTRATION STRUCTURE

05:13:25.119 --> 05:13:27.388
WHERE VEHICLES PAY A

05:13:27.455 --> 05:13:28.456
SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTRY

05:13:28.523 --> 05:13:31.058
REGISTRATION FEE BASED ON THEIR

05:13:31.125 --> 05:13:33.361
EFFICIENCY. AND SO WHILE, YOU

05:13:33.427 --> 05:13:37.298
KNOW, IN THIS MOMENT, AN EV IS

05:13:37.365 --> 05:13:38.933
SUBJECT TO A SUPPLEMENTAL

05:13:39.000 --> 05:13:41.102
REGISTRATION FEE OF $115 PER

05:13:41.169 --> 05:13:42.870
YEAR. AND SO BASICALLY, ONCE

05:13:42.937 --> 05:13:45.573
THEY ARE PART OF THE MANDATORY

05:13:45.640 --> 05:13:47.942
REC PROGRAM, THAT FEE NO LONGER

05:13:48.009 --> 05:13:49.610
APPLIES TO THEM. THEY'RE JUST

05:13:49.677 --> 05:13:50.378
PAYING THE REGISTRATION FEE

05:13:50.444 --> 05:13:51.946
THAT EVERY VEHICLE PAYS. AND

05:13:52.013 --> 05:13:53.314
THEN THEY'RE EITHER PAYING THE

05:13:53.381 --> 05:13:55.917
ROCK BY THE MILE OR THE OPT OUT

05:13:55.983 --> 05:13:59.053
FEE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. OKAY.

05:13:59.120 --> 05:14:02.256
AND THEN YOU ALSO NOTED THAT

05:14:02.323 --> 05:14:04.158
THE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE A

05:14:04.225 --> 05:14:06.594
CREDIT FOR THE FUEL TAX PAID.

05:14:06.661 --> 05:14:08.796
HOW DID THEY RECORD THE FUEL

05:14:08.863 --> 05:14:11.165
TAX PAID? YEAH. SO IT DEPENDS

05:14:11.232 --> 05:14:13.534
ON THE MILEAGE REPORTING OPTION

05:14:13.601 --> 05:14:14.936
THAT THEY USE. AND SO FOR THOSE

05:14:15.002 --> 05:14:17.171
WHO USE THE THE OBD2 DEVICE,

05:14:17.238 --> 05:14:20.041
THAT DEVICE CAN DETERMINE HOW

05:14:20.107 --> 05:14:22.476
MUCH FUEL IS BEING USED. IT

05:14:22.543 --> 05:14:24.579
KNOWS THE EFFICIENCY. AND SO

05:14:24.645 --> 05:14:25.046
WHEN IT REPORTS THAT

05:14:25.112 --> 05:14:26.647
INFORMATION TO THE ACCOUNT

05:14:26.714 --> 05:14:28.482
MANAGER, THEY KNOW EXACTLY HOW

05:14:28.549 --> 05:14:30.685
MUCH FUEL THEY'VE USED. AND SO

05:14:30.751 --> 05:14:31.986
THEY CAN CALCULATE THE CREDIT

05:14:32.053 --> 05:14:33.187
AGAINST WHAT THEY OWE IN RUCK

05:14:33.254 --> 05:14:36.224
CHARGES. FOR THOSE UTILIZING

05:14:36.290 --> 05:14:38.326
TELEMATICS, THERE'S A SIMILAR

05:14:38.392 --> 05:14:40.194
SITUATION WHERE THE VEHICLE

05:14:40.261 --> 05:14:41.062
EFFECTIVELY KNOWS HOW MUCH FUEL

05:14:41.128 --> 05:14:43.564
HAS BEEN CONSUMED, PASSES THAT

05:14:43.631 --> 05:14:45.199
ALONG TO THE ACCOUNT MANAGER.

05:14:45.266 --> 05:14:48.069
LASTLY, FOR THE ODOMETER

05:14:48.135 --> 05:14:50.371
CAPTURE AT THAT POINT, SINCE

05:14:50.438 --> 05:14:52.707
THERE'S NO KIND OF

05:14:52.773 --> 05:14:54.942
TECHNOLOGICAL INTEGRATION IN

05:14:55.009 --> 05:14:57.078
TERMS OF THE FUEL USED, THE

05:14:57.144 --> 05:14:59.513
ACCOUNT MANAGER RELIES ON THE

05:14:59.580 --> 05:15:01.482
COMBINED EPA RATING FOR THE

05:15:01.549 --> 05:15:02.883
VEHICLE TO DETERMINE, YOU KNOW,

05:15:02.950 --> 05:15:04.185
FROM HOW MANY MILES THEY'VE

05:15:04.252 --> 05:15:06.220
DRIVEN BASED ON THE LAST TIME

05:15:06.287 --> 05:15:07.088
THEY SUBMITTED AN ODOMETER READ

05:15:07.154 --> 05:15:08.923
AND THE EFFICIENCY THAT VEHICLE

05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:11.192
HAS, IT'S RATED BY THE EPA TO

05:15:11.259 --> 05:15:12.360
CALCULATE THE FUEL TAX CREDIT.

05:15:12.426 --> 05:15:14.195
AND SO IT IS AN ESTIMATE

05:15:14.262 --> 05:15:16.130
BASICALLY. SO IT'S NOT

05:15:16.197 --> 05:15:17.865
CALCULATING IT BASED ON I

05:15:17.932 --> 05:15:20.067
ACTUALLY PAID THIS AMOUNT

05:15:20.134 --> 05:15:20.935
BECAUSE I WENT TO THIS

05:15:21.002 --> 05:15:23.004
PARTICULAR GAS STATION VERSUS A

05:15:23.070 --> 05:15:25.206
GAS STATION A LITTLE WAYS AWAY

05:15:25.273 --> 05:15:26.941
THAT WAS HAD THAT HAD A LOWER

05:15:27.008 --> 05:15:28.909
PRICE. SO IT'S TAKING WHAT THE

05:15:28.976 --> 05:15:30.945
AVERAGE EXPECTED. WELL,

05:15:31.012 --> 05:15:33.014
REGARDLESS OF WHICH GAS STATION,

05:15:33.080 --> 05:15:34.115
THE FUEL TAX ITSELF PER GALLON

05:15:34.181 --> 05:15:37.018
REMAINS THE SAME. AND SO THE

05:15:37.084 --> 05:15:40.321
IT'S IT'S THEY'D BE REFUNDED AT

05:15:40.388 --> 05:15:44.258
$0.40 PER GALLON. THANK YOU. I

05:15:44.325 --> 05:15:46.927
THINK I HAD ONE MORE QUESTION

05:15:46.994 --> 05:15:57.538
FOR YOU. YOU NOTED ON YOUR FOR

05:15:57.605 --> 05:15:59.173
THE GOVERNOR'S HE CALLED THE

05:15:59.240 --> 05:16:01.542
SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND

05:16:01.609 --> 05:16:02.943
YOU NOTED THAT YOU ALL HAVE

05:16:03.010 --> 05:16:04.578
REVENUE SOURCES FROM PAYROLL

05:16:04.645 --> 05:16:06.914
TAX FOR TRANSIT PROVIDERS. IS

05:16:06.981 --> 05:16:09.750
THAT RELATED AT ALL TO YOUR

05:16:09.817 --> 05:16:10.384
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING OVERALL,

05:16:10.451 --> 05:16:12.987
OR COULD YOU SAY WHAT THAT IS.

05:16:13.054 --> 05:16:15.289
YEAH. SO THAT PAYROLL TAX, IT'S

05:16:15.356 --> 05:16:17.158
IT'S ONE TENTH OF 1% CURRENTLY

05:16:17.224 --> 05:16:18.759
THEY'RE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

05:16:18.826 --> 05:16:20.761
DOUBLING IT TO 2/10 OF A

05:16:20.828 --> 05:16:24.165
PERCENT. AND SO THAT MONEY

05:16:24.231 --> 05:16:26.000
COMES OUT OF PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS.

05:16:26.067 --> 05:16:27.301
AND THAT MONEY GETS DEPOSITED

05:16:27.368 --> 05:16:29.970
INTO OUR STIFF FUND, WHICH THEN

05:16:30.037 --> 05:16:34.508
HELPS FUND TRANSIT ACROSS THE

05:16:34.575 --> 05:16:37.945
STATE. SO EVERYBODY IN THE

05:16:38.012 --> 05:16:41.115
STATE WHO WORKS PAYS FOR THAT.

05:16:41.182 --> 05:16:44.018
AND THAT GOES FOR TRANSIT.

05:16:44.085 --> 05:16:45.319
CORRECT? OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK

05:16:45.386 --> 05:16:50.791
YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:16:50.858 --> 05:16:53.127
WITH THAT, MOVING ON TO OUR

05:16:53.194 --> 05:16:56.263
NEXT OUR NEXT AND FINAL

05:16:56.330 --> 05:17:00.301
PANELIST, SCOTT CUMMINGS. GOOD

05:17:00.368 --> 05:17:05.039
EVENING. HELLO. WE CAN HEAR YOU.

05:17:05.106 --> 05:17:08.576
ALL RIGHT. SO I'M GOING TO TALK

05:17:08.642 --> 05:17:09.543
ABOUT VIRGINIA'S MILEAGE CHOICE

05:17:09.610 --> 05:17:12.113
PROGRAM. RIGHT. AND THANK YOU

05:17:12.179 --> 05:17:13.514
FOR BEING OUR FINAL PANELIST

05:17:13.581 --> 05:17:16.417
ALL THE WAY FROM VIRGINIA. MY

05:17:16.484 --> 05:17:21.389
PLEASURE. ALL RIGHT. NEXT SLIDE.

05:17:21.455 --> 05:17:24.658
SO VIRGINIA STARTED TAXING FUEL

05:17:24.725 --> 05:17:27.294
IN 1923. NOT QUITE THE 1919

05:17:27.361 --> 05:17:29.196
THAT TRISH POINTED OUT, BUT FOR

05:17:29.263 --> 05:17:30.965
A HUNDRED YEARS WE'VE BEEN

05:17:31.031 --> 05:17:33.067
RELYING ON THAT AS A MAJOR

05:17:33.134 --> 05:17:34.402
FUNDING SOURCE FOR OUR

05:17:34.468 --> 05:17:35.936
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. AND

05:17:36.003 --> 05:17:37.905
ENSUING YEARS. WE HAVE

05:17:37.972 --> 05:17:39.306
DIVERSIFIED THE POOL OF

05:17:39.373 --> 05:17:41.075
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING SOURCES.

05:17:41.142 --> 05:17:43.144
A LOT OF THOSE THAT DOUG

05:17:43.210 --> 05:17:45.279
HIGHLIGHTED, BUT WE STILL RELY

05:17:45.346 --> 05:17:48.149
ON FUEL TAXES FOR ABOUT A

05:17:48.215 --> 05:17:49.517
QUARTER OF OUR TRANSPORTATION

05:17:49.583 --> 05:17:52.086
BUDGET. AND IN 2018, WE SAW HOW

05:17:52.153 --> 05:17:53.854
SHAKY THAT RELIANCE IS. THAT

05:17:53.921 --> 05:17:55.156
WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT VEHICLE

05:17:55.222 --> 05:17:56.524
MILES TRAVELED IN THE STATE

05:17:56.590 --> 05:17:58.893
INCREASED, BUT REVENUE FROM

05:17:58.959 --> 05:18:00.428
MOTOR FUELS TAXES DECREASED

05:18:00.494 --> 05:18:02.163
WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

05:18:02.229 --> 05:18:03.364
THEY'VE BOTH FALLEN IN TIMES OF

05:18:03.431 --> 05:18:05.099
RECESSION, BUT TYPICALLY WHEN

05:18:05.166 --> 05:18:07.268
PEOPLE TRAVEL MORE, THEY PAID

05:18:07.334 --> 05:18:08.969
MORE IN GAS TAX. AND THE FACT

05:18:09.036 --> 05:18:10.471
THAT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN MEANT

05:18:10.538 --> 05:18:12.807
THAT THE IMPACT FROM THE

05:18:12.873 --> 05:18:14.175
LOOMING FUEL EFFICIENCY ISSUE

05:18:14.241 --> 05:18:15.309
THAT WAS OUT THERE ON THE

05:18:15.376 --> 05:18:16.944
HORIZON AND FINALLY COME TO

05:18:17.011 --> 05:18:18.245
VIRGINIA. SO IN RESPONSE, THE

05:18:18.312 --> 05:18:20.181
STATE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED OUR

05:18:20.247 --> 05:18:21.882
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION TO

05:18:21.949 --> 05:18:23.184
CONVENE A WORKING GROUP TO

05:18:23.250 --> 05:18:25.686
STUDY THE IMPACT OF FUEL

05:18:25.753 --> 05:18:27.655
EFFICIENCY ON THE

05:18:27.721 --> 05:18:28.155
SUSTAINABILITY OF

05:18:28.222 --> 05:18:30.624
TRANSPORTATION REVENUE. NEXT

05:18:30.691 --> 05:18:34.195
SLIDE. SO THE WORKING GROUP

05:18:34.261 --> 05:18:37.064
CONFIRMED THAT THAT TREND OF

05:18:37.131 --> 05:18:39.233
DISPARATE TREND LINES BETWEEN

05:18:39.300 --> 05:18:42.169
VMT AND GAS TAX REVENUES WAS

05:18:42.236 --> 05:18:44.572
HERE TO STAY, AND IT WAS GOING

05:18:44.638 --> 05:18:46.040
TO ACCELERATE IN THE FUTURE.

05:18:46.106 --> 05:18:48.542
BUT THEY REALLY HONED IN ON THE

05:18:48.609 --> 05:18:50.478
CAUSE OF THAT, LESS WHAT THE

05:18:50.544 --> 05:18:52.146
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WOULD SAY

05:18:52.213 --> 05:18:54.448
WAS, WAS FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES,

05:18:54.515 --> 05:18:56.050
AND THEY REALLY CONCENTRATED ON

05:18:56.116 --> 05:18:57.051
THE IMPACT FROM RISING FUEL

05:18:57.117 --> 05:18:59.186
ECONOMY OF TRADITIONAL INTERNAL

05:18:59.253 --> 05:19:00.654
COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES.

05:19:00.721 --> 05:19:03.224
THEY SAID THAT WAS WHERE IN THE

05:19:03.290 --> 05:19:05.292
SHORT TERM, BY 2030, VIRGINIA'S

05:19:05.359 --> 05:19:07.561
IMPACT WAS REALLY GOING TO BE

05:19:07.628 --> 05:19:10.631
COMING FROM. NEXT SLIDE. SO IN

05:19:10.698 --> 05:19:13.467
RESPONSE, THEY RECOMMENDED

05:19:13.534 --> 05:19:16.337
SEVERAL DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS

05:19:16.403 --> 05:19:19.206
FROM SHORT TERM TO LONG TERM.

05:19:19.273 --> 05:19:20.140
IN THE NEAR TERM, THEY SAID WE

05:19:20.207 --> 05:19:22.409
SHOULD INCREASE THE GAS TAX.

05:19:22.476 --> 05:19:24.211
AND INDEX IT TO INFLATION SO

05:19:24.278 --> 05:19:26.380
THAT OUR PURCHASING POWER WOULD

05:19:26.447 --> 05:19:27.281
WOULD STOP BEING ERODED. THEY

05:19:27.348 --> 05:19:29.350
ALSO RECOMMENDED A HIGHWAY USE

05:19:29.416 --> 05:19:31.352
FEE AIMED AT THOSE FUEL

05:19:31.418 --> 05:19:32.219
EFFICIENT VEHICLES, AND CAPTURE

05:19:32.286 --> 05:19:33.954
THE REVENUE THAT WAS NOT BEING

05:19:34.021 --> 05:19:37.224
COLLECTED FROM GAS TAX. GAS

05:19:37.291 --> 05:19:40.194
PURCHASES AT THE PUMP. LONG

05:19:40.261 --> 05:19:41.795
TERM, THEY SAID, WE NEED TO GET

05:19:41.862 --> 05:19:43.163
AWAY FROM GAS TAX ALTOGETHER

05:19:43.230 --> 05:19:45.666
AND MOVE TO A MILEAGE BASED

05:19:45.733 --> 05:19:46.934
USER FEE AND RECOGNIZING HOW

05:19:47.001 --> 05:19:49.069
LONG TERM THAT SOLUTION WOULD

05:19:49.136 --> 05:19:51.238
BE, THEY SAID. IN THE MID TERM,

05:19:51.305 --> 05:19:54.074
WE SHOULD IMPOSE A MILEAGE

05:19:54.141 --> 05:19:57.011
BASED USER FEE PROGRAM BY

05:19:57.077 --> 05:19:59.713
COLLECTING THAT HIGHWAY USE FEE

05:19:59.780 --> 05:20:05.219
ON A PER MILE BASIS. NEXT SLIDE.

05:20:05.286 --> 05:20:07.087
SO THAT REPORT CAME OUT IN

05:20:07.154 --> 05:20:08.322
DECEMBER AND THE FOLLOWING

05:20:08.389 --> 05:20:10.357
MONTH, IN JANUARY OF 2020, THE

05:20:10.424 --> 05:20:12.059
VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE CONVENED,

05:20:12.126 --> 05:20:13.894
AND THEY ADOPTED MANY OF THE

05:20:13.961 --> 05:20:15.362
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE

05:20:15.429 --> 05:20:16.530
WORKING GROUP MADE. THEY

05:20:16.597 --> 05:20:17.998
INDEXED, OR THEY RAISED THE GAS

05:20:18.065 --> 05:20:21.468
TAX BY $0.05 A YEAR FOR TWO

05:20:21.535 --> 05:20:22.269
YEARS AND THEN INDEXED IT TO

05:20:22.336 --> 05:20:25.072
INFLATION THEREAFTER. THEY ALSO

05:20:25.139 --> 05:20:26.240
ESTABLISHED THE HIGHWAY USE FEE

05:20:26.307 --> 05:20:28.108
ON ALL FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES,

05:20:28.175 --> 05:20:31.845
WHICH THE LEGISLATION SET AT 25

05:20:31.912 --> 05:20:34.014
MILES PER GALLON OR GREATER.

05:20:34.081 --> 05:20:36.016
AND I'LL GO INTO THE HIGHWAY

05:20:36.083 --> 05:20:37.017
USE FEES CALCULATIONS IN A

05:20:37.084 --> 05:20:39.153
LATER SLIDE. THE HIGHWAY FEE IS

05:20:39.219 --> 05:20:42.590
DUE AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION,

05:20:42.656 --> 05:20:48.095
AND THE LEGISLATION ALSO

05:20:48.162 --> 05:20:49.396
DIRECTED THE VIRGINIA

05:20:49.463 --> 05:20:51.365
DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO

05:20:51.432 --> 05:20:55.569
SET UP A MILEAGE CHOICE PROGRAM,

05:20:55.636 --> 05:20:58.172
ALLOW CONSUMERS TO PAY THAT

05:20:58.238 --> 05:21:01.175
HIGHWAY USE FEE ON A PER MILE

05:21:01.241 --> 05:21:02.943
BASIS. THEY GIVE US TWO MORE

05:21:03.010 --> 05:21:04.211
YEARS TO IMPLEMENT IT. THE

05:21:04.278 --> 05:21:06.480
HIGHWAY USE FEE BECAME

05:21:06.547 --> 05:21:08.048
EFFECTIVE JULY 1ST, 2020, AND

05:21:08.115 --> 05:21:10.884
WE NEEDED TO HAVE THE MILEAGE

05:21:10.951 --> 05:21:11.752
CHOICE PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING

05:21:11.819 --> 05:21:16.890
BY JULY 1ST OF 22. NEXT SLIDE.

05:21:16.957 --> 05:21:19.226
THIS SHOWS THE IMPACT. THIS TOP

05:21:19.293 --> 05:21:21.996
CHART IS THE IMPACT OF THAT GAS

05:21:22.062 --> 05:21:23.464
TAX INCREASE GOING ALL THE WAY

05:21:23.530 --> 05:21:25.866
BACK TO 1923. YOU CAN SEE IT'S

05:21:25.933 --> 05:21:27.601
BEEN RAISED OVER THE YEARS WITH

05:21:27.668 --> 05:21:30.904
LONG PERIODS OF OF STATIC, NO

05:21:30.971 --> 05:21:34.141
CHANGES. AND THEN THE IMPACT OF

05:21:34.208 --> 05:21:36.143
THE LEGISLATION IN 2020,

05:21:36.210 --> 05:21:38.278
THERE'S TWO FIVE CENT INCREASES.

05:21:38.345 --> 05:21:42.116
AND THEN THE IMPACT OF THE CPI

05:21:42.182 --> 05:21:45.452
INFLATION FACTOR. THE TABLE

05:21:45.519 --> 05:21:47.655
LOWER. THAT SHOWS THE FINANCIAL

05:21:47.721 --> 05:21:51.058
IMPACT FROM THOSE CHANGES. THE

05:21:51.125 --> 05:21:54.028
INCREASE HAS HAS STOPPED THE

05:21:54.094 --> 05:21:57.197
DOWNWARD TREND OF REVENUE IN

05:21:57.264 --> 05:22:00.067
COLLECTIONS FROM FUEL TAXES.

05:22:00.134 --> 05:22:01.935
AND THEN NEXT SLIDE, YOU CAN

05:22:02.002 --> 05:22:05.105
ALSO SEE THE IMPACT FROM THE

05:22:05.172 --> 05:22:07.574
HIGHWAY USE FEE $105 MILLION

05:22:07.641 --> 05:22:09.510
THIS FISCAL YEAR IS THE

05:22:09.576 --> 05:22:11.045
ESTIMATE. SO THE THE HIGHWAY

05:22:11.111 --> 05:22:14.181
USE FEE IS IMPOSED ON ON ALL

05:22:14.248 --> 05:22:15.983
FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES. WE USE

05:22:16.050 --> 05:22:18.118
A VIN DECODER TO GET THE

05:22:18.185 --> 05:22:19.319
MANUFACTURERS FUEL ECONOMY FOR

05:22:19.386 --> 05:22:22.056
A PARTICULAR VEHICLE. AND THEN

05:22:22.122 --> 05:22:24.191
ALL THE ONES THAT ARE

05:22:24.258 --> 05:22:25.526
DETERMINED TO BE 25 MILES PER

05:22:25.592 --> 05:22:28.562
GALLON OR ABOVE ARE ASSESSED. A

05:22:28.629 --> 05:22:29.930
FORMULA BASICALLY TAKES THE

05:22:29.997 --> 05:22:32.332
FUEL TAXES PAID BY THE AVERAGE

05:22:32.399 --> 05:22:35.002
VEHICLE, WHICH THE LEGISLATION

05:22:35.069 --> 05:22:37.271
SET AT 23 MILES PER 23.7 MILES

05:22:37.337 --> 05:22:40.407
PER GALLON, AND ALSO DETERMINED

05:22:40.474 --> 05:22:41.742
THAT THE AVERAGE MILES DRIVEN

05:22:41.809 --> 05:22:43.043
BY A VEHICLE IN THE

05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:46.180
COMMONWEALTH IS 11,600. SO THEN

05:22:46.246 --> 05:22:47.448
IT'S JUST MATH THAT AVERAGE

05:22:47.514 --> 05:22:50.484
VEHICLE BUYS 489 GALLONS OF

05:22:50.551 --> 05:22:51.985
GASOLINE THAT'S ASSESSED AT

05:22:52.052 --> 05:22:54.121
THAT PARTICULAR FISCAL YEARS

05:22:54.188 --> 05:22:56.056
PER GALLON GAS TAX RATE, WHICH

05:22:56.123 --> 05:22:58.258
THIS YEAR IS 31.7 CENTS PER

05:22:58.325 --> 05:23:01.261
GALLON. THAT MEANS THAT THE

05:23:01.328 --> 05:23:03.430
AVERAGE VEHICLE PAYS $155 AT

05:23:03.497 --> 05:23:04.298
THE PUMP. ALL THE FUEL

05:23:04.364 --> 05:23:07.601
EFFICIENT VEHICLES ARE MEASURED

05:23:07.668 --> 05:23:08.969
AGAINST THAT BENCHMARK AND

05:23:09.036 --> 05:23:11.205
ASSESSED 85% OF THE DIFFERENCE.

05:23:11.271 --> 05:23:13.006
SO AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE WHICH

05:23:13.073 --> 05:23:15.109
PAYS NO GAS TAX PAYS 85% OF

05:23:15.175 --> 05:23:18.112
THAT $155. SO THEIR HIGHWAY USE

05:23:18.178 --> 05:23:22.449
FEE IS $131.88. FOR THIS FISCAL

05:23:22.516 --> 05:23:26.153
YEAR, THE GRAPHIC ON THE RIGHT

05:23:26.220 --> 05:23:28.622
KIND OF SHOWS THE THE

05:23:28.689 --> 05:23:30.524
VARIATIONS OF THE AVERAGE

05:23:30.591 --> 05:23:31.325
VEHICLE AND THE ELECTRIC

05:23:31.391 --> 05:23:33.093
VEHICLE AND THEIR GAS TAX

05:23:33.160 --> 05:23:35.229
PAYMENTS VERSUS THEIR IOUS, VÆ

05:23:35.295 --> 05:23:36.930
HYBRIDS AND FUEL EFFICIENT

05:23:36.997 --> 05:23:39.533
VEHICLES PAY A MIX OF GAS TAXES

05:23:39.600 --> 05:23:43.403
AT THE PUMP, AS WELL AS THE

05:23:43.470 --> 05:23:44.438
HIGHWAY USE FEE. SO THE HIGHWAY

05:23:44.505 --> 05:23:46.406
USE FEE VARIES BY THE

05:23:46.473 --> 05:23:48.342
PARTICULAR VEHICLE DEPENDING ON

05:23:48.408 --> 05:23:51.311
ITS FUEL EFFICIENCY. BUT EVERY

05:23:51.378 --> 05:23:52.279
SINGLE VEHICLE IS ASSUMED BASED

05:23:52.346 --> 05:23:55.115
ON HOW USE FEE TO DRIVE 11,600

05:23:55.182 --> 05:23:57.117
MILES. THE HIGHWAY USE FEE

05:23:57.184 --> 05:23:59.253
DOESN'T ALLOW FOR ANY

05:23:59.319 --> 05:24:00.087
DISCRETION ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT

05:24:00.154 --> 05:24:02.222
VEHICLE IS ACTUALLY DRIVEN.

05:24:02.289 --> 05:24:05.559
NEXT SLIDE. THE DISCRETION

05:24:05.626 --> 05:24:08.195
COMES FROM THE MILEAGE BASED

05:24:08.262 --> 05:24:11.098
USER FEE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE.

05:24:11.165 --> 05:24:13.000
CUSTOMERS CAN ENROLL IN THAT

05:24:13.066 --> 05:24:14.134

VEHICLE, AS WELL AS THEIR PER

05:24:29.550 --> 05:24:31.585
MILE RATE. ONCE THE CUSTOMER

05:24:31.652 --> 05:24:33.120

SYSTEM THAT LETS US KNOW NOT TO

05:24:40.194 --> 05:24:42.429
CHARGE THE HIGHWAY USE FEE.

05:24:42.496 --> 05:24:43.864
WHEN THE CUSTOMER SUBSEQUENTLY

05:24:43.931 --> 05:24:47.901
RENEWS THEIR REGISTRATION. WE

05:24:47.968 --> 05:24:50.504
HAVE ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE

05:25:01.315 --> 05:25:05.819
THE CFA GRANT TO OFFSET PROGRAM

05:25:05.886 --> 05:25:13.694

THEIR TELEMATICS. THEY CAN ALSO

05:25:35.249 --> 05:25:37.284
CHOOSE TO HAVE GPS ENABLED IF

05:25:37.351 --> 05:25:38.886
THEY LIKE. THERE'S NO

05:25:38.952 --> 05:25:41.054
PROGRAMMATIC BENEFIT TO HAVING

05:25:41.121 --> 05:25:44.057
THE GPS ENABLED. VIRGINIA'S LAW

05:25:44.124 --> 05:25:46.727
DOES NOT EXEMPT OUT-OF-STATE

05:25:46.793 --> 05:25:48.028
MILES OR MILES TRAVELED ON ON

05:25:48.095 --> 05:25:51.231
PRIVATE ROADS. ALL MILES

GPS FEATURES DO. THERE ARE SOME

05:25:59.139 --> 05:26:00.173
BENEFITS IN THE SMARTPHONE APP

05:26:00.240 --> 05:26:01.942
THE CUSTOMERS NEED TO DOWNLOAD

05:26:11.618 --> 05:26:13.220
THE SMARTPHONE APP IS A

05:26:13.287 --> 05:26:14.988
REQUIREMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN

05:26:15.055 --> 05:26:18.158
THE PROGRAM. CUSTOMERS USE THAT

05:26:18.225 --> 05:26:21.028
TO RECORD AN ODOMETER CAPTURE

05:26:21.094 --> 05:26:24.064
PROCESS WHEN THEY FIRST ENROLL

05:26:24.131 --> 05:26:25.265
IN THE PROGRAM AS A STARTING

05:26:25.332 --> 05:26:27.434
POINT, AS WELL AS SOME CHECKING

05:26:27.501 --> 05:26:30.837
POINTS PERIODICALLY TO TO TRUE

05:26:30.904 --> 05:26:32.239
UP THE MILES CAPTURED BY THE

INVOICES THAT A VA SENDS THEM

05:26:42.215 --> 05:26:44.518
ARE DEBITED AGAINST THAT

05:26:44.584 --> 05:26:45.919
PREPAID ACCOUNT, MUCH LIKE A

05:26:45.986 --> 05:26:48.188
TOLL PROGRAM WOULD. SO THAT

05:26:48.255 --> 05:26:50.223
PREPAID WALLET ENSURES THAT

05:26:50.290 --> 05:26:51.959
CUSTOMERS HAVE THE FUNDING

05:26:52.025 --> 05:26:53.226
ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT THIS

05:26:53.293 --> 05:26:56.630

SENDS THE SENDS THE FUNDS TO

05:27:02.469 --> 05:27:05.238
VIRGINIA. IT'S A FULLY TURNKEY

05:27:05.305 --> 05:27:08.175
SYSTEM. VIRGINIA DOESN'T HAVE

05:27:08.241 --> 05:27:11.111
ANY REAL INTERACTION WITH THE

05:27:11.178 --> 05:27:13.246
CUSTOMERS. THEY ARE

05:27:13.313 --> 05:27:17.250
PARTICIPATING THROUGH THE MOST.

05:27:17.317 --> 05:27:21.388
NEXT SLIDE. AND THIS JUST SHOWS

05:27:21.455 --> 05:27:24.024
YOU SORT OF THE RANGE OF

05:27:24.091 --> 05:27:26.927
PARTICIPATING VEHICLES FROM 25

05:27:26.994 --> 05:27:29.262
MILES PER GALLON AT THE GAS

05:27:29.329 --> 05:27:31.331
POINT ALL THE WAY THROUGH, AND

05:27:31.398 --> 05:27:33.066
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. IT WAS

05:27:33.133 --> 05:27:35.002
INTERESTING. ONCE WE SET UP THE

05:27:35.068 --> 05:27:37.037
PROGRAM, WE THOUGHT WE'D SEE

05:27:37.104 --> 05:27:39.139
MORE PARTICIPATION FROM THAT

05:27:39.206 --> 05:27:40.040
HIGHER FUEL ECONOMY VEHICLES,

05:27:40.107 --> 05:27:42.476
JUST BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE

05:27:42.542 --> 05:27:43.243
MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO SAVE

05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:46.113
MONEY WITH THE HIGHER FEES. BUT

05:27:46.179 --> 05:27:49.016
WE FOUND A LOT OF PARTICIPATION

05:27:49.082 --> 05:27:52.219
FROM DRIVERS OF ALL TYPES OF

05:27:52.285 --> 05:27:53.920
VEHICLES. RIGHT NOW, ABOUT HALF

05:27:53.987 --> 05:27:55.489
OF OUR PARTICIPATION IS FROM

05:27:55.555 --> 05:27:57.924
GASOLINE VEHICLES, 30% IS FROM

05:27:57.991 --> 05:28:01.528
HYBRIDS, AND 20% IS FROM EVS.

05:28:01.595 --> 05:28:02.963
ROUGHLY 2 MILLION OUT OF THE 7

05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:05.032
MILLION REGISTERED VEHICLES IN

05:28:05.098 --> 05:28:06.366
VIRGINIA ARE ASSESSED TO

05:28:06.433 --> 05:28:09.403
HIGHWAY USE FEE, ABOUT 1% ARE

05:28:09.469 --> 05:28:10.470
20,000. 23,000 ARE

05:28:10.537 --> 05:28:13.540
PARTICIPATING AS OF EARLIER

05:28:13.607 --> 05:28:16.243
THIS SUMMER, AND MOST MILEAGE

05:28:16.309 --> 05:28:18.245
CHOICE USERS ARE SAVING MONEY.

05:28:18.311 --> 05:28:19.880
THEY'RE STAYING BELOW THE CAP.

05:28:19.946 --> 05:28:21.448
THE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN

05:28:21.515 --> 05:28:23.083
MILEAGE CHOICE CAN'T COST THEM

05:28:23.150 --> 05:28:25.085
ANY MORE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE

05:28:25.152 --> 05:28:26.920
JUST PAID BY. BY STAYING WITH

05:28:26.987 --> 05:28:29.189
THE HIGHWAY USE FEE, AND MOST

05:28:29.256 --> 05:28:31.191
ARE FINDING THAT THEY SAVE

05:28:31.258 --> 05:28:33.427
MONEY AND THEY ARE ENJOYING THE

05:28:33.493 --> 05:28:35.395
PROGRAM. 80% RENEW FOR A SECOND

05:28:35.462 --> 05:28:38.698
YEAR, AND 71% ARE STILL

05:28:38.765 --> 05:28:41.001
PARTICIPATING. COMING UP ON OUR

05:28:41.068 --> 05:28:43.437
FOURTH YEAR OF OF OFFERING THE

05:28:43.503 --> 05:28:46.006

RECORD ABOUT 6.5 MILLION MILES

05:28:49.976 --> 05:28:52.145
EVERY MONTH, PAYING ABOUT

05:28:52.212 --> 05:28:54.047
$90,000 IN FEES. AND WE THIS IS

05:28:54.114 --> 05:28:55.715
A PERMANENT PROGRAM FOR

05:28:55.782 --> 05:28:57.317
VIRGINIA. WE CONTINUE TO ENROLL

05:28:57.384 --> 05:28:59.152
NEW CUSTOMERS EVERY DAY AND

05:28:59.219 --> 05:29:01.154
GAIN MORE VALUABLE INSIGHT

05:29:01.221 --> 05:29:03.290
ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM CAN HELP

05:29:03.356 --> 05:29:05.192
TRANSITION THE COMMONWEALTH

05:29:05.258 --> 05:29:08.261
AWAY FROM THE GAS TAX AND TO A

05:29:08.328 --> 05:29:12.966
MILEAGE BASED USER FEE PROGRAM.

05:29:13.033 --> 05:29:16.136
THANK YOU SO MUCH. A FEW FOLLOW

05:29:16.203 --> 05:29:19.072
UP QUESTIONS. ORIGINALLY WHEN

05:29:19.139 --> 05:29:22.008
YOU THE BILL WAS PASSED IN IN

05:29:22.075 --> 05:29:24.177
2020, ARE THERE ANY BEEN ANY

05:29:24.244 --> 05:29:24.978
THOUGHT ABOUT IT GOING FROM

05:29:25.045 --> 05:29:27.114
VOLUNTARY TO MANDATORY, OR IS

05:29:27.180 --> 05:29:28.582
IT ALWAYS MEANT TO BE A

05:29:28.648 --> 05:29:32.519
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM? IT HAS BEEN

05:29:32.586 --> 05:29:33.386
A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. THE

05:29:33.453 --> 05:29:36.056
HIGHWAY USE FEE IS A MANDATORY

05:29:36.123 --> 05:29:38.625
FEE. RIGHT. BUT THIS IS IN LIEU

05:29:38.692 --> 05:29:40.060
RIGHT? THE VOLUNTARY IS THE IN

05:29:40.127 --> 05:29:42.195
LIEU OF PAYING THE HIGHWAY FEE,

05:29:42.262 --> 05:29:43.430
YOU'RE PAYING IT ON A PER MILE

05:29:43.497 --> 05:29:45.198
BASIS. YEAH. SO NOBODY CAN OPT

05:29:45.265 --> 05:29:47.701
OUT OF PAYING THE HIGHWAY USE

05:29:47.767 --> 05:29:49.136
FEE. OR THEY CAN OPT INTO

05:29:49.202 --> 05:29:51.171
PAYING IT ON A PER MILE BASIS

05:29:51.238 --> 05:29:52.072
SO THAT THEY CAN POTENTIALLY

05:29:52.139 --> 05:29:55.308
PAY LESS. CORRECT. OKAY. AND

05:29:55.375 --> 05:29:57.511
THEN YOU NOTED I WAS WONDERING

05:29:57.577 --> 05:29:59.713
AND I WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING JUST

05:29:59.779 --> 05:30:00.947
AS YOU BEGIN TO TALK. I

05:30:01.014 --> 05:30:02.649
WONDERED THIS THROUGHOUT ALL OF

05:30:02.716 --> 05:30:04.484
THE PRESENTATIONS, ISSUES OF

05:30:04.551 --> 05:30:05.886
PAYMENT. AND YOU SAID YOUR

05:30:05.952 --> 05:30:08.688
PROGRAM IS A PREPAYMENT, SO

05:30:08.755 --> 05:30:11.124
THEY PREPAID WHAT THE HIGHWAY

05:30:11.191 --> 05:30:13.894
USAGE FEE IS AND THEN IT'S

05:30:13.960 --> 05:30:16.029
BEING HIT UP AGAINST THAT OVER

05:30:16.096 --> 05:30:17.197
TIME. OR WHAT ARE THEY

05:30:17.264 --> 05:30:18.265
PREPAYING HOW MUCH ARE THEY

05:30:18.331 --> 05:30:20.567
PREPAYING I GUESS I BELIEVE

05:30:20.634 --> 05:30:24.371
IT'S IT'S A $15 AMOUNT. AND

05:30:24.437 --> 05:30:26.106
THEN WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO A

05:30:26.173 --> 05:30:27.073
CERTAIN LEVEL, IT AUTO RENEWS

05:30:27.140 --> 05:30:29.075
AND GOES BACK UP TO THAT AMOUNT.

05:30:29.142 --> 05:30:31.077
OKAY. SO LIKE YOU SAID, JUST

05:30:31.144 --> 05:30:32.078
LIKE A TOLL. SO IT'S NOT A

05:30:32.145 --> 05:30:34.114
LARGE AMOUNT. THEY COULD WORK

05:30:34.181 --> 05:30:35.615
THEIR WORK THEIR WAY UP. AND

05:30:35.682 --> 05:30:37.083
THEN WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WERE

05:30:37.150 --> 05:30:39.186
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU

05:30:39.252 --> 05:30:41.821
HAD FROM A COMMUNITY

05:30:41.888 --> 05:30:43.056
PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU ALL WERE

05:30:43.123 --> 05:30:46.226
DISCUSSING THIS LEGISLATION? I

05:30:46.293 --> 05:30:48.495
THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WAS

05:30:48.562 --> 05:30:50.997
JUST GETTING GETTING THE

05:30:51.064 --> 05:30:53.433
MILEAGE CHOICE PROGRAM BACK IN

05:30:53.500 --> 05:30:54.301
THE CONSUMER'S MIND. THAT WAS

05:30:54.367 --> 05:30:57.170
WHERE THE AD CAMPAIGN,

05:30:57.237 --> 05:30:58.305
SUPPORTED BY THE EASTERN

05:30:58.371 --> 05:30:59.406
TRANSPORTATION COALITION,

05:30:59.472 --> 05:31:01.107
REALLY CAME AND WAS VERY

05:31:01.174 --> 05:31:04.411
HELPFUL. THE HIGHWAY USE FEE

05:31:04.477 --> 05:31:07.280
WAS FIRST ASSESSED IN JULY 1ST,

05:31:07.347 --> 05:31:09.049
2020, AND THERE WERE LOTS OF

05:31:09.115 --> 05:31:11.084
NEWS STORIES AND OTHER MEDIA

05:31:11.151 --> 05:31:13.286
COVERAGE ABOUT THE NEW TAX, NEW

05:31:13.353 --> 05:31:15.088
FEE THAT WAS BEING IMPOSED AND

05:31:15.155 --> 05:31:16.890
THEN ALL THAT HAD DIED DOWN TWO

05:31:16.957 --> 05:31:18.191
YEARS LATER WHEN WE ROLLED OUT

05:31:18.258 --> 05:31:20.460
MILEAGE CHOICE, WE REALLY

05:31:20.527 --> 05:31:21.328
NEEDED TO GET THAT OPTION BACK

05:31:21.394 --> 05:31:23.096
IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS AND LET

05:31:23.163 --> 05:31:25.031
THEM KNOW THAT THEY HAD AN

05:31:25.098 --> 05:31:26.066
ALTERNATIVE TO PAYING IT ALL

05:31:26.132 --> 05:31:27.300
UPFRONT WITH THEIR REGISTRATION

05:31:27.367 --> 05:31:30.337
FEE. AND YOU ALL HAD TWO YEARS

05:31:30.403 --> 05:31:34.474
OF THE RAISED GAS TAX BY 5%.

05:31:34.541 --> 05:31:37.010
AND THEN TO HELP WITH THE

05:31:37.077 --> 05:31:39.879
TRANSITION TO THE HOUGH RIGHT,

05:31:39.946 --> 05:31:43.717
THE THERE WERE TWO FIVE CENT

05:31:43.783 --> 05:31:47.087
GAS TAX INCREASES IN FISCAL

05:31:47.153 --> 05:31:48.955
YEAR Þ EACH YEAR IN FISCAL YEAR

05:31:49.022 --> 05:31:51.424
TWO. YEAH. AND THEN IT WAS

05:31:51.491 --> 05:31:52.492
INDEXED TO INFLATION. THE

05:31:52.559 --> 05:31:55.028
INFLATION RATE IS ABOUT YOU.

05:31:55.095 --> 05:31:57.264
THE HIGHWAY USE FEE IS SINCE

05:31:57.330 --> 05:31:59.232
THAT'S TIED TO THE GAS TAX.

05:31:59.299 --> 05:32:00.400
IT'S ALSO INDEXED TO INFLATION

05:32:00.467 --> 05:32:03.270
AS WELL. SO THEY'RE PAYING BOTH.

05:32:03.336 --> 05:32:06.840
YES OKAY. SO YOU'RE OKAY. THAT

05:32:06.906 --> 05:32:07.941
MAKES SENSE. NOW WHAT I'M

05:32:08.008 --> 05:32:10.443
LOOKING AT OKAY. SO THEY ARE

05:32:10.510 --> 05:32:12.012
PAYING THEY BEFORE THEY WERE

05:32:12.078 --> 05:32:15.148
ONLY PAYING THE GAS TAX AND

05:32:15.215 --> 05:32:16.383
WHATEVER REGISTRATION FEE THEY

05:32:16.449 --> 05:32:17.150
WERE PAYING TO THE DMV OR

05:32:17.217 --> 05:32:19.486
WHATEVER. NOW THEY'RE PAYING

05:32:19.552 --> 05:32:23.590
HIGHER GAS TAX. AND THIS HIGHER

05:32:23.657 --> 05:32:27.060
USAGE HIGHWAY USAGE FEE. YES.

05:32:27.127 --> 05:32:32.098
WE HAD A LICENSE, A ADDITIONAL

05:32:32.165 --> 05:32:33.333
REGISTRATION TAX ON ELECTRIC

05:32:33.400 --> 05:32:36.002
VEHICLES. IT WAS $64 AT THE

05:32:36.069 --> 05:32:38.605
TIME, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ON

05:32:38.672 --> 05:32:40.040
ALL OTHER EFFICIENT VEHICLES.

05:32:40.106 --> 05:32:41.274
THEY WERE JUST PAYING LESS OVER

05:32:41.341 --> 05:32:42.976
TIME. SO SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW,

05:32:43.043 --> 05:32:46.112
REPLACED A TEN YEAR OLD CAR AND

05:32:46.179 --> 05:32:47.514
GAINED 30% FUEL EFFICIENCY.

05:32:47.580 --> 05:32:49.149
THEY WERE JUST PAYING LESS IN

05:32:49.215 --> 05:32:51.751
FUEL TAXES. THERE WASN'T ANY

05:32:51.818 --> 05:32:54.054
OFFSET. SO YOU'RE WE WERE

05:32:54.120 --> 05:32:55.188
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. I

05:32:55.255 --> 05:32:57.324
WASN'T SURE IF YOU WERE ON FOR

05:32:57.390 --> 05:32:58.191
IT HOW MUCH THE AVERAGE USER

05:32:58.258 --> 05:32:59.726
WOULD BE PAYING BEFORE AND

05:32:59.793 --> 05:33:03.530
AFTER. SO POST WAS YOUR AVERAGE

05:33:03.596 --> 05:33:08.468
USER PAYING MORE? POST THE

05:33:08.535 --> 05:33:11.638
ADOPTION OF THIS? THEY WOULD BE

05:33:11.705 --> 05:33:13.106
PAYING MORE FOR TRANSPORTATION

05:33:13.173 --> 05:33:14.441
NEEDS. THE INVESTMENT IN

05:33:14.507 --> 05:33:15.175
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

05:33:15.241 --> 05:33:18.745
IN YOUR STATE? YES, THE MILEAGE

05:33:18.812 --> 05:33:21.047
BASED USER FEE, THE MILEAGE

05:33:21.114 --> 05:33:22.349
CHOICE PROGRAM. IT'S NOT A IT'S

05:33:22.415 --> 05:33:25.051
NOT A ALTERNATIVE TO THE GAS

05:33:25.118 --> 05:33:27.153
TAX. IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY

05:33:27.220 --> 05:33:28.021
TO PAY THE HIGHWAY USE FEE.

05:33:28.088 --> 05:33:31.157
OKAY. THAT NEW FEE IS WAS

05:33:31.224 --> 05:33:32.959
ENVISIONED TO INCREASE

05:33:33.026 --> 05:33:34.361
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IN THE

05:33:34.427 --> 05:33:36.296
COMMONWEALTH. OKAY. THANK YOU.

05:33:36.363 --> 05:33:37.964
IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER

05:33:38.031 --> 05:33:40.834
PANELISTS HERE WHO CAN SPEAK TO

05:33:40.900 --> 05:33:42.202
THE ISSUE OF PAYMENT, I JUST

05:33:42.268 --> 05:33:44.170
WONDERED IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER

05:33:44.237 --> 05:33:45.739
STATES WHO WERE DOING ANY KIND

05:33:45.805 --> 05:33:47.140
OF PREPAY SYSTEM. I KNOW HAWAII

05:33:47.207 --> 05:33:48.441
HAS A PARTICULAR SYSTEM THAT

05:33:48.508 --> 05:33:49.876
THEY'RE DOING, BUT ANY OTHERS

05:33:49.943 --> 05:33:52.479
AS AN ISSUE OF PAYMENT FOR THE

05:33:52.545 --> 05:33:54.114
PAY AS YOU GO AND THEY MIGHT

05:33:54.180 --> 05:33:55.949
NOT STILL BE HERE, BUT IF YOU

05:33:56.015 --> 05:34:00.620
ARE, GIVE YOU A CHANCE. SO WE

05:34:00.687 --> 05:34:02.222
HAVE CURRENTLY FOR OUR AUTO

05:34:02.288 --> 05:34:04.958
PROGRAM IN IN OREGON, WE HAVE

05:34:05.024 --> 05:34:07.660
TWO ACCOUNT MANAGERS PROVIDING

05:34:07.727 --> 05:34:11.431
SERVICES AND ONE OF THEM USES

05:34:11.498 --> 05:34:14.067
SIMILAR TO WHAT SCOTT FROM

05:34:14.134 --> 05:34:16.136
VIRGINIA MENTIONED, THAT IT IS

05:34:16.202 --> 05:34:17.937
A PREPAID DIGITAL WALLET

05:34:18.004 --> 05:34:19.172
EFFECTIVELY. AND I BELIEVE THE

05:34:19.239 --> 05:34:21.241
OTHER ACCOUNT MANAGER IS POST

05:34:21.307 --> 05:34:23.176
PAY WHERE, YOU KNOW, THEY THE

05:34:23.243 --> 05:34:25.145
PARTICIPANT WOULD HAVE A CREDIT

05:34:25.211 --> 05:34:26.112
CARD ON FILE AND THEN IT'S JUST

05:34:26.179 --> 05:34:28.148
BILLED FOR THE AMOUNT THAT THEY

05:34:28.214 --> 05:34:30.150
OWE AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD.

05:34:30.216 --> 05:34:31.050
OKAY. BUT THERE IS SOME

05:34:31.117 --> 05:34:32.218
MECHANISM ON FILE. SO YOU DON'T

05:34:32.285 --> 05:34:34.220
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HAVING TO

05:34:34.287 --> 05:34:35.955
HAVE A COLLECTION SYSTEM, SO TO

05:34:36.022 --> 05:34:37.157
SPEAK, OR SPEND A LOT OF TIME

05:34:37.223 --> 05:34:39.159
DEALING WITH COLLECTIONS. OKAY.

05:34:39.225 --> 05:34:41.327
IF THERE WAS ANYBODY ELSE, I'LL

05:34:41.394 --> 05:34:43.062
GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.

05:34:43.129 --> 05:34:46.366
I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT MY LIST.

05:34:46.433 --> 05:34:49.269
ALL RIGHT. THERE BEING NONE, I

05:34:49.335 --> 05:34:51.137
WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR

05:34:51.204 --> 05:34:53.807
PANELISTS FOR THOSE THAT ARE

05:34:53.873 --> 05:34:55.008
STILL HERE AND THAT ARE NOT.

05:34:55.074 --> 05:34:56.176
THE WORK THAT YOU DO IS

05:34:56.242 --> 05:34:57.510
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR YOUR

05:34:57.577 --> 05:34:59.379
COMMUNITIES. AND I'M SO

05:34:59.446 --> 05:35:01.514
THANKFUL THAT YOU TOOK THE TIME,

05:35:01.581 --> 05:35:02.916
ESPECIALLY AFTER A LONG DAY

05:35:02.982 --> 05:35:04.284
WAITING FOR US TO BE FINISHED,

05:35:04.350 --> 05:35:06.352
TOOK THE TIME TO COME AND SPEAK

05:35:06.419 --> 05:35:07.987
TO CALIFORNIA AND HELP GUIDE

05:35:08.054 --> 05:35:10.190
OUR DECISIONS BY GIVING US A

05:35:10.256 --> 05:35:12.258
DETAILED INFORMATION. AND SO

05:35:12.325 --> 05:35:15.495
YOU ALL HAVE BEEN AMAZING AND

05:35:15.562 --> 05:35:16.129
PATIENT AND WONDERFUL, AND THIS

05:35:16.196 --> 05:35:18.131
WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR THE

05:35:18.198 --> 05:35:19.833
MEMBERS OF OUR LEGISLATURE TO

05:35:19.899 --> 05:35:21.968
HAVE THIS AS A REFERENCE POINT

05:35:22.035 --> 05:35:24.137
ON HOW TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

05:35:24.204 --> 05:35:25.939
DOING THE RIGHT THINGS FOR

05:35:26.005 --> 05:35:28.208
CALIFORNIANS, AND MAKING SURE

05:35:28.274 --> 05:35:30.510
THAT WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION

05:35:30.577 --> 05:35:32.345
SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE AS IT

05:35:32.412 --> 05:35:33.980
RELATES TO TRANSPORTATION THAT

05:35:34.047 --> 05:35:36.182
WORKS FOR THE FUTURE, THAT IS

05:35:36.249 --> 05:35:37.884
SAFE AND RELIABLE, GETS PEOPLE

05:35:37.951 --> 05:35:39.519
WHERE THEY NEED TO GO, BUT AT

05:35:39.586 --> 05:35:41.221
THE SAME TIME BEING DONE IN THE

05:35:41.287 --> 05:35:43.256
MOST EFFICIENT WAY. THAT

05:35:43.323 --> 05:35:45.058
ALLEVIATES THE BURDEN ON OUR

05:35:45.124 --> 05:35:47.660
TAXPAYERS OR JUST THE PEOPLE IN

05:35:47.727 --> 05:35:49.062
OUR COMMUNITY. WE IT HAS NOT

05:35:49.128 --> 05:35:51.631
LOST ON US THAT WE HAVE TO

05:35:51.698 --> 05:35:52.932
FOCUS AS A LEGISLATURE ON

05:35:52.999 --> 05:35:55.134
AFFORDABILITY. SO WE HAVE THIS

05:35:55.201 --> 05:35:55.835
CONVERSATION GUIDED THROUGH

05:35:55.902 --> 05:35:58.137
THAT LENS. IF WE HAVE TO MAKE

05:35:58.204 --> 05:35:59.138
CALIFORNIA MORE AFFORDABLE,

05:35:59.205 --> 05:36:01.241
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE

05:36:01.307 --> 05:36:02.141
COST OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE

05:36:02.208 --> 05:36:04.577
IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON THEIR

05:36:04.644 --> 05:36:05.478

LEGISLATURE LOOKING AT

05:38:09.235 --> 05:38:10.203

USE OF FUEL EFFICIENT CARS AND

05:38:23.316 --> 05:38:24.984
PROMOTE THE TRANSITION TO ZERO

05:38:25.051 --> 05:38:27.053
EMISSION VEHICLES, WHICH IS

05:38:27.120 --> 05:38:28.187
CRUCIAL TO MEETING OUR AIR

05:38:28.254 --> 05:38:29.922
QUALITY AND CLIMATE TARGETS SET

05:38:29.989 --> 05:38:31.290
BY STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. AND

05:38:31.357 --> 05:38:33.326
AS WE HEARD TODAY WITH STATES

05:38:33.393 --> 05:38:34.093
LIKE OREGON AND VIRGINIA ARE

05:38:34.160 --> 05:38:36.229
ALREADY DOING THIS WITH OREGON

05:38:36.295 --> 05:38:38.197
EXEMPTING ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

05:38:38.264 --> 05:38:39.966
CARS WITHIN MILE PER GAS ABOVE

05:38:40.033 --> 05:38:41.367
40 FROM PAYING SUPPLEMENTAL

05:38:41.434 --> 05:38:43.236
REGISTRATION FEES, AND WITH

05:38:43.302 --> 05:38:45.071
VIRGINIA TYING THE COST OF THE

05:38:45.138 --> 05:38:47.173
HIGHWAY USE FEE DIRECTLY TO THE

05:38:47.240 --> 05:38:48.007
VEHICLE FUEL ECONOMY AND

05:38:48.074 --> 05:38:50.243
EMPLOYING SIMILAR STRATEGIES

05:38:50.309 --> 05:38:51.844
WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS

05:38:51.911 --> 05:38:53.112
CLIMATE AND ZERO EMISSION

05:38:53.179 --> 05:38:55.081
TARGETS. ON THE CONTRARY,

05:38:55.148 --> 05:38:57.316
IMPLEMENTING A ROAD CHARGE FEE

05:38:57.383 --> 05:38:58.484
WITHOUT CONSIDERING FUEL

05:38:58.551 --> 05:39:00.420
EFFICIENCY WILL RESULT IN

05:39:00.486 --> 05:39:02.055
ADDITIONAL 45 MILLION TONS OF

05:39:02.121 --> 05:39:05.224
GHG EMISSIONS. AND WE ALSO WANT

05:39:05.291 --> 05:39:06.359
TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO URGE

05:39:06.426 --> 05:39:08.428
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

05:39:08.494 --> 05:39:09.362
AFFORDABILITY WHEN DESIGNING A

05:39:09.429 --> 05:39:11.497
ROAD CHARGE PROGRAM. LOW INCOME

05:39:11.564 --> 05:39:12.231
CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY

05:39:12.298 --> 05:39:14.200
STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR

05:39:14.267 --> 05:39:14.967
TRANSPORTATION COSTS, AND

05:39:15.034 --> 05:39:17.170
STUDIES SHOW THAT A FLAT ROAD

05:39:17.236 --> 05:39:18.771
CHARGE FEE WOULD INCREASE COSTS

05:39:18.838 --> 05:39:19.472
FOR THE POOREST URBAN

05:39:19.539 --> 05:39:23.209
HOUSEHOLDS BY $27 ANNUALLY, AND

05:39:23.276 --> 05:39:25.011
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

05:39:25.078 --> 05:39:27.380
CREATE A VARIABLE FEE STRUCTURE

05:39:27.447 --> 05:39:29.148
BASED ON INCOME TO ENSURE THAT

05:39:29.215 --> 05:39:31.117
WE'RE NOT FURTHER INCREASING

05:39:31.184 --> 05:39:32.351
THE ECONOMIC BURDEN ON LOW

05:39:32.418 --> 05:39:33.086
INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND

05:39:33.152 --> 05:39:34.187
FURTHERMORE, THE FUNDING

05:39:34.253 --> 05:39:36.222
GENERATED BY THIS MILEAGE FEE

05:39:36.289 --> 05:39:37.223
SHOULD GO TO PROGRAMS THAT MAKE

05:39:37.290 --> 05:39:39.392
IT EASIER FOR LOW INCOME

05:39:39.459 --> 05:39:40.226
HOUSEHOLDS TO ACQUIRE AN

05:39:40.293 --> 05:39:42.095
ELECTRIC VEHICLE, TO USE EV CAR

05:39:42.161 --> 05:39:44.163
SHARING, TO USE TRANSIT, BIKE

05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:46.532
AND WALK TO FURTHER HELP REDUCE

05:39:46.599 --> 05:39:47.233
REDUCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

05:39:47.300 --> 05:39:49.702
USING A VEHICLE. THANK YOU,

WANT TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS

05:40:00.713 --> 05:40:02.215
TODAY WITH PRINCIPLES, EQUITY

05:40:02.281 --> 05:40:03.249
PRINCIPLES SHARED BY THE

05:40:03.316 --> 05:40:05.251
CLIMATE PLAN COALITION, WHO

05:40:05.318 --> 05:40:07.220
ALSO ATTENDED THE HEARING BUT

05:40:07.286 --> 05:40:10.356
COULDN'T STAY FOR COMMENT. I

05:40:10.423 --> 05:40:12.325
THINK CLIMATE PLAN AND THE

05:40:12.391 --> 05:40:14.660
CENTER AND CLIMATE PLAN, WE

05:40:14.727 --> 05:40:16.395

YOU FOR THE PRESENTERS. I THINK

05:40:21.567 --> 05:40:23.035
THE THE CASE STUDIES THAT THEY

05:40:23.102 --> 05:40:24.203
PRESENTED WERE EXTREMELY

05:40:24.270 --> 05:40:25.838
HELPFUL IN HELPING OUR STATE TO

05:40:25.905 --> 05:40:28.441
EXPLORE OPTIONS OF WHAT, WHAT A

05:40:28.508 --> 05:40:29.509
WHAT A MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH

05:40:29.575 --> 05:40:31.110
COULD LOOK LIKE. I THINK SOME

05:40:31.177 --> 05:40:33.746
OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE

05:40:33.813 --> 05:40:35.915
SUPPORT ARE, YOU KNOW, A PHASED

05:40:35.982 --> 05:40:38.451
IN APPROACH THAT CONTINUES TO

05:40:38.518 --> 05:40:41.320
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO UPTAKE

05:40:41.387 --> 05:40:42.221
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND LOOK,

05:40:42.288 --> 05:40:44.957
LOOK TO THAT AS AN, AS AN, AS A

05:40:45.024 --> 05:40:47.193
GOAL, AS, AS AN OPTION TO HELP

05:40:47.260 --> 05:40:48.828
US MEET OUR CLIMATE AND CLEAN

05:40:48.895 --> 05:40:50.096
AIR GOALS. AND I ALSO WANT TO

STATE I'M FROM SOUTHERN

05:40:51.297 --> 05:40:53.199
CALIFORNIA, WHERE WE LOVE OUR

05:40:54.200 --> 05:40:56.202
CONTINUE TO BE AN OPTION, BUT

05:40:56.269 --> 05:40:57.703
WE ALSO WANT MORE

05:40:57.770 --> 05:40:59.906

THE EXPERTS TESTIFIED TO, WHICH

05:41:10.316 --> 05:41:11.984
IS THAT THIS FUNDING GAP IS

05:41:12.051 --> 05:41:14.120
ALSO DUE TO INFLATION, AND IT'S

05:41:14.187 --> 05:41:15.454
ALSO DUE TO INCREASING COSTS

05:41:15.521 --> 05:41:18.157
FOR LABOR AND CONSTRUCTION. AND

05:41:18.224 --> 05:41:20.393
