00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AGENDA. TEN YEARS AGO, WE

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:35.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTUALLY STARTED DOING A STUDY

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ON YOUNG WORKERS REALIZING HOW

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:39.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IMPORTANT THEY ARE TO

WORK FOR YOUNG WORKERS. ONE OF

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:51.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE THINGS WE FOUND IN THAT

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RESEARCH WAS THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

ENTIRE LIFETIME OF EARNINGS. AND

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:00.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE IMPORTANT

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:02.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR US TO LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS

00:42:02.519 --> 00:42:03.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND HOW IMPORTANT THOSE WAGES

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:07.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ARE FOR THE FUTURE OF

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY'RE WORKING 20 HOURS, 25, 30

00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:30.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO ON, WHICH STARTS TO HAVE

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:33.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON LEARNING.

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:36.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO STUDENTS ARE WORKING IN

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JOBS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO

00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:39.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR CAREERS. THEY'RE WORKING

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MORE HOURS. AND SO THE IMPACT OF

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:48.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORK IS SUBSTANTIAL. AND SO. YOU

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:50.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW, BEING AT A UNIVERSITY, YOU

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:51.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOW, WE WORK ACROSS THE, YOU

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KNOW, PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:55.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:57.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO CAPTURE THIS PARTICULAR STORY

00:44:57.728 --> 00:45:00.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF WORKERS AND LEARNERS AND SEE

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:02.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW, YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE ON

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:04.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE GROUND. AND ONE OF THE

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:06.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINGS ABOUT THE UCLA LABOR

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CENTER IS WE USE SOMETHING

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:09.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CALLED THE RESEARCH JUSTICE

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:10.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
APPROACH, WHICH IS REALLY TO

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:13.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CENTER WORKERS THEMSELVES IN

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:15.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAPTURING THE DATA, IN GUIDING

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:18.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUR RESEARCH. AND SO WE RUN A

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:19.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CLASS WHERE THE STUDENTS DEVELOP

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE SURVEYS, THE PRIORITY

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:23.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUESTIONS, THE CONDITIONS THAT

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:27.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY WANT TO UNPACK. AND SO I'M

00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:30.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE HERE FROM

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:32.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OUR LABOR SUMMER RESEARCH

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:35.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROGRAM, OUR ALUMNI, WHO OUR

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:38.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALUMNI WHO WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:40.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESEARCH LAST SUMMER ON WORKERS

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:41.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND LEARNERS. SO SHE'S GOING TO

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:44.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIG IN AND TELL YOU SOME OF THE

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:46.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONDITIONS THAT SHE EXPLORED IN

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:50.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR RESEARCH. AND FROM TALKING

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:52.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO HER, HER PEERS. AND SO THIS

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:57.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS HINA. THANK YOU. YEAH. SO I'M

00:45:57.788 --> 00:46:00.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:03.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COLLEGE GRADUATE. SO IT WAS AN

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:05.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:06.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THIS PROGRAM. AND THE LABOR

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDIES SUMMER RESEARCH PROGRAM.

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THIS PAST SUMMER, I JOINED 28

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OTHER STUDENT RESEARCHERS TO

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:14.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIVE INTO THE LIVED REALITIES OF

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:15.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHAT WE CALL WORKERS AND

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:16.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEARNERS. STUDENTS WHO, JUST

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIKE ME, KNOW THE CHALLENGE OF

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:20.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RUSHING FROM CLASS TO CLASS

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:23.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHILE ALSO WORKING. IN THE

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:27.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUMMER OF 2020. FOR MANY OF US,

00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:28.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SORRY, WE CENTERED STUDENT

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:30.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORKERS AS THE EXPERTS OF THEIR

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OWN EXPERIENCES. OVER A SHORT

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT INTENSIVE TIMELINE, WE

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:37.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONDUCTED 139 SURVEYS AND 26

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:40.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. ALL

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:41.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A PUBLIC

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:43.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY IN LA

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:44.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COUNTY AND WERE WORKING FOR PAY

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:47.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WERE OVER 18. AND WHILE OUR

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SAMPLE OVERREPRESENTS UCLA

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS, THE PATTERNS WE FOUND

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:52.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MIRROR CHALLENGES FACED BY

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:56.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORKERS AND LEARNERS STATEWIDE.

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:58.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO WE SURVEYED PEOPLE FROM ALL

00:46:58.882 --> 00:47:01.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KINDS OF DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
43% WERE LATINX OR HISPANIC, 30%

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:06.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ASIAN, 20% WHITE, 8%

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:09.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MULTIRACIAL, 7% BLACK, 4% MIDDLE

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EASTERN, SOUTH WEST ASIAN, NORTH

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:17.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AFRICAN, AND 3% OTHER. 63%

00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:21.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FEMALE, 32% MALE AND THEN 5%

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:22.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NON-BINARY. GENDER QUEER.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRANSGENDER. SO LIKE WE SAID, WE

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:28.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAD A OVERREPRESENTATION OF UCLA

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:32.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDENTS BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:35.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDENTS GO TO UCLA. SO THIS WAS

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:39.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN OUR CIRCLE. SO WHAT WE FOUND

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:40.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS CLEAR THERE'S AN ONGOING

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:44.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STRAIN ON STUDENT WORKERS FOR

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:45.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION MEANS

00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:47.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CONSTANTLY CHOOSING BETWEEN

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:48.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PAYING BILLS AND STAYING IN

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:52.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCHOOL. 65% EARN UNDER $15,000 A

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAR, AND AMONG THOSE RECEIVING

00:47:55.138 --> 00:47:57.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FINANCIAL AID, 63% SAY IT'S

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:58.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INSUFFICIENT AND THREE THIRDS

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:00.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO WORK STUDY.

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:01.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEARLY ONE THIRD HAD TO BORROW

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:03.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MONEY FOR ESSENTIALS SUCH AS

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:06.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RENT, FOOD OR TUITION, AND 43%

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:09.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAN'T COVER ALL THEIR EXPENSES,

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:11.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND 1 IN 4 HAVE FALLEN BEHIND ON

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:15.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILLS. THIS FINANCIAL PRESSURE

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DOESN'T JUST AFFECT BANK

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:18.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACCOUNTS, IT TOUCHES EVERY PART

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF A STUDENT'S LIFE. NEARLY

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:21.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THREE QUARTERS WORRY ABOUT

00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:23.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COVERING BASIC NEEDS ON A

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REGULAR BASIS. 71% HAVE WORKED

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:26.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHILE SICK BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:29.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AFFORD TO MISS A SHIFT. 42%

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:31.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REPORT WEEKLY ANXIETY, AND OVER

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:32.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
A THIRD EXPERIENCED DAILY

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANXIETY JUST FROM TRYING TO

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BALANCE COURSEWORK AND THEIR

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:40.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
JOBS. STUDENTS AREN'T JUST

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BALANCING SCHOOL AND WORK,

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:42.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY'RE BEING PULLED IN TWO

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:45.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DIRECTIONS AT ONCE. 85% IN OUR

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STUDY ARE FULL TIME STUDENTS,

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND TWO THIRDS WORK MORE THAN 15

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:50.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOURS A WEEK, WITH MANY WORKING

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:53.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OVER 30. AND FLEXIBLE JOBS OFTEN

00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:54.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
DEMAND ATTENDANCE OVER

00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:56.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACADEMICS, MAKING IT RISKY TO

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:58.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORK TO MISS WORK FOR CLASS OR

00:48:58.368 --> 00:49:00.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
STUDY TIME. A STUDENT I

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INTERVIEWED IN PARTICULAR

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:03.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATED, A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMPLAIN AT MY WORK AND THEY SAY

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE LINED UP

00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:10.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO FILL UP THOSE ROLES, SO IT

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE YOU

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES WHEN IT

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:14.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
COMES TO MISSING WORK OR

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:18.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRIORITIZING THAT OVER SCHOOL.

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:20.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVEN WITH ALL THAT EFFORT, THE

00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:23.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS WORK RARELY CONNECT TO

00:49:23.393 --> 00:49:24.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEIR CAREER GOALS. HALF OF

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:26.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS IN OUR STUDY SAID THAT

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEIR JOBS HAVE NO CONNECTION TO

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AFTER

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GRADUATION. SOCIAL SCIENCES AND

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:33.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STEM MAJORS MAKE UP THE MOST OF

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:35.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR PARTICIPANTS, YET ONLY 1 IN

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
5 HAVE JOBS ALIGNED WITH THOSE

00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:39.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIELDS. AS ONE STUDENT PUT IT, I

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE EITHER THIS CHOICE BETWEEN

00:49:41.845 --> 00:49:43.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE INTERNSHIP THAT IS NOT GOING

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:45.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO PAY ME, OR I HAVE THIS ON

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:47.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAMPUS JOB THAT'S DEFINITELY

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO PAY ME, IN SPITE OF THE

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:50.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FACT THAT IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:52.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YOUR CAREER IN THE PRESENT

00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:52.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MOMENT, YOU NEED TO SUPPORT

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:55.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOURSELF. AND SO WE ALSO FOUND

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT 55% OF STUDENT WORKERS

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RECEIVED NO WORKPLACE BENEFITS,

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:02.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND OVER A THIRD FEEL THEIR

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:03.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCHOOL HASN'T PREPARED THEM FOR

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A FUTURE JOB. SO THESE FINDINGS

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AREN'T JUST NUMBERS. THE

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:10.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REPRESENTATIVE OF A BIGGER

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

RUNNING OFTEN AT THE COST OF

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:20.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEIR OWN HEALTH. WHEN WORK AND

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EDUCATION CONFLICT, IT'S THE

00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:23.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS WHO PAY THE PRICE. AND

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

WE NEED TO CREATE PATHWAYS WHERE

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STUDENTS CAN SUCCEED IN BOTH

SCHOOL AND WORK WITHOUT BEING

GIVE US A WISH LIST? THERE'S

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THREE THINGS BY WAY OF

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:47.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEGISLATION YOU WOULD LIKE FOR

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:50.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
US TO LEGISLATE BASED ON YOUR

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:53.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIVED LIFE EXPERIENCE, THAT IF

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:57.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE CAN HAVE A MAGIC WAND TO MAKE

01:00:57.253 --> 01:01:00.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER BASED ON

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:03.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOUR LIVED LIFE EXPERIENCE,

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:08.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLEASE ARTICULATE THAT FOR US.

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:12.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I HAD MY MAGIC WAND. I WOULD

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:14.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXPAND STATE FUNDED WORK STUDY.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT ARE

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MIDDLE CLASS, AND THEY HAVE TO

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TAKE OUT LOTS OF LOANS AND WORK

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:22.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FULL TIME JUST TO PAY THEIR

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BILLS, AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:26.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T QUALIFY FOR WORK STUDY. SO

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:31.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I WOULD EXPAND THAT. ANOTHER ONE

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:33.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STATEWIDE INTERNSHIP TAX CREDIT

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:34.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO INCENTIVIZE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO HIRE STUDENTS IN RELEVANT

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIELDS, BECAUSE A BIG COST THAT

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE IS

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:43.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONBOARDING WORKERS. AND SO IF WE

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:44.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HAVE INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:45.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS IN FIELDS

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:48.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT ALIGN WITH THEIR CAREER

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:50.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOALS, THEN IT WILL OFFSET THAT

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COST AND ADJUSTING FINANCIAL AID

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FORMULAS TO REFLECT THE COST OF

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIVING. LIKE I SAID, THERE ARE

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:58.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO MANY STUDENTS THAT FALL JUST

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BETWEEN THAT THRESHOLD OF NOT

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEING LOW INCOME BUT NOT BEING

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UPPER CLASS. THEY'RE JUST RIGHT

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:03.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IN THE MIDDLE SO THEY DON'T

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:06.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUALIFY FOR AID. SO I ADJUST

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:10.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT AS WELL. SO ALL THREE OF

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:12.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THOSE, THEY WILL FALL UNDER MY

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMMITTEE BECAUSE I CHAIR THE

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:17.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THANK YOU. JUST TO ADD AND

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:24.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTUALLY THE LAST QUESTION THEY

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD ASK IN THEIR INTERVIEW TO

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:27.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS THAT THEY WERE SERVING

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAS IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND,

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE? SO THE

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:32.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINGS THAT YOU'RE HEARING IS

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ACTUALLY COMING FROM THAT

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VISION. I WOULD JUST ADD, YOU

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KNOW, THERE'S AB 800, WHICH

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STARTS EDUCATION OF WORKER

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RIGHTS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT, BECAUSE THE MORE WE CAN

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONTINUE TO, YOU KNOW, BY THE

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:50.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TIME FOLKS GET TO COLLEGE, IF

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:52.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY'RE NOT ALREADY KIND OF

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:53.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EDUCATED ABOUT MANAGING THEIR

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:56.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WORKPLACE, THE OTHER THING IS

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:57.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
JUST THE HIGH COST OF LIVING,

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RIGHT? LIKE THE JOBS JUST NEED

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:02.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO PAY MORE AND NOT TO KIND OF

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:03.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GET INTO THIS THING WHERE LIKE,

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:06.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW, ENTRY LEVEL JOBS OR

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:08.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRAINING JOBS DON'T DESERVE THE

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:13.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KIND OF SAME. COMPENSATIONS AS

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:15.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OTHERS. SO REALLY ALLOWING

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS TO WORK LESS, STUDENTS

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUALLY SAY, LIKE, WE SHOULD

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NOT BE WORKING AT ALL AND

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION SHOULD BE FREE. THAT,

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:24.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF COURSE, IS OUR LONG TERM

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:27.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
VISION IS HOW CAN WE MAKE

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:28.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EDUCATION AFFORDABLE AGAIN SO

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORK, BUT EVEN THOSE THAT HAVE

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:34.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENOUGH FINANCIAL AID STILL HAVE

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:35.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO PAY FOR THEIR LIVING COSTS.

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THAT THEN GOES TO HOUSING

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:39.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT GOES TO FOOD COSTS, AND

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT GOES TO ALL THE OTHER THINGS

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THEY HAVE TO CARRY. THANK

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:49.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU. SURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:52.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WELL ALWAYS EXPAND FUNDING

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALLOCATE SO THAT THE FUNDING IS

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:56.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT DUPLICATE. IT DOESN'T CREATE

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:57.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COMPETITION AMONGST OUR

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMMUNITY PROVIDERS SO THAT

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE ISN'T THAT DUPLICATION OF

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:02.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SERVICES, BUT RATHER ADDED VALUE

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AMONGST OURSELVES THAT ARE

BURDEN THEM WITH THE PROCESSING

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:05.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO GET ON THAT LIST. I'M GLAD

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:07.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
YOU SAID THAT, BECAUSE WE

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STARTED DOING A BILL MANDATING

ALL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA

REINTRODUCED THE TRADES BACK

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:18.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTO SCHOOLS. I CAME GREW UP IN

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:21.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A TIME WHERE IT WAS MANDATORY

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT WE HAD WOOD SHOP, METAL

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:26.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

OUT. WELL, I DIDN'T TAKE IT OUT,

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:34.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCHOOLS AND WE. DAVIS CHRONICLED

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A STUDY WHEN WE DID THAT. THAT'S

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:38.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHEN THE PIPELINE OPENED UP

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:41.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PROVIDE AN

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:42.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE STUDENTS

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:47.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHO DIDN'T HAVE A DESIRE TO GO

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:48.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:49.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNIVERSITY. THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:52.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANYTHING TO DO. AND WE LEFT

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:55.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOSE KIDS BEHIND. AND WE SHOULD

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:57.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE AMPLIFYING THE TRADES BECAUSE

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:59.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE LIVE IN A TECHNOLOGY AND WE

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:02.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DON'T HAVE KIDS OR STUDENTS

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TRAINED FOR THIS EMERGING

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S A

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:07.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DEMAND FOR THOSE KINDS OF

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TECHNOLOGY SCHOOLS AND THOSE

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:11.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRADES. AND WE SHOULD BE MAKING

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SURE THAT KIDS WHO DON'T WANT TO

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:17.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GO TO A TWO YEAR COMMUNITY

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:18.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
COLLEGE OR A FOUR YEAR

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:19.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNIVERSITY, WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:21.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SURE THEY'RE SET UP FOR SUCCESS

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THESE PARTICULAR AREAS, AND

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE SHOULD BRING THOSE TO THOSE

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:28.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SCHOOL LEVELS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MIDDLE SCHOOL, THAT'S WHERE IT

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STARTED. AND SO I AGREE WITH

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR.

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:40.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GIBSON. MISS PACHECO. YES. SO I,

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:43.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I, I DO HAVE A QUESTION. TAKING

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IT BACK TO OUR ALUMNI AND

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:49.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIRECTOR OF UCLA LABOR CENTER, I

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:52.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINK IT WAS TOUCHED UPON A

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATEWIDE TAX CREDIT. I THINK

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WAS ON ONE OF THE SLIDES

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:58.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS. CAN

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:01.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU ELABORATE MORE UPON ABOUT

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:11.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT? YEAH. YEAH. SO JUST TO WE

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:13.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROPOSE THE STATEWIDE INTERNSHIP

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:16.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TAX CREDIT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:18.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO HIRE

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:20.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STUDENTS. SO THIS WOULD OFFSET

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:22.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ONBOARDING COSTS WHILE ALSO

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:25.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENCOURAGING STUDENTS TO TAKE ON

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
JOBS THAT ALIGN WITH THEIR

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:29.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTENDED CAREER. AND THAT WOULD

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:32.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE LIKE, I KNOW THERE WERE THREE

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED TO

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIBSON. WOULD

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:39.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT FALL UNDER THE SECOND THE

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS? IS THAT

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHERE THAT TAX CREDIT WOULD FALL

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:46.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UPON? YES. YES. OKAY. AND IT IS

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:48.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TOUGH. I REMEMBER I HAD TO GO TO

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:51.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST BEFORE

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:54.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOING TO UCLA BECAUSE THE COST

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:55.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WAS SO HIGH. AND THEN I ENDED UP

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:57.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO LAW SCHOOL, WHICH IS A

01:07:57.973 --> 01:07:59.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRIVATE SCHOOL, AND I DID HAVE

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:03.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO TAKE OUT SOME SOME GRANTS AND

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:06.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOANS IN

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:08.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ORDER TO GET THROUGH LAW SCHOOL.

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:11.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT WELL OVER

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:14.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TEN, 15 YEARS TO PAY OFF MY

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:17.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DEBT. AND I HEARD NOW COST OF

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO PRIVATE SCHOOL AND EVEN

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAS EVEN GONE UP

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONSIDERABLY. SO I KNOW IT'S

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:27.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TOUGH BEING A STUDENT AND HAVING

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO DEAL WITH THE COST OF LIVING,

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:30.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WAS ABLE TO LIVE WITH MY

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:35.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PARENTS. SO I KNOW THAT'S THAT'S

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:38.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TOUGH. AND YEAH, THAT WAS

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:39.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ACTUALLY MY ONLY QUESTION

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:40.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S SO TOUGH ON

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDENTS. YEAH, SOMETHING THAT A

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOT OF STUDENTS AND I FOUND IS

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:45.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT A LOT OF INTERNSHIPS ARE

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNPAID. SO FOR ME PERSONALLY, I

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:50.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAD TO WORK TWO JOBS TO GET

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:51.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MYSELF THROUGH COLLEGE BECAUSE

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:52.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE OF THE JOBS I TOOK DIDN'T

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PAY MUCH. THANKFULLY IT WAS

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:56.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PAID, BUT NOT MUCH AT ALL. SO,

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
YOU KNOW, GIVING SMALL

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUSINESSES AND BUSINESSES AN

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:03.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCENTIVE THROUGH THE TAX CREDIT

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:06.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD REALLY HELP. ADD ONE MORE

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
QUESTION. WHEN I WAS IN LAW

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SCHOOL, I WORKED ON CAMPUS. IS

01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:12.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT STILL AN OPTION THAT IS

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:15.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BEING PROVIDED TO STUDENTS? I

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD SAY AT UCLA, ARE YOU ABLE

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:23.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO WORK ON CAMPUS? YES. OKAY.

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:24.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THANK YOU, MISS PACHECO. YOU

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WANT TO ASK SOMEBODY ELSE? I

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:30.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MEAN, YES, YES. AND WE FIND THAT

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:31.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IT'S BOTH LIKE SOMETIMES

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS NOT

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:34.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EVERYBODY CAN ACCESS THE WORK

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:35.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STUDY, WHICH GOES TO HINA'S

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OTHER FINDING ABOUT EXPANDING

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORK STUDY IN TERMS OF WHO CAN

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:41.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOT THAT YOU HAVE TO BE WORK

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:43.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STUDY FOR ON CAMPUS. BUT THOSE

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE TWO THINGS THAT GO TOGETHER

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:48.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT REALLY HELP STUDENTS. AND

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAMPUS JOBS TEND TO BE A LITTLE

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BIT MORE FLEXIBLE. BUT WE ALSO

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:53.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FIND THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING IN

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LA, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE WORKING IN

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:56.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE RETAIL STORES, THEY'RE

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:57.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WORKING IN THE RESTAURANTS,

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:59.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THEY'RE WORKING IN THE

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:02.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOSPITALS. SO, LIKE, HOW MUCH OF

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:04.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE JOBS AND MOST OF THEM ARE

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LOW WAGE, LOW PAYING JOBS. SO

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:09.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HANNAH'S POINT ABOUT WORKING

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:11.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MULTIPLE JOBS, THAT'S ALSO

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:13.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUITE COMMON, BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STILL TRYING TO FIND THAT SECOND

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:17.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JOB THAT WILL HELP YOUR CAREER

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE JOB THAT WILL HELP PAY

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:23.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE BILLS. WELL, ONE THING THE

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:24.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE TODAY,

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW, FOR THE LAST QUESTION

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:27.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT MY COLLEAGUE ASKED, I

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTUALLY WORKED ON CAMPUS ON MY

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UNDERGRAD AND THE OUTREACH

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:33.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OFFICE, AND IT WAS A FUN JOB

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:33.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE I GOT TO CALL STUDENTS,

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:35.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I WOULD TABLE AT DIFFERENT HIGH

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:37.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SCHOOLS, YOU KNOW, AND PROMOTE

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MY UNDERGRAD TO PROMOTE AND

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:41.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENCOURAGE STUDENTS. BUT MY WORK

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:42.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXPERIENCE THERE WAS, I WAS I

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WAS DOING A WORK STUDY ON

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CAMPUS, AND THAT WAS VERY

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HELPFUL. SO WHEN WE WERE PUTTING

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TOGETHER THE DIFFERENT

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE DEALING

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:53.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:55.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO MANY ISSUES AT THE STATE

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:56.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

BUSINESSES AND OUR CHAMBER OF

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMERCE. JUST LAST NIGHT WE

COMMUNITY IS BEING IMPACTED AT

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:50.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WITHOUT A

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DOUBT, I WANT TO ALSO

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING THAT'S

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:54.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERY HEAVY TO OUR DISTRICT. AND

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THESE

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:57.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RAIDS ARE HAPPENING IN OUR

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISTRICT AND OUR BACKYARD ARE

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:03.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE DISGUSTING, ARE HORRIBLE,

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:04.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD NOT

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LIVE IN FEAR. AND I SAY THAT

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:08.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH A HEAVY HEART BECAUSE THESE

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE OUR NEIGHBORS. THESE ARE THE

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PEOPLE THAT ARE SHOPPING IN OUR

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RESTAURANTS. WHEN IT STARTED

HAPPENING, RESTAURANTS, THE,

THE, THE TRAFFIC OF THESE

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RESTAURANTS WERE IMPACTED

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:20.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DRASTICALLY. AND THESE ARE NOT

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:21.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING.

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS THAT

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:23.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WE'RE DEALING WITH. SO

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:25.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING, I WANT

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:28.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DISTRICTS IN SOUTHERN

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CALIFORNIA, SPECIFICALLY IN

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARAMOUNT IN THESE COMMUNITIES

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ARE IMPACTED. AND SO THESE

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:34.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISCUSSIONS OF HOW WE DEAL WITH

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:37.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CRITICAL. SO I JUST DIDN'T WANT

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:38.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO MOVE FORWARD TO TODAY'S

SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU,

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:45.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THEIR BUSINESSES. MANY OF THEM

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:55.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING ENDS

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:57.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND WE'RE IN

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A DIRE SCENARIO. REALLY, THE

01:21:45.767 --> 01:21:47.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT SMALL

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:48.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUSINESSES IN LA ARE BEING HIT

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:51.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FROM ALL SIDES. COST AND

COMPETITION ARE UP, MARGINS ARE

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:55.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DOWN, AND EXTREME

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:56.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNPREDICTABILITY HAS BECOME THE

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:59.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NORM. AND IT ISN'T JUST A

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUSINESS ISSUE. THIS IS REALLY A

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

LOST, FAMILIES STRUGGLE, STATE

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:12.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TAX REVENUES DROP. THE ECONOMIC

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:14.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RIPPLE EFFECT OF ALL OF THIS IS

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:15.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROFOUND. AND THESE AREN'T

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:16.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LUXURY BUSINESSES WE'RE TALKING

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:17.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:29.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMUNITY LIFE AND THEIR RISK.

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WE KNOW BUDGETS ARE TIGHT AND

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:33.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT OUR STATE HAS PRIORITIZED

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:34.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING ISSUES

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:36.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS YEAR. BUT THIS IS ALL THE

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:38.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE REASON TO ALSO PRIORITIZE

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:42.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUSINESSES ARE OFTEN THE ONLY

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOURCE FOR PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:48.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE THINGS.

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:49.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IGNORING THE HEALTH OF

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:51.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESS WILL

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:53.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONLY INCREASE THE BURDEN TO OUR

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:55.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STATE. THIS IS WHY THE STATE

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:56.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MUST PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE. THIS

LIKE WALMART AND TARGET AND ALL

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:25.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE BIG BOYS, AND I REALLY

LEFT, WHO IS MY MENTOR FOR AND I

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH HIM WITH

01:26:33.755 --> 01:26:36.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE SBDC. HE WAS THE ONE WHO

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:39.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
KIND OF STARTED THIS WHOLE

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:40.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONCEPT UP OF MAMA OSSA AND LIKE

TO BE AND THAT REALLY THAT HOOK

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:47.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF WHAT WE STARTED AT IS WHAT

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:49.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MAMA ROSA IS TODAY. IT WAS THAT

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:51.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXPERIENCE OF GIVING PEOPLE

SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE.

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:56.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

AND THE SBDC PRIOR TO ME GETTING

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LAID OFF IN 2020, AND FROM THAT

JUST THINGS THAT WE SET ON

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:22.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

THE THINGS THAT I REALLY

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:25.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

ALLOWED ME TO GROW IN WAYS THAT

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:32.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TANK AND WAS PUT ON THE RESERVE

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LIST, LIKE AT THE 11TH HOUR,

01:27:57.572 --> 01:28:00.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHICH STILL HURTS TO THIS DAY.

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:03.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN 2022, I SOLD MY FIRST MILLION

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:05.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I HAVE HAPPY TO SAY THAT I

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:06.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BOOKED THAT FROM MY FRONT

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:09.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BREAKFAST NOOK. AND YOU KNOW,

01:28:09.183 --> 01:28:11.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHEN YOU'RE A TEAM OF ONE,

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY NICE TO

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:14.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUST CALL YOUR MENTOR AND TELL

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEM, HEY, GUESS WHAT? I BOOKED

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:17.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MY FIRST MILLION DOLLAR ORDER.

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:19.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO IT'S THINGS LIKE THAT THAT

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE JUST REALLY COOL TO SAY AND

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:22.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOT TO SAY THAT THOSE THINGS

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:24.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KEEP ON HAPPENING, BUT THAT IS

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:26.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE OF THE COOL THINGS THAT HAVE

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAPPENED. I ALSO HAVE EMPLOYED

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:30.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND MENTORED ABOUT 12 YOUTH

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:32.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AMBASSADORS, BUT ECONOMIC

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNCERTAINTY HAS REALLY CAUSED

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:37.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR SOME STRESSFUL TIMES. THESE

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IMPACTS OF MY BUSINESS FOR

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:40.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TARIFFS AND THE RISING COSTS,

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:43.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY HIT US AT EACH STEP OF THE

01:28:43.184 --> 01:28:45.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAY. SO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, THIS

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:48.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUMMER LEADING 200 KIDS AT CRAFT

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:50.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT SUMMER CAMP EACH WEEK, THERE

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:52.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WERE TIMES WHERE I WAS LIKE,

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'VE GOT TO PULL THE TRIGGER AND

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:55.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I HAVE TO START PLANNING MY

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:56.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUMMER. AND THERE WAS TIMES

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHERE I WAS LIKE, I CAN'T DO ANY

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:00.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF THAT. I AM 100% ON HOLD,

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:02.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAITING, WAITING, WAITING, AND

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:05.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEN REALIZING THAT SOME OF OUR

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MATERIALS INCREASED, SOME OF

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:09.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEM DOUBLED. AND I KNOW FOR A

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:11.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
FACT THAT SOME OF MY

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:12.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COUNTERPARTS, YOU KNOW, THEY

01:29:12.146 --> 01:29:14.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
JUST ABANDONED IMPORTING DUE TO

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:16.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT. BUT LIKE ME AND SOME OF MY

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MENTORS SAY, LIKE, I JUST ROLLED

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:20.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DICE AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I PUT EVERYTHING ON THE WATER

01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:24.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND IT DID END UP WORKING OUT. I

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:25.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOT ALL MY SUPPLIES ON TIME AND

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:27.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE THINGS THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:28.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I GOT RESOURCEFUL AND FIGURED IT

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUT, BUT MY MARGINS DEFINITELY

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:31.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DECREASED. LIKE I SAID, SOME OF

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:34.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE MATERIAL COSTS HAVE DOUBLED.

01:29:34.268 --> 01:29:36.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NOT

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:38.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERSONALLY RAISED MY PRICES ON

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:41.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MY WEBSITE FOR OVER THREE YEARS.

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:42.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS NOT

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:46.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MARGINS DECREASE, BUT IT'S

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE MY COMPETITION IS EITHER

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STAYING THE SAME OR LOWERING

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:50.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEIR COST, WHICH IN MY PERSONAL

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OPINION, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY FEED THEIR KIDS THAT WAY,

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:55.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:57.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PASS THOSE COSTS DOWN TO YOUR

01:29:57.692 --> 01:29:58.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CUSTOMERS. BUT WHAT I'VE

01:29:58.993 --> 01:30:01.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALIZED IS THAT I'M KEEPING MY

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:02.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PRICES. MY MARGINS ARE GOING

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:05.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOWN. SO MY HUSTLE HAS GONE UP.

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:07.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT YET, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:08.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE LIKE THERE'S SQUEEZING US

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:13.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AT EACH STEP OF THE WAY. SO

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:15.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LET'S SEE. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO

01:30:15.276 --> 01:30:16.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MENTION THAT ONE OF THE, THE

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:18.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REALLY GREAT THINGS THAT MAMA

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:20.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOES IS THAT WE WORK WITH TWO

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:22.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CORPORATE EVENT COMPANIES. WE

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:24.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOCUS ON TEAM BUILDING. AND LIKE

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I SAID, SOME OF THE OTHER

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:27.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COMPANIES AND COMPETITION,

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:29.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'VE STARTED TO LOWER THEIR

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:30.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PRICES. AND I JUST DON'T

01:30:30.491 --> 01:30:31.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S WORKING,

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT OUR COSTS

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:34.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT ARE INCREASING, BUT IT'S

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:36.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EACH STEP OF THE WAY, LIKE I

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:37.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MENTIONED. SO LIKE SHIPPING

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:38.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT BUYING AS

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MANY THINGS ON AMAZON AND SOME

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:42.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:45.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOING ON JUST IN OUR, IN OUR

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:47.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COUNTRY, OUR SHIPPING COSTS HAVE

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUALLY GONE UP ONE, TWO, $3

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:50.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR A BASIC GROUND SHIPMENT. AND

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR A SMALL COMPANY LIKE ME,

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S LIKE CRITICAL. THOSE THREE

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BUCKS MAKE A REALLY BIG

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:58.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DIFFERENCE. SO I FOCUS ON

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
OFFERING VALUE AND

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:02.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENTIATION, DIFFERENTIATING

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:05.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MY OWN SERVICES SO THAT WE

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:08.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUALLY STILL PROVIDE VALUE.

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:12.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXCUSE ME. SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:14.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
JUST REITERATE, LIKE HOW

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:16.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPORTANT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:19.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE SBDC IS. ALSO, YOU KNOW,

UP WITH THESE IDEAS AND I'M

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:25.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LIKE, HEY, ARI, YOU KNOW, I NEED

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:27.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO KNOW. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:29.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COST OR WHAT IT WHAT IT MEANS TO

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LICENSE OR TO DO FRANCHISING OR

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:32.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHATEVER. AND THAT IS THE NEXT

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:34.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STEP FOR MAMA, WHICH IS REALLY

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXCITING. I'M FIVE AND A HALF

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:37.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEARS IN BUSINESS. CANNOT EVEN

BELIEVE THAT. SO HAPPY TO SAY.

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:42.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT THAT'S OUR NEXT STEP IS OUR

LICENSING AND OUR FRANCHISE

YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT TO ASK THE

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:50.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FIRST QUESTION. DO YOU THINK

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:53.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT SO WE KNOW THAT WHAT'S

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:56.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TAKING PLACE IN WASHINGTON, DC

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:02.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON THE COST OF GOODS AND ON

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:04.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PRICES? I KNOW THAT IN YOUR

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:07.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TESTIMONY THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:10.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PRICING OUT THE BUSINESSES, A

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOT OF BUSINESSES BEING CLOSED

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:15.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE OF THE GOODS. GOODS ARE

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:17.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXPENSIVE INSURANCE, WILDFIRE

01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:18.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:20.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RIGHT. THE COST OF BUSINESS IN

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIA, IT'S EXPENSIVE TO DO

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:24.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA, RIGHT.

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:26.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AFFORDABILITY. THAT'S OUR NUMBER

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:28.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA AS

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:31.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POLICY MAKERS. THAT'S OUR THEME,

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:33.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AFFORDABILITY. TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:35.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:38.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TRYING TO LOOK AT OUR POLICIES

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:41.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

01:37:41.488 --> 01:37:44.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOESN'T FURTHER EXACERBATE IT TO

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:45.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BE TO BE MORE AND MORE

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:46.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EXPENSIVE. RIGHT. SO WE'RE

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKING AT THAT. AND THAT'S IN

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:50.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE FOREFRONT OF POLICIES,

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:51.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MYSELF AS THE CHAIR OF REVEREND

01:37:51.599 --> 01:37:54.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REVENUE AND TAXATION, I HAD TO

01:37:54.235 --> 01:37:57.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DO SOME UNPOPULAR THINGS TO A

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:59.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOT OF HOPE. NONE OF YOUR BILLS

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:02.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MEMBERS UP HERE. I HAD A WHOLE

01:38:02.943 --> 01:38:04.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOT OF BILLS. RIGHT. BECAUSE

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:05.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EVEN THOUGH THOSE THOSE BILLS

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:08.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ARE WELL INTENDED, WELL

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:10.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTENDED, WE FACED, YOU KNOW, A

01:38:10.784 --> 01:38:13.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BUDGET DEFICIT THAT WAS

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ASTRONOMICAL. I THINK IT WAS IT

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:17.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAS JUST A LOT OF MONEY. AND SO

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:19.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A LOT OF THE BILLS THAT CAME

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:20.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEFORE MY COMMITTEE COST A LOT

01:38:20.961 --> 01:38:24.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF MONEY. AND WERE A FURTHER

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:26.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXACERBATED OUR BUDGET DEFICIT.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO I HAD A WHOLE LOT OF BILLS,

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:30.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH WAS A PRUDENT THING TO DO.

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:32.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THAT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:35.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS THE CHAIR IN OUR COMMITTEE.

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:38.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:41.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T

01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:44.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FURTHER, YOU KNOW, WHILE TRYING

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:46.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET, YOU KNOW,

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FURTHER EXACERBATE THAT. AND SO

01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:50.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MY POINT BEING IS THAT, YOU

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:52.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE, YOU KNOW,

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:53.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WILDFIRES WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:55.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S STUFF THAT WE'RE DEALING

01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:59.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND IN COST

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:02.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF INSURANCE. HOW DO WHAT DO YOU

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:05.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUGGEST WE DO AS A STATE TO

01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:07.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:10.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FROM YOUR LENS? AS A, YOU KNOW,

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:13.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS, AS A BUSINESSMAN, GIVE US

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:14.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD

01:39:14.915 --> 01:39:18.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BE LOOKING AT AS POLICY MAKERS

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:19.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK TO

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SACRAMENTO AND REALLY FOCUS IN

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:23.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ON. YEAH. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:26.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MEMBER, FOR THAT QUESTION. SO IN

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:28.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

OUR SORT OF ENTIRE ASSEMBLY TO

REALLY THINK ABOUT SMALL

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:37.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUSINESS AS A REVENUE GENERATOR.

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:39.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:40.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PAY FOR ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:43.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WANT

TO SUPPORT TO HAVE THE AMAZING

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALIFORNIA, WE KNOW IT CAN BE

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:47.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INVESTING IN SMALL BUSINESSES,

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:49.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW WE GET THERE, THAT REALLY IS

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:51.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF OUR

01:39:51.585 --> 01:39:54.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATE. AND ALL OF THESE THINGS

01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:55.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TIE BACK TO SMALL BUSINESS, YOU

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:57.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
KNOW, HEALTHY COMMUNITIES.

01:39:58.058 --> 01:39:59.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE A GREAT

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:01.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAIN STREET THAT'S THRIVING,

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:02.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GET HEALTH

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:04.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CARE, PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:07.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AFFORD HOMES, SMALL BUSINESS

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:08.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DRIVES A LOT OF THAT. THAT'S

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:10.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHERE YOU GET GOOD JOBS. THAT'S

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:11.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHERE YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, GOOD

01:40:12.005 --> 01:40:14.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMUNITIES. AND SO I WOULD NOT

01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:16.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NECESSARILY LOOK AT ANYTHING,

01:40:16.377 --> 01:40:17.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW, IN THAT STACK OF BILLS

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:19.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT'S

01:40:19.747 --> 01:40:22.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AROUND SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT AS

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE SAME AS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:25.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT MIGHT BE, YOU KNOW, A

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:26.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROGRAM

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S, YOU KNOW, SORT OF THE

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:30.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NICE TO HAVE TYPE OF THING.

01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:31.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SMALL BUSINESS REALLY IS AN

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:33.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ECONOMIC GENERATOR. SO I WOULD

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
START FROM THERE AND TO ADDRESS

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:37.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE QUESTION OF DISASTER, MAKING

01:40:37.931 --> 01:40:40.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SURE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES CAN

01:40:40.267 --> 01:40:41.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WEATHER OUR STATE'S DISASTERS,

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:43.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH ARE NOW JUST A NORMAL PART

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:45.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF BUSINESS, IS CRITICAL. IF

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:47.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT, THAT BURDEN THEN GOES BACK

01:40:47.775 --> 01:40:49.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONTO THE STATE. AND SO I THINK

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:53.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAN DO. ONE IS JUST ENSURE THAT

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:55.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OUR BUSINESSES HAVE MORE

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:58.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PREPAREDNESS. AND I THINK I HAVE

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:00.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TO GIVE CREDIT TO CLAIRE

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:02.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHITMER, WHO'S PART OF THE

01:41:02.456 --> 01:41:03.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF SMALL

01:41:03.557 --> 01:41:05.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUSINESS ADVOCATE. SHE SHARED AN

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:08.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IDEA OF, WELL, MAYBE WE CAN

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:09.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CREATE AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:12.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHERE YOUR INSURANCE RATES GO

01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:13.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOWN. IF YOU DEMONSTRATE THAT

01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:16.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH DISASTER

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:17.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PREPAREDNESS TRAINING AND YOU'VE

01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:18.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CREATED MEASURES IN YOUR

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:20.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUSINESS WHERE YOU CAN WEATHER

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:21.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINGS, YOU KNOW, WHY NOT CREATE

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:23.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME INCENTIVES THAT OUR STATE.

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:27.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO JUST ONE POINT. SO I CARRIED

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:31.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A BILL IN 2022. IT WAS THE LOS

MEMBER IN OUR STATE HAS AN SBDC

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:40.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT COVERS THEIR REGION, AND

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:42.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER PROGRAMS

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:44.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

CHALLENGED WITH. WE'RE NOT

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:59.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

PACHECO. SO, I DO HAVE A

01:44:54.855 --> 01:44:56.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUESTION. YOU KNOW, BEING HAVING

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:58.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEEN RECENTLY AND WORKING IN THE

01:44:58.492 --> 01:44:59.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LOCAL BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH

01:44:59.526 --> 01:45:01.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE CHAMBER, ONE OF THE THINGS

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:03.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT A LOT OF US IN THAT IN THAT

01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:05.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPACE COUNCIL MEMBERS, LEADERS

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:07.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE ALWAYS PROMOTE, BUY LOCAL,

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:09.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SHOP LOCAL, RIGHT. IN FACT, THAT

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:11.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAS ONE OF THE ACTUAL THEMES IN

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:12.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
LAKEWOOD RECENTLY, MOST

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:15.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RECENTLY. SO THE QUESTION THAT I

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE IS,

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:19.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
YOU KNOW, HOW HOW HOW ARE

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:21.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONSUMERS RESPONDING TO THAT?

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:24.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUY LOCAL, SHOP LOCAL IN SUPPORT

01:45:24.184 --> 01:45:26.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF BOTH SMALL BUSINESSES

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:26.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REGARDING THE MOVEMENTS IN LIGHT

01:45:26.953 --> 01:45:30.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF RISING IMPORT COSTS AND

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:34.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INTERNATIONAL TRADE TENSIONS?

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:35.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS WOULD JUST BE, YOU KNOW,

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KIND OF AN ANECDOTAL RESPONSE

01:45:37.597 --> 01:45:38.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE HARD DATA

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:41.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEHIND IT, BUT IT FEELS LIKE

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:42.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:44.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERSIONS OF THIS, AND THEY TEND

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:48.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE ONE OFFS. I WOULD SAY, YOU

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:50.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOW, MAYBE SORT OF ANCHORING

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:51.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT, YOU KNOW, WITH, YOU KNOW,

01:45:51.945 --> 01:45:53.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVING ALL OF THE CITIES IN A

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REGION GET TOGETHER OR I KNOW

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:57.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LA COUNTY DOES THIS, MAYBE

01:45:57.517 --> 01:45:59.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE THEM PARTNER WITH CITIES

01:45:59.352 --> 01:46:01.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND MAKE IT A MUCH BIGGER DEAL

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:02.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COLLECTIVELY? I THINK THAT WOULD

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE. I THINK

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:06.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S A LOT OF GOODWILL BEHIND

01:46:06.359 --> 01:46:08.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THIS, AND WHEN IT DOES GET

01:46:08.328 --> 01:46:09.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ATTENTION, YOU DO SEE A LITTLE

01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:11.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BIT OF A BUMP, BUT THEN

01:46:11.598 --> 01:46:12.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVERYBODY GETS BUSY AND GOES

01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:14.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BACK TO THEIR NORMAL THINGS. AND

01:46:14.534 --> 01:46:17.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO I THINK MAYBE THE STATE

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUPPORTING A MUCH BROADER AND

01:46:19.806 --> 01:46:23.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SORT OF ONGOING CAMPAIGN, AND IN

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:25.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GETTING THE CREATIVITY OF SMALL

01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:26.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUSINESSES, I MEAN, MAYBE THEY

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAN COME UP WITH, I DON'T KNOW,

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:31.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS OR DISCOUNTS

01:46:31.284 --> 01:46:32.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OR, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT MIGHT

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:34.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TAKE TO SORT OF CAPTURE THE

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:35.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IMAGINATION OF THE LOCAL

01:46:35.655 --> 01:46:36.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMUNITY, TO KEEP THAT ROLLING

01:46:36.923 --> 01:46:39.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND KEEP IT GOING. THANK YOU.

01:46:39.793 --> 01:46:41.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND MAYBE TO THE REST OF THE

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:43.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PANELISTS, YOU KNOW, WE DEAL A

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:44.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LOT WITH BRICK AND MORTAR

01:46:44.464 --> 01:46:45.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BUSINESSES, OF COURSE,

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:46.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:47.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOMETIMES WE FORGET ABOUT THOSE

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:48.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT ARE NOT BRICK AND MORTAR

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:50.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ARE DOING, YOU KNOW, ONLINE

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:52.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SALES THAT ARE DOING FROM HOME,

01:46:52.105 --> 01:46:53.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT ARE DOING THOSE TYPE OF

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:55.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUSINESSES. SO IS THERE ANYTHING

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:56.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THE STATE COULD DO MORE TO

01:46:56.743 --> 01:46:57.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUPPORT THOSE TYPE OF BUSINESSES

01:46:57.844 --> 01:47:01.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE? I THINK

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:04.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT IN LIEU OF NOT HAVING AN

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:05.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THE

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:07.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR

01:47:07.687 --> 01:47:10.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUSINESSES HAVE, THE STATE COULD

01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:12.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
INVEST IN CREATING AND

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:15.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUPPORTING A NETWORK OF MICRO

01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:17.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
BUSINESSES, MICRO

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT BUILDS

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:20.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAPACITY, THAT ENGAGES WITH EACH

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:23.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OTHER, THAT ALSO HELPS LEVERAGE

01:47:23.403 --> 01:47:25.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR COLLECTIVE BUYING POWER.

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:28.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT NEEDS TO BE AN INTENTIONAL

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:28.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STRATEGY THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:47:29.009 --> 01:47:30.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FUNDED. BECAUSE DOING OUTREACH

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:33.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IS ONE ELEMENT OF IT. BUT

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:35.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MAINTAINING THAT KIND OF

01:47:35.182 --> 01:47:37.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COLLECTIVE, EVEN INFORMATION

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:39.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUILDING, SHARING INFORMATION

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:41.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WITH COMMUNITY AND HAVING A

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:42.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FEEDBACK LOOP WHERE SOME OF THE

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:44.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MICRO ENTREPRENEURS ARE ACTUALLY

01:47:44.524 --> 01:47:45.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TELLING YOU WHAT THEY NEED AND

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:48.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW THEY CAN GROW. I THINK THAT

01:47:48.662 --> 01:47:50.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KIND OF TRADITIONAL STRATEGY

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WOULD BE IMPORTANT OF JUST

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:54.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVING A NETWORK. A LOT OF THESE

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:55.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NOT

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:57.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PART OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE, SO

01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:58.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE

01:47:58.905 --> 01:48:01.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRADITIONAL BUSINESS COMMUNITY,

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:02.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND THERE DOESN'T EXIST A

01:48:03.043 --> 01:48:04.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT'S

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:05.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOCUSED ON MICRO BUSINESSES. A

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:07.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOT OF THEM ARE SUPPORTING EACH

01:48:07.547 --> 01:48:10.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OTHER AND SUPPORTING THEIR WORK,

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:13.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR EXAMPLE, WITH PEOPLE WHO

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:16.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE THEIR BUSINESSES AND ARE

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:18.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOOD VENDORS, FOR EXAMPLE. THEY

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:20.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE A NETWORK. MANY OF THEM ARE

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:22.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PLACE BASED. SO BY COMMUNITY,

01:48:22.829 --> 01:48:24.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SOME OF THEM ARE BY THEIR

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:27.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN ALSO. SO I

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:29.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK THAT HAVING USING WHAT'S

01:48:29.469 --> 01:48:30.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WORKED FOR TRADITIONAL

01:48:30.904 --> 01:48:32.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BUSINESSES, FOR MICRO

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:33.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BUSINESSES, I THINK IS

01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:35.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IMPORTANT, AND ALSO THINKING

01:48:35.208 --> 01:48:36.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXPANSIVELY ABOUT OTHER WAYS OF

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:38.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
REACHING AND ENGAGING AND

01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:40.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STAYING IN TOUCH WITH THOSE

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:42.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MICRO BUSINESSES IS IMPORTANT.

01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:45.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THANK YOU. ARI. YES. ONE OF THE

01:48:45.785 --> 01:48:47.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:49.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAW IN BEING A MICRO BUSINESS OR

01:48:49.256 --> 01:48:50.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A SMALLER BUSINESS IS THE ACT OF

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:52.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BEING CONVENIENT, RIGHT? IT'S

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:54.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EASIER TO ORDER ONLINE AND JUST

01:48:54.327 --> 01:48:56.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE THE PRODUCT SHOW UP. BUT

01:48:56.129 --> 01:48:58.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
GOING BACK TO PAT AND

01:48:58.331 --> 01:48:59.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PACHECO'S IDEA OF

01:48:59.766 --> 01:49:01.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
REALLY SHARING OUR PUBLIC

01:49:01.568 --> 01:49:03.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NARRATIVE OF THE SBDC AND BEING

01:49:03.436 --> 01:49:05.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTIVATED ALLOWS FOR THE OTHER

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:06.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUSINESSES TO SEE THE WORK THAT

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:08.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE DO AND HAVE A LONGER REACH.

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:10.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE WHEN I MENTIONED YOU'RE

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT ALONE, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:13.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE'S OTHER BUSINESSES HAVE

01:49:13.346 --> 01:49:14.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEEN THROUGH IT, AND THERE'S A

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:16.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL HELP AND

01:49:16.316 --> 01:49:17.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ELEVATE THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER.

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:19.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW, RISING TIDE RAISES ALL

01:49:19.486 --> 01:49:21.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SHIPS. BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:21.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NARRATIVE OF REALLY KNOWING THAT

01:49:21.988 --> 01:49:23.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE SBDC IS OUT HERE AS A

01:49:23.623 --> 01:49:25.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SERVICE IS A BIG, BIG, BIG STEP

01:49:25.992 --> 01:49:27.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN PUSHING THE FOOT FORWARD.

01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:29.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE, I MEAN, LET'S LOOK AT

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:31.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UBER. UBER ALLOWED YOU TO BUY

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:33.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOUR TIME BACK, RIGHT? IT'S

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:33.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUCCESSFUL HERE. ONE OF THE

01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:35.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHALLENGES THAT SMALL BUSINESSES

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:36.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FACE IS CONVENIENCE, RIGHT? WE

01:49:36.836 --> 01:49:38.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE TO GET YOUR

01:49:38.638 --> 01:49:39.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GROCERIES. WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:41.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEAVE TO DO THESE THINGS. BUT

01:49:41.474 --> 01:49:42.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HUMAN INTERACTION IS STILL VERY

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:43.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PREVALENT IN THE RETAIL BUSINESS

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:45.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR

01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:47.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUSINESS. AND IT'S NEVER GOING

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:47.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO GO AWAY. YOU KNOW, ONLINE

01:49:47.847 --> 01:49:50.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SALES IS GOING TO BE THERE, BUT

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:51.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HUMAN INTERACTION IS NEVER GOING

01:49:51.184 --> 01:49:52.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO GO. AND IF WE CAN KEEP

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:55.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOCUSING ON THAT AND TELLING OUR

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:55.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STORY, I THINK THAT'S A BIG WIN

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:57.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. I WANT

01:49:57.357 --> 01:50:00.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO SHARE AN OBSERVATION IN OUR

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:02.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEARS OF DOING ORGANIZING AND

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:03.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORK WITH

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS,

01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:06.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OBVIOUSLY, WE DO A LOT OF WORK

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:08.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY AND

01:50:08.568 --> 01:50:10.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH SPANISH SPEAKING BUSINESS

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:14.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OWNERS. A LOT OF THEM SEE THEIR

01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:17.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORK AS IMPORTANT, BUT THEY WILL

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:20.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAY THINGS LIKE TRABAJO POR MI

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CUENTA, WHICH IS I WORK ON MY

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OWN. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SEE

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:26.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEMSELVES AS MICRO BUSINESSES,

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:30.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND OUR WORK HAS BEEN TO EDUCATE

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:31.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEM THAT TRABAJANDO POR LA

01:50:31.858 --> 01:50:33.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CUENTA ES EMPRESARIO YOU ARE OR

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:35.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AN EMPRENDEDOR OR EMPRENDEDORA.

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:37.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU ARE IN FACT AN ENTREPRENEUR

01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:39.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING FOR

01:50:39.232 --> 01:50:40.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOURSELF. AND SO I THINK THAT

01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:43.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STATE CAN REALLY DO A LOT OF

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:45.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY INNOVATIVE WORK IN TERMS

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:46.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT

01:50:47.007 --> 01:50:49.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IS AN ENTREPRENEUR? AN

COMMUNITY AT LARGE. WHAT WE DO

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:34.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN GIVING OUR KIDS THE TOOLS TO

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:36.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GET THROUGH THE TRAUMA OF

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:38.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVERYTHING GOING ON. AND LET'S

EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON OUT

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:44.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S

01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:46.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALLY AFFECTING OUR FAMILIES,

01:58:46.452 --> 01:58:49.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE RESULT OF THAT IS GOING

01:58:49.155 --> 01:58:50.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO BE INCREASING CRIME, DRUG

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:53.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
USE, EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT IF WE

01:58:53.359 --> 01:58:55.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CAN GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:56.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
