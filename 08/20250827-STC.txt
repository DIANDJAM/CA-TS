CARBON FUEL STANDARD, MORE

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:50.040

I'M SORRY, LCFS IS DESIGNED TO

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:54.812
ENCOURAGE THE USE OF LOW CARBON

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:55.613
TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.748
CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

00:41:57.815 --> 00:41:59.717
AND ACHIEVE AIR QUALITY

00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:01.752
STANDARDS AT A TIME WHEN

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:03.487
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICIES

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:06.090
AND TOOLS ARE BEING ATTACKED BY

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.524
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE NEED

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:10.060
TO RETAIN A SUITE OF TOOLS TO

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:11.462
PROTECT THE HEALTH OF

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:12.696
CALIFORNIANS AND CONTINUE TO

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:14.965
MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD OUR

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.634
CLIMATE GOALS. PEOPLE HAVE

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.637
QUESTIONED IF LCFS LCFS

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:21.538
CONTRIBUTES TO GAS PRICES IN

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:24.174
CALIFORNIA, AND, IF SO, BY HOW

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.977
MUCH. THE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:28.746
TO POSE TODAY IS IF PEOPLE ARE

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:31.615
PAYING MORE AT THE PUMP FOR A

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:33.751
GALLON OF GASOLINE, ARE THE

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:35.619
BENEFITS WORTH THE COST? ONE

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:38.422
EXAMPLE I USE REGULARLY AS WE

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:40.057
TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY IN THE

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:40.958
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:43.494
IT HAS BEEN A PRIME TOPIC IS

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.663
THE FACT THAT MOST OF US WHO

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:47.665
DRINK COFFEE CAN MAKE COFFEE AT

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:49.700
HOME FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLARS.

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:51.602
HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF COFFEE

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:53.604
DRINKERS GO TO STARBUCKS. THEY

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:56.073
GO TO PEET'S, THEY GO TO THAT

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.608
LOCAL COFFEE SHOP. WHY? BECAUSE

00:42:57.675 --> 00:43:00.711
THEY FIND VALUE IN GOING TO

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.479
THAT LOCAL COFFEE SHOP. NOW

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:03.847
THEY'RE GOING TO PAY A LOT MORE

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.516
THAN WHAT THEY DO, AS IF THEY

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:07.618
DO IT AT HOME. BUT THEY SEE

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.453
SOME LEVEL OF BENEFIT, WHETHER

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.788
IT'S THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GO

00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:11.755
HANG OUT WITH FOLKS, ENGAGE,

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:13.757
JUST BE IN THE PUBLIC AND GET

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:15.459
OUT OF YOUR PJS. OR IS IT TO

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.628
SEE THAT BARISTA MAYBE HOPING

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:19.563
FOR A DATE? OR IS IT TO YOU

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.132
LIKE THE FOAM ON TOP WITH THE

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:23.434
HEART OR SOME SOME PREFERENCE?

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.969
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:27.438
GETTING YOUR CAFFEINE FROM A

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:28.572
PLACE THAT IS WAY MORE

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:30.607
EXPENSIVE THAT YOU FIND VALUE.

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:32.343
AND IT IS ABOUT TIME WE HAVE A

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:33.477
REAL CONVERSATION IN THE STATE

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.646
OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT WHAT THINGS

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:37.848
COST, AND DO THEY LIVE UP TO

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:39.183
THE VALUE? DO THEY PROVIDE A

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:41.852
BENEFIT? AND IF THEY DO,

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:42.820
PROCEED? BUT HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.722
THAT BENEFIT IF THEY DON'T? OR

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:45.456
HOW DO WE ELIMINATE IF IT

00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:46.724
DOESN'T PROVIDE A BENEFIT AT

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.993
ALL? AND I THINK WHEN WE TALK

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:50.961
ABOUT TODAY ABOUT THE COST OF

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:53.430
LCFS, REALLY, IT'S ABOUT THE

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:55.532
COST OF THE ADDED VALUE TO

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.634
CALIFORNIANS. AND IS THERE ANY

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:58.969
AND HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE IF

00:43:59.036 --> 00:44:01.939
POSSIBLE. SO YOU'LL HEAR FROM

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.741
SPEAKERS TODAY. THE LCFS

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:05.709
PROVIDES A MYRIAD OF BENEFITS

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.111
TO CALIFORNIANS, INCLUDING

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:08.412
FUNDING FOR ZERO EMISSION

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.848
VEHICLES AND PUBLIC TRANSIT

00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:11.749
PROJECTS, A REDUCTION IN

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.417
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.586
REDUCING LOCAL POLLUTANTS SUCH

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.454
AS DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. I

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:18.655
LOOK FORWARD TO THESE

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.724
DISCUSSIONS TODAY AND HAVING A

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:22.559
REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:24.795
COMPLEX YET BENEFICIAL PROGRAM.

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.630
WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO TURN IT

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:29.233
OVER TO MY CO CHAIR,

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:30.768
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALVAREZ, FOR HIS

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.603
OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU,

00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:34.605
MADAM CHAIR, AND GOOD AFTERNOON

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:36.573
TO EVERYBODY. IT'S GREAT THAT

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.509
OUR DAY HAS FINALLY COME ON

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:39.343
THIS CONVERSATION. CERTAINLY

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:42.579
WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER FOR

00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:44.415
CONVENING THIS. IT WAS VERY,

00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:46.083
VERY CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.818
THAT SPEAKER RIVAS WANTED TO

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:50.454
MAKE SURE WE FOCUSED ON

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.389
AFFORDABILITY AT ALL LEVELS OF

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:54.792
THAT. WE HAVE SOME CONTROL

00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:56.794
UNDER, AND CERTAINLY IN THE

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.429
TRANSPORTATION SPACE AND IN THE

00:44:58.495 --> 00:44:59.730
ENERGY SPACE. THAT HAS BEEN A

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:02.332
CONCERN FOR CALIFORNIANS, AND

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:02.933
RIGHTFULLY SO. WE ARE FOCUSED

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.668
ON THAT AND DISCUSSING THAT.

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:07.271
IT'S REALLY, I THINK I WOULD

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:08.872
CALL IT A MOMENT OF RECKONING

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:10.374
WHERE WE NEED TO DETERMINE VERY

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.376
MUCH IN LINE WITH THE COMMENTS

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:14.578
OF OUR CO CHAIR, MISS WILSON,

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:17.581
THAT WE NEED TO REALLY DECIDE

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:20.017
THIS MOMENT OF RECKONING IS A

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:21.418
DECISION ON ENERGY POLICIES AND

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:24.688
WHAT THE COSTS ARE, AND HOW WE

00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:26.423
COMPARE THAT TO THE BENEFITS,

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.659
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR, I

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:29.526
THINK CALIFORNIANS WANT TO MAKE

00:45:29.593 --> 00:45:32.996
SURE THAT WE MOVE TO A CLEANER

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:34.798
ENVIRONMENT THAT ADDRESSES THE

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:37.101
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.803
WE ALL WANT TO GET THERE. AND I

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.571
THINK THE CONVERSATION IS ABOUT

00:45:40.637 --> 00:45:43.841
HOW DO WE GET THERE BEST IN A

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.610
WAY THAT DOESN'T OVERLY BURDEN

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:47.878
CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR COST OF

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:50.581
LIVING. THAT'S BEEN A KEY

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:51.048
CONSIDERATION IN THESE

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:52.583
DISCUSSIONS. SO THAT IS OUR

00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:55.052
CENTRAL FOCUS IN THE ASSEMBLY.

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:57.087
THE DIRECTIVE IS VERY, VERY

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:57.688
CLEAR FROM OUR SPEAKER, WHICH

00:45:57.754 --> 00:45:59.690
IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE

00:45:59.756 --> 00:46:00.991
COST OF LIVING REMAINS

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:02.059
AFFORDABLE FOR CALIFORNIANS?

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:03.727
THAT IS HOW WE OPEN THIS YEAR'S

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:05.762
SESSION WITH THE SPEAKER ON DAY

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:06.630
ONE. AND THAT HAS BEEN THE

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:09.099
FOCUS, AND THAT IS THE FOCUS OF

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:10.734
THIS CONVERSATION. I WANT TO

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:11.702
THANK ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE HAD

00:46:11.768 --> 00:46:13.604
AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALREADY SHARE

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:14.838
SOME OF THAT OVER THE LAST

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:16.540
COUPLE OF MONTHS SINCE THIS

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:18.642
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN FORMED AND

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:20.444
ANNOUNCED. I REALLY WANT TO

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:23.313
THANK OUR CO-CHAIR FOR BEING A

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.283
TREMENDOUS VALUE AND ASSET IN

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:27.818
THIS CONVERSATION. I CERTAINLY

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.419
HAVE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH THIS

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:30.621
CONVERSATION. THERE IS A LOT TO

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:32.789
LEARN. THAT IS MY HOPE THAT

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:33.457
WITH TODAY'S HEARING THAT

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:35.592
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS, THAT

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:36.793
CALIFORNIANS AND OTHERS LEARN

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.463
ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS,

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.465
WHAT IT DOES, AND PERHAPS WHAT

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:44.568
IT DOES NOT DO, AND THEN

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.737
TOGETHER, BY BEING INFORMED, BY

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:48.572
HAVING THE FACTS AND BY HAVING

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.073
QUESTIONS ANSWERED, WE CAN MAKE

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.975
A BETTER DECISION BY THE END OF

00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:53.710
TODAY, I HOPE, AND IN THE

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:54.912
COMING DAYS, CERTAINLY AS A

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:56.480
RESULT OF THIS HEARING, AS TO

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:57.714
WHERE WE'RE GOING, BECAUSE I

00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:00.450
THINK WHERE WE WANT TO GO IS A

00:47:00.517 --> 00:47:01.685
CLEANER CALIFORNIA, BUT ALWAYS

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:03.921
WITH A MINDSET THAT IT HAS TO

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:06.490
BE DONE IN A WAY THAT TAKES OUR,

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:07.724
OUR CONSUMERS AND OUR OUR

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:09.960
CITIZENS INTO ACCOUNT IN TERMS

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:12.663
OF WHAT THAT COST IS. SO, AGAIN,

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.431
JUST WANT TO WANT TO THANK YOU

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.766
ALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:17.401
BE SPEAKING, CERTAINLY HAVE

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:18.602
QUESTIONS FOR YOU. THAT'S

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.938
PROBABLY NOT A SURPRISE, BUT

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:22.539
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:23.640
AND AGAIN, THANK YOU, MADAM

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:26.743
CHAIR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.712
NOW I'LL GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.113
FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECT

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.815
COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE THEIR

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:34.618
OPENING REMARKS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.553
LACKEY. YEAH, CERTAINLY. LET ME

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.690
JUST BEGIN BY SAYING LCFS IS

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:41.391
ACTUALLY AN EXPLETIVE IN MY

00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:45.529
DISTRICT. AND IT'S HATED. IT'S

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:49.099
ABSOLUTELY HATED. AND THE CHAIR

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:49.800
IS ACTUALLY EXPLAINED. THE

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:52.669
REASON WHY IS BECAUSE WE TALK

00:47:52.736 --> 00:47:55.706
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING

00:47:55.772 --> 00:47:59.076
THIS, BUT WE DON'T REALLY

00:47:59.142 --> 00:48:02.246
MENTION A SPECIFIC BENEFIT. AND

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:05.082
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS EXPENDITURE,

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:06.683
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.885
DISTRICT LIKE MINE WHERE THE

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:11.455
AVERAGE INCOME IS ABOUT $50,000

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:14.992
A YEAR AND THEY TRAVEL IN

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:18.595
EXCESS OF 100 MILES A DAY, AND

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:19.963
THEY DON'T DO IT BECAUSE

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.898
THEY'RE SIGHTSEEING, THEY'RE

00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:23.700
WORKING, THEY'RE PROVIDING

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:24.901
BENEFITS. THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:27.237
TO BUY GROCERIES. THEY HAVE TO

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:28.839
TRAVEL FOR BASICALLY EVERY

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:30.641
FUNCTION IN THEIR LIFE. AND A

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:33.944
STUDY RECENTLY INDICATED THAT

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:35.646
TRANSPORTATION COSTS ARE THE

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:37.781
BIGGEST PART OF A FAMILY BUDGET,

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:39.750
OUTSIDE OF THE RENT OR THE

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.718
MORTGAGE. IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:44.921
EVERYBODY, AND I'M LEARNING

00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:47.090
THAT LCFS HAS A BIG FUNCTION,

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:49.459
BUT I'M IN THE INSIDE, RIGHT?

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.995
I'M NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:52.829
I'M ACTUALLY PART OF THE

00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:54.564
LEGISLATURE. WE NEED TO

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:55.799
COMMUNICATE WITH OUR PUBLIC.

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:58.535
THE REAL BENEFIT THAT'S COMING.

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:01.004
AND DON'T JUST TELL ME THAT THE

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:02.439
ENVIRONMENT WINS. THAT DOESN'T

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:04.574
WORK. YOU NEED TO SHOW

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.109
SPECIFICALLY HOW THE

00:49:06.176 --> 00:49:09.413
ENVIRONMENT WINS, AND YOU'LL BE

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:11.415
MORE CONVINCING, AND MAYBE

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.650
YOU'LL HAVE MORE BUY IN. BUT I

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:14.651
LOOK FORWARD TO THIS, THIS

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:16.620
DISCUSSION SO THAT I CAN BE THE

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:18.689
MESSENGER AND HELP BE A FORCE

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:19.923
MULTIPLIER AND TELLING PEOPLE

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.726
THE IMPORTANCE OF LCFS, BECAUSE

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.528
I REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:28.598
PAY IT. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:32.703
THIS DISCUSSION. ASSEMBLY

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:35.405
MEMBER COLLINS I WILL KEEP MINE

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.075

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:46.383
OF CONVERSATION FOR US AS WELL,

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:47.684
THAT WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:48.952
BRINGING INTO OUR OUR

TIME FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

LEARN. I'VE LEARNED A LOT IN

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:01.465
THE LAST 48 HOURS. OKAY. BUT

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:02.799

HERE TO DIVE INTO THE PROGRAM

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:45.936
IN MORE DETAIL. IT IS AN

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:47.737
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX PROGRAM, AND

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:49.739
SO I KNOW YOU'LL APPRECIATE THE

00:51:52.075 --> 00:51:54.678
THOSE DETAILS. FIRST, I WANT TO

00:51:54.744 --> 00:51:56.680
BEGIN BY LAYING OUT THE

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:57.547
LANDSCAPE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:59.716
AS WE DO THIS WORK. AS CHAIR

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.852
WILSON MENTIONED, OUR CLEAN AIR

00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:04.254
EFFORTS ARE UNDER SIEGE BY A

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.755
HOSTILE ADMINISTRATION THAT IS

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:07.524
ACTIVELY WORKING TO SABOTAGE

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.793
THE STATE'S POLICIES FOR PUBLIC

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.394
HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL

00:52:11.461 --> 00:52:14.698
PROTECTION, AND TO ATTACK THE

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:16.833
STATE'S RIGHT TO PROTECT ITS

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.770
OWN CITIZENS. I AM SURE YOU'RE

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:23.707
ALREADY AWARE OF THE ATTACKS ON

00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:26.009
OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE VEHICLE

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:28.044
EMISSIONS THAT PROTECT

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:29.379
RESIDENTS, AND WE ARE

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:32.282
LITIGATING THOSE ISSUES RIGHT

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:35.986
NOW. BUT EVEN WORSE, OR JUST AS

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.487
WORSE, THE FEDERAL

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:40.156
ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO SOW

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:43.026
DOUBT AND TRUST IN SCIENCE AND

00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:44.761
DATA. THE CURRENT EFFORT TO

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:46.863
UNWIND THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.465
FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:52.135
ARE SUPPORTED BY A NEW STUDY

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:53.537
WITH FOSSIL FUEL ALIGNED

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:55.438
EXPERTS WHO ARE SUPPORTING WHO

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.941
ARE WHO ARE CHERRY PICKING TEXT

00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:00.143
AND IGNORING SOLID AND

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.646
REPEATEDLY VERIFIED DATA TO

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.648
UNDERMINE FAITH IN AMERICA'S

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:07.584
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:08.685
CONCLUSIONS THAT THOSE

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:12.589
SCIENTISTS HAVE REACHED. THEIR

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:13.857
DECISIONS PUT THE HEALTH OF

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:15.892
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AT

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:18.061
RISK. AND THIS DISRUPTION HAS

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:18.595
CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT OF

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:20.697
INVESTMENT, UNCERTAINTY THAT

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:23.533
PUTS OUR ECONOMY AT RISK. SO IT

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.136
IS MORE VITAL THAN EVER FOR US

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:28.138
TO MAINTAIN AND CONTINUE OUR

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:29.606
STATE EFFORTS TO FOSTER

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:31.708
INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION.

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.643
POLICIES, LIKE THE LOW CARBON

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.711
FUEL STANDARD WE'RE HERE TO

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:35.845
TALK ABOUT, AND OTHER

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:37.881
COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES LIKE THE

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:39.616
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:41.918
AND CAP AND TRADE TOGETHER,

00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:43.820
PROVIDE LONG TERM POLICY

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.422
CERTAINTY AND DIRECTION SO THAT

00:53:45.488 --> 00:53:46.690
THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:49.726
CAN WORK TOGETHER AND INVEST IN

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:51.628
A CLEANER FUTURE THAT CREATES

00:53:51.695 --> 00:53:53.430
THAT INNOVATION AND THOSE NEW

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:55.532
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, ALL

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:58.668
WHILE PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.470
SO, YOU KNOW, THE 20 YEAR

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:03.006
HISTORY BEHIND CALIFORNIA'S

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:05.942
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS AROUND

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.510
CLIMATE CHANGE, STARTING IN

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:10.914
2006 WITH AB 32. MORE RECENTLY,

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:12.549
THE LEGISLATURE'S CLIMATE GOAL

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:16.019
OF CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2045,

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:16.953
AND OUR MOST RECENT SCOPING

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.555
PLAN, CAUSING CALLING FOR

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:20.657
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:22.025
FOSSIL FUEL USE, WHICH HAVE

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:24.628
ATTENDANT HEALTH BENEFITS. THE

00:54:24.694 --> 00:54:26.496
EMISSIONS AND FUEL USE

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:28.198
REDUCTIONS IN THE SCOPING PLAN

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:30.066
PRIMARILY COME FROM ZERO

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:31.868
EMISSION CARS, TRUCKS, AND AND

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:35.472
CLEAN FUELS, BUT LCFS IS A KEY

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:38.074
PIECE OF THAT AS WELL. IT HAS

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:39.409
BEEN IN EFFECT FOR OVER A

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:41.778
DECADE, AND PLAYS AN EVEN MORE

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:44.214
CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING FUEL

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.715
LESS POLLUTING BY ENCOURAGING

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:48.118
INVESTMENT IN THE PRODUCTION OF

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:49.452
CLEANER FUEL ALTERNATIVES. AS

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:51.788
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUSTAINS

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:54.090
ITS ATTACK ON OUR EMISSIONS

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.592
STANDARDS, THE TRANSPORTATION

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:56.826
SECTOR REMAINS THE SINGLE

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:58.762
LARGEST SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:54:58.828 --> 00:55:00.930
MAN MADE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:02.499
EMISSIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR OVER

00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:04.567
50%. IF YOU INCLUDE UPSTREAM

00:55:04.634 --> 00:55:07.170
ACTIVITY, TRANSPORTATION IS

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:08.638
ALSO THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:10.407
SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS, WHICH

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.008
TRIGGER ASTHMA ATTACKS AND

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:14.644
HEART PROBLEMS. 60% OF THOSE

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:15.979
EMISSIONS COME FROM HEAVY DUTY

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:17.681
VEHICLES LIKE TRUCKS, BUSSES,

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:20.450
TRAINS, SHIPS AND PLANES, AND

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:21.685
HEAVILY IMPACT PEOPLE WHO LIVE

00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:26.923
ON THOSE CORRIDORS. THE US EPA

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.958
SETS HEALTH BASED AMBIENT AIR

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.593
QUALITY STANDARDS, AND DESPITE

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.730
ONGOING CHALLENGES, CALIFORNIA

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.832
HAS SEEN MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.500
OUR AIR QUALITY DUE TO THE

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:39.469
COLLECTIVE EFFORTS OF STATE AND

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:41.004
LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BUSINESSES

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:43.506
AND THE PUBLIC. SMOG FORMING

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:45.709
EMISSIONS HAVE DROPPED NEARLY

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.444
70% SINCE THE 1970S DUE TO

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.646
CALIFORNIA'S VEHICLE RULES,

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:51.381
WHICH HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED IN

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:54.184
MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.752
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS THAT

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:58.588
REDUCE VEHICLE EMISSIONS. STILL,

00:55:58.655 --> 00:55:59.823
MORE THAN 18 MILLION

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.491
CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN AREAS THAT

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:02.692
EXCEED FEDERAL OZONE STANDARDS

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:05.862
AND OVER 5000 PREMATURE DEATHS

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:07.997
OCCUR ANNUALLY AS A RESULT OF

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:09.432
EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION,

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.067
WHICH IS MOSTLY PRODUCED BY

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.269
MOBILE SOURCES. SO WITHOUT

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:15.071
PROGRAMS LIKE LCFS, WHICH HELP

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:16.673
US REDUCE AIR AND CLIMATE

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.542
POLLUTION, WE WOULD BE LOOKING

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:22.545
AT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:25.682
COSTLY INTERVENTIONS THAT MAY

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:28.985
NOT ACHIEVE THE INNOVATION AND

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:29.786
COST EFFECTIVENESS THAT THIS

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:32.522
PROGRAM FOSTERS. FAILING TO

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:34.624
MEET OUR CLIMATE AND AIR

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:35.792
QUALITY TARGETS MEANS FURTHER

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.560
HEALTH AND CLIMATE DAMAGE FOR

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:39.796
CALIFORNIANS, AND FRANKLY, ALSO

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:41.598
MEANS POTENTIAL FEDERAL

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.600
SANCTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.001
THE LOSS OF TRANSPORTATION

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:47.904
FUNDS. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.506
IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS, PUBLIC

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:51.574
INPUT FROM FORUM SPONSORED BY

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:53.843
STATE AGENCIES AROUND HOW DO WE

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.645
CONTINUE PROGRESS DESPITE

00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:57.814
FEDERAL ATTACKS ON OUR VEHICLE

00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:59.516
EMISSION STANDARDS. IN THOSE

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:01.684
PUBLIC FORUMS, SPEAKERS

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.486
REPEATEDLY NOTED THE VALUE OF

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:06.589
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IN

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:09.225
MAINTAINING MOMENTUM IN ZERO

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:11.394
EMISSION VEHICLES. IN THE FACE

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:13.830
OF THAT FEDERAL HOSTILITY. ALSO

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.598
RECOGNIZING THAT WE CONTINUE TO

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:19.669
NEED LIQUID FUELS, AND WE

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:20.837
CONTINUE, PARTICULARLY IN THE

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:23.540
HEAVY DUTY SECTOR, IT'S

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.809
CRITICAL THAT AS THE FEDERAL

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:28.378
ATTACKS ARE SLOWING DOWN,

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:30.480
IMPLEMENTATION OF ZERO EMISSION

00:57:30.547 --> 00:57:33.082
TRUCKS, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:34.417
THAT WE HAVE A CONTINUED,

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.886
RELIABLE SOURCE OF RENEWABLE

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:37.887
DIESEL TO PROVIDE THOSE

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:41.090
BENEFITS. BEFORE I HAND IT OVER

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.759
TO DIVISION CHIEF BATTELLE, I

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.694
JUST WANT TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:46.796
TO TALK ABOUT THE PRICE

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:48.765
CONCERNS, AND I REALLY

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.867
APPRECIATE THE FRAMING, BOTH BY

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:53.536
CHAIR WILSON AND CHAIR ALVAREZ

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:55.672
AND BY YOU AS WELL, MEMBER

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:57.774
LACKEY, THAT WE DO NEED TO TO

00:57:57.841 --> 00:57:58.608
REALLY THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:01.077
THE BENEFITS AND TALK ABOUT THE

00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:02.245
BENEFITS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:04.681
THOSE BENEFITS TO MUCH OF THE

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:06.182
CONVERSATION FOCUSES ON GAS

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:10.053
PRICES ALONE, AND WE KNOW THAT

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:13.223
THE MAIN INPUT FOR GAS PRICES

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:13.756
IS THE COST OF UNREFINED

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:15.992
PETROLEUM. THAT'S THE BIGGEST

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:19.062
CHUNK. AND THE FACT IS THAT GAS

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:19.762
PRICES ARE $0.07 LOWER THAN

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:21.798
THEY WERE A YEAR AGO, DESPITE

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:25.501
NEARLY 3% INFLATION. THE LCFS

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.070
AMENDMENTS CAME INTO EFFECT ON

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.439
JULY 1ST, AND DIRE PREDICTIONS

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.274
OF GAS PRICE HIKES DID NOT

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:34.477
OCCUR, AND WE RECOGNIZE, AS I

00:58:34.544 --> 00:58:36.846
NOTED EARLIER, THAT WE NEED TO

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:38.548
CONTINUE A STABLE AND FAIR

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:41.651
FUELS MARKET AS WE MAKE THIS

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:42.819
TRANSITION TO CLEANER AND

00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:44.754
CLEANER VEHICLES AND ALL THE

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:47.390
WAY TO ZERO. LCFS IS BRINGING

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:49.592
BILLIONS OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:52.195
ANNUALLY TO SUPPORT LOW CARBON

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:54.097
FUELS LIKE RENEWABLE DIESEL AND

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:56.766
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL, AND

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:59.068
ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES TO

00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:00.069
MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND. IN

00:59:00.136 --> 00:59:03.006
CALIFORNIA, INVESTMENTS THAT

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:04.707
CREATE JOBS, SPUR TECHNOLOGY

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:06.609
DEVELOPMENT AND HELP COMPANIES

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:08.611
GAIN A COMPETITIVE EDGE IN

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:12.949
CALIFORNIA, LOW CARBON FUEL

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.851
STANDARDS FUNDS, ZERO EMISSION

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:15.618
INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS, ZERO

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:17.820
EMISSION VEHICLES AND FUNDS THE

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:20.924
FUELS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.625
TO PROGRESS TO SEE THOSE HEALTH

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.727
AND CLIMATE BENEFITS. SO WITH

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:27.330
THAT, I WILL TURN OVER THE REST

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.232
OF CARB'S PRESENTATION TO MR.

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:31.901
BOTTLE. THANK YOU. CHAIR

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:33.937
RANDOLPH. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:35.772

STRATEGIES DIVISION AT THE

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.477
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD,

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:43.680
RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING,

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:44.447
ADMINISTERING AND OVERSEEING

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.015
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS.

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.984
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:50.119
HERE TODAY. I AM GOING TO DIVE

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:50.720
INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:52.689
ON SOME OF THE MECHANICS OF THE

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:54.757
PROGRAM, AND ADD SOME MORE

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:55.525
SPECIFICS TO THE POINTS THAT

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:58.027
THE CHAIR MADE. I'M GOING TO

00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:59.495
JUMP THROUGH THE THERE WE GO.

00:59:59.562 --> 01:00:01.698
I'M GOING TO JUMP THROUGH THESE

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:02.765
FIRST TWO SLIDES RELATIVELY

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.734
QUICKLY. THE CHAIR COVERED MUCH

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:05.902
OF THIS IN HER OPENING

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.738
STATEMENTS. AS YOU WELL KNOW,

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.773
WE HAVE A MANDATE HERE IN

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.841
CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:12.508
GAS EMISSIONS AND ACHIEVE

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:13.710
CARBON NEUTRALITY. AND WE NEED

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.378
TO CUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.413
TO GET TO THOSE STATUTORY

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.248
OBJECTIVES. AS CHAIR RANDOLPH

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:21.484
MENTIONED, WE ALSO HAVE

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:23.453
SIGNIFICANT EMISSIONS FROM THE

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.387
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. IT'S THE

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.688
SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:26.356
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:27.623
CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE PROGRAM

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.459
THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:30.426
TODAY, THE LOW CARBON FUEL

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:31.694
STANDARD, IS A KEY PROGRAM IN

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.997
HELPING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:34.464
GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.465
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:38.401
ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:38.901
LESS POLLUTING FUELS AND

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:43.706
VEHICLES. ALL RIGHT. SO THE

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:46.642
LCFS IS IS NOT A NEW REGULATION.

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:48.544
IN FACT, IT WAS FIRST ADOPTED

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:51.047
BY CARB IN 2009 AS AN EARLY

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:53.883
ACTION MEASURE UNDER AB 32. AND

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:54.717
CARB HAS AMENDED THE PROGRAM

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:57.353
MULTIPLE TIMES SINCE IT WAS

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.588
FIRST ADOPTED, EACH TIME

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:00.156
LOOKING TO IMPROVE AND

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.891
STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM FROM ITS

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.526
VERY INCEPTION, THE LCFS IS

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.694
DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COST

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:05.661
EFFECTIVE GHG REDUCTIONS FROM

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:08.631
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THE

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:09.832
LCFS DOESN'T MANDATE A SPECIFIC

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.968
FUEL OR OUTCOME. RATHER, IT

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:12.935
SETS A PERFORMANCE TARGET IN

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.470
THE FORM OF CARBON INTENSITY

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.505
REDUCTIONS, AND THEN CARB

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.206
OVERSEES A FLEXIBLE MARKET

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:18.841
WHERE PARTICIPATING ENTITIES

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:21.544
HAVE MANY COMPLIANCE OPTIONS

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.079
AND CAN FIND THE MOST

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.514
AFFORDABLE WAY TO ADVANCE CLEAN,

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.516
LOWER CARBON INTENSITY FUELS.

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.684
IN THIS WAY, THE LCFS IS

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:29.886
STRUCTURED TO CREATE AN

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.020
ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT LEAST

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.288
COST PATHWAY FOR DIVERSIFYING

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.623
THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:35.591
FUELS WITH LOWER CI FUELS,

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:36.893
RATHER THAN PURSUING MORE

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.728
DIRECT AND POTENTIALLY MORE

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:44.867
COSTLY MEASURES. THE PROGRAM

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.402
WORKS IN THIS WAY. WE CARVE

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:47.870
THROUGH REGULATIONS AT AN

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.205
ANNUAL ANNUAL DECLINE IN CARBON

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:50.239
INTENSITY TARGET FOR

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.474
TRANSPORTATION FUELS USED IN

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.509
CALIFORNIA, REPRESENTED BY THE

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:54.811
BLACK AND BLUE LINES. HERE ON

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.546
THIS SLIDE, THE LOWER CARBON

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:58.714
INTENSITY OF FUEL IS, THE MORE

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.249
CREDITS A FUEL PRODUCER CAN

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:01.517
GENERATE PER UNIT OF FUEL.

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.086
THESE CREDITS CAN THEN BE SOLD

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.554
IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR USED BY

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.923
THE FUEL PRODUCER FOR THEIR OWN

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.658
COMPLIANCE. PUT SIMPLY, THE

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:09.459
PROGRAM DESIGN REWARDS FUEL

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.561
PRODUCERS WHO PRODUCE LARGER

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:13.663
VOLUMES OF LOW CARBON FUELS.

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:15.531
HIGH CARBON FUELS SUCH AS

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:16.732
FOSSIL GASOLINE AND FOSSIL

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:18.401
DIESEL, HAVE CARBON INTENSITIES

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:20.136
THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE ANNUAL

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:21.804
CI TARGET. THESE HIGH CARBON

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:22.839
FUELS GENERATE WHAT WE CALL

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.640
DEFICITS, AND DEFICIT

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.242
GENERATING COMPANIES MUST

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:27.810
RETIRE CREDITS TO COMPLY WITH

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.745
THE ANNUAL TARGET. AS THE

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.080
CARBON INTENSITY TARGETS GET

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:32.448
LOWER EACH YEAR, CREDIT

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:33.716
GENERATING FUELS GENERATE FEWER

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.785
CREDITS BY VOLUME. SOME FUELS,

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:36.419
DEPENDING ON THEIR CARBON

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.854
INTENSITY SCORE, MAY EVENTUALLY

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.855
FLIP FROM BEING A CREDIT

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:40.289
GENERATOR TO A DEFICIT

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:41.691
GENERATOR. SO IN THIS WAY, THE

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:44.026
LCFS STRUCTURE CREATES A CLEAR

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:44.594
AND LONG TERM INCENTIVE TO

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.963
DEPLOY ONLY THE LOWEST CARBON

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.698
FUELS TO CALIFORNIA, AND TO

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:50.199
CONTINUALLY INNOVATE TO REDUCE

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.567
THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THE

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:54.804
EXISTING FUEL POOL. THE PROGRAM

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:55.638
HAS OUTPERFORMED PREVIOUS

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.673
CARBON INTENSITY TARGETS, AND

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.608
THAT'S SHOWN BY THE BLUE LINE.

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:00.543
BECAUSE OF RAPID GROWTH IN LOW

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.678
CARBON FUELS. THE GREEN LINE ON

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:03.579
THIS CHART SHOWS THE ACTUAL

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:05.548
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM,

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.782
WHERE THE OVERALL CARBON

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:07.617
INTENSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:09.752
TRANSPORTATION FUEL POOL HAS

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:10.953
BEEN WELL BELOW THE REGULATORY

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.456
TARGETS FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS.

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.891
THE GREEN LINE HERE REPRESENTS

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.659
A SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT.

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:17.860
IT MEANS THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:19.929
WERE ABLE TO SUPPLY LARGE

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.164
VOLUMES OF LOW CARBON FUELS TO

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.098
CALIFORNIA IN A COST EFFECTIVE

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.966
WAY, FAR EXCEEDING OUR REQUIRED

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:28.271
CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTIONS. AS

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:30.740
I MENTIONED EARLIER, EACH FUEL

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:31.607
HAS A CARBON INTENSITY BASED ON

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:33.876
ITS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS.

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:35.845
THIS SLIDE HAS AN ILLUSTRATION

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:36.746
OF THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:38.247
FOSSIL DIESEL, WHICH HAS A

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.483
CARBON INTENSITY OF AROUND 100.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.817
YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR LIFE CYCLE

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.786
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT UPSTREAM

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:44.887
EXTRACTION AND TRANSPORT OF THE

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:45.588
CRUDE OIL EMISSIONS, FROM

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.690
REFINING THE CRUDE INTO DIESEL,

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:48.558
TRANSPORT OF THE FINISHED

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:50.560
PRODUCT AND USE IN VEHICLES.

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:52.528
THIS FULL CHAIN IS REFERRED TO

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:55.932
AS THE FUEL PATHWAY. IN

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.733
COMPARISON, THIS SLIDE SHOWS A

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.768
HYPOTHETICAL CARBON INTENSITY

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.603
CALCULATION FOR RENEWABLE

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.138
DIESEL PRODUCED FROM USED

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.005
COOKING OIL. THE RENEWABLE

01:04:03.072 --> 01:04:04.707
DIESEL IN THIS EXAMPLE HAS A

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.542
MUCH LOWER CI VALUE, BECAUSE

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:08.678
THE FUEL IS PRODUCED FROM CROP

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:09.845
DERIVED WASTE OILS RATHER THAN

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.447
PETROLEUM, ITS OVERALL LIFE

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.549
CYCLE CARBON INTENSITY IS MUCH

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.117
LOWER THAN ITS FOSSIL FUEL

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:16.752
COUNTERPART, AND RENEWABLE

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:18.955
DIESEL CAN BE USED AS A DIRECT

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:24.760
REPLACEMENT FOR FOSSIL DIESEL.

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:27.029
SO THERE ARE OVER A THOUSAND

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:27.663
INDIVIDUAL FUEL PATHWAYS IN THE

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.432
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD, AND

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:30.766
CARB FOLLOWS A ROBUST PROCESS

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:31.968
FOR CALCULATING CARBON

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.603
INTENSITIES FOR EACH ONE BEFORE

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:34.704
CERTIFYING THESE FUEL PATHWAYS

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.406
FOR CREDITS FOR CARB TO CERTIFY

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:38.674
EACH PATHWAY, THE APPLICANT

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:39.809
MUST FIRST SUBMIT THEIR

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.143
OPERATIONAL DATA FOR EACH STEP

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.378
OF THE LIFECYCLE, INCLUDING

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:44.580
FEEDSTOCK PRODUCTION, TRANSPORT,

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.315
ENERGY USE TO RENDER OR REFINE

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:48.918
THE FEEDSTOCK, FUEL TRANSPORT,

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.586
AND FINALLY USE IN A VEHICLE.

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:51.854
CARBON INTENSITY VALUES ARE

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.589
THEN CALCULATED USING CARB

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:54.690
APPROVED LIFECYCLE ANALYSIS

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.425
TOOLS, AND THIRD PARTY

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:57.727
REVIEWERS REVIEW THE DATA AND

01:04:57.793 --> 01:05:00.496
CONDUCT ANNUAL AUDITS AND SITE

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:01.631
VISITS TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:02.765
OF THE OPERATIONAL DATA. CARB

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.834
STAFF ALSO REVIEW THE PATHWAY

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.469
FOR ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS.

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:09.305
THE MOST COMPLEX PATHWAYS ARE

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:10.072
ALSO POSTED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:12.675
PRIOR TO BEING CERTIFIED. THE

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.510
REGULATION REQUIRES CORRECTIONS

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:15.578
OR ADJUSTMENTS TO CARBON

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.713
INTENSITY VALUES. IF ERRORS ARE

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.116
IDENTIFIED IN ANY OF THESE

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:22.218
CHECKPOINTS, AND IN ADDITION TO

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:22.918
PATHWAY PROCESSING, OUR STAFF

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.720
ALSO OVERSEE THE VERIFIERS AND

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:28.124
CONDUCT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:35.998
AS NEEDED. SORRY. GO BACK ONE.

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:37.500
MORE FUEL TRANSACTIONS FROM

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:39.568
EACH QUARTER ARE REPORTED TO

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:40.536
CARB, AND AFTER THE QUARTERLY

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:41.871
REPORTING DEADLINE, CARB

01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:43.939
GENERATES CREDITS AND DEFICITS

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:46.809
FOR REPORTED FUEL VOLUMES BASED

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:49.845
ON THE CARBON INTENSITY. FOR

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.580
FUEL SUPPLIERS WITH A

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:52.682
COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION, THEY

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:53.582
MUST RETIRE THE QUANTITY OF

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:55.484
CREDITS MATCHING THEIR DEFICITS

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.786
BY APRIL 30TH OF EACH YEAR.

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:59.221
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUELS AND

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.056
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:00.890
COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:03.559
SHOWN ON THE SLIDE. AND TO

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.727
REINFORCE WHAT I MENTIONED

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.228
EARLIER, THE REGULATION

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:06.996
PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:08.698
COMPANIES TO COMPLY. A COMPANY

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:10.566
MAY GENERATE THEIR OWN CREDITS

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:11.967
TO MEET THEIR DEFICIT

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:12.568
OBLIGATION, AND THEY MAY ALSO

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:15.171
PROCURE CREDITS IN THE MARKET

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:17.473
TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATION. SLIDE

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.675
TEN SHOWS THE MANY WAYS IN

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:21.010
WHICH FUEL SUPPLIERS AND OTHERS

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:22.511
CAN GENERATE CREDITS UNDER THE

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.580
REGULATION. THE MOST COMMON

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:25.381
CREDIT GENERATION PATHWAYS COME

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.515
FROM LOW CARBON FUELS LIKE

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:27.650

REFINING EMISSIONS. MORE

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:45.101
RECENTLY, WE'VE ALSO UPDATED

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.936
THE REGULATION TO PROVIDE

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:47.670

SECONDARY LCFS CREDIT MARKET

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:11.394
HAS RESPONDED TO CARB'S

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.562
REGULATION. THE BLUE BAR

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:14.797
REPRESENTS INCREASING VOLUME OF

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.732
LCFS CREDIT TRANSACTIONS OVER

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:17.900
TIME, CONSISTENT WITH THE

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:18.634
GROWTH OF CREDITS BEING

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.370
GENERATED IN THE PROGRAM. THE

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:22.671
DASHED LINE SHOWS THE CHANGES

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:25.775
IN LCFS CREDIT PRICES OVER TIME.

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:26.642
MORE RECENTLY, LCFS CREDITS

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.644
HAVE BEEN TRADING UNDER $60 PER

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:29.879
CREDIT. THE CREDIT PRICES HAVE

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.514
COME DOWN FROM HIGHER PRICES

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.615
EARLIER THIS DECADE, WHICH

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:33.783
SHOWS THAT THE PROGRAM

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:34.583
STRUCTURE IS WORKING TO BRING

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.519
INCREASING VOLUMES OF LOW

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:38.354
CARBON FUELS FROM VARIOUS

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:39.455
PRODUCERS, AND THAT THIS

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.489
PRODUCTION COMPETITION IS

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.724
HELPING TO DRIVE MORE

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.125
AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVE FUELS

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.027
AND COST EFFECTIVE GREENHOUSE

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:49.732
GAS REDUCTIONS. SO I THINK THIS

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.634
GOES TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.502
MADE BY BOTH CHAIRS ON THE

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:54.670
BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM. I'M

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:55.905
GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME HERE

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:58.607
ON THIS SLIDE. IT SUMS UP SOME

01:07:58.674 --> 01:07:59.909
SOME OF THE KEY OUTCOMES FROM

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:01.710
THE REGULATION AND HOW IT'S

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:02.711
BEEN ONE OF OUR MOST EFFECTIVE

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:04.613
POLICY TOOLS TO SPEED UP THE

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.648
TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.450
FUELS WITHOUT RELYING ON ANY

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:10.085
PUBLIC SECTOR MONEY. THE

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.487
PROGRAM HAS GENERATED 3 TO $4

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:13.055
BILLION ANNUALLY IN PRIVATE

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:14.089

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:15.758
TRANSPORTATION, FUELS AND

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:18.594
OPTIONS. THAT PRIVATE SECTOR

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:19.762
INVESTMENT ULTIMATELY KEEPS

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:20.596
MONEY IN CALIFORNIA'S POCKETS

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.264
THROUGH INCREASING CONSUMER

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:23.232
CHOICES, WHICH DRIVE

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:24.133
TRANSPORTATION, FUEL

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.468
COMPETITION, GROWING NEW

01:08:25.534 --> 01:08:26.769
INDUSTRIES, AND ATTRACTING

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:27.870
INVESTMENTS THAT SUPPORT JOBS

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.472
AND STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:30.639
REDUCING DEPENDANCE ON

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.408
PETROLEUM AND THE OIL INDUSTRY.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:33.476
PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM ITS

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.544
ASSOCIATED SUPPLY AND COST

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:36.579
VOLATILITY. MAKING ELECTRIC

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.481
VEHICLES MORE AFFORDABLE.

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.049
EXPANDING ACCESS TO ELECTRIC

01:08:40.115 --> 01:08:41.116
VEHICLE CHARGING AND HYDROGEN

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:41.717
REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE, AND

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.486
REDUCING HEALTHCARE COSTS

01:08:43.552 --> 01:08:44.687
ASSOCIATED WITH AIR POLLUTION

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:46.622
FROM FOSSIL FUELS. UNDERNEATH

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.591
THESE STATS ON THE SLIDES ARE

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:49.859
STORIES OF HOW THE LCFS HAS

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:51.026
SPURRED INVESTMENT IN CLEAN

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:52.528
ENERGY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA,

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:52.995
WE'VE SEEN REFINERIES

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:53.863
TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUEL

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.364
PRODUCTION TO RENEWABLE FUEL

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:56.265
PRODUCTION. WE'VE SEEN

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.934
UTILITIES USE LCFS REVENUE TO

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.402
INVEST IN EV INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:01.604
SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES WITH

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.038
REBATES FOR ZERO EMISSION

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.807
VEHICLES. DAIRIES ARE USING THE

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:05.574
PROGRAM INCENTIVES THAT THEY

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:07.643
RECEIVE THROUGH THIS POLICY TO

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.211
CAPTURE METHANE AND TO EVEN

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:09.979
PRODUCE HYDROGEN AND

01:09:10.045 --> 01:09:11.514
ELECTRICITY THAT THEY THEN

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.350
SUPPLY TO TRANSIT AGENCIES FOR

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.585
ON FARM OPERATIONS. EV CHARGING

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:17.753
COMPANIES ARE UTILIZING THE

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.255
LCFS TO BUILD MORE FAST

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:20.656
CHARGERS. TRANSIT AGENCIES USE

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:22.324
LCFS REVENUE TO SUPPORT ONGOING

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:23.492
OPERATIONS OF ZERO EMISSION

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:25.628
BUSSES, AND ELECTRIFIED RAIL

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.263
AND TRUCKING COMPANIES RECEIVE

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:28.531
UPWARDS OF $1,000 A MONTH IN

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:29.698
LCFS REVENUE PER BATTERY

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:30.966
ELECTRIC TRUCK. TO HELP CLOSE

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:32.535
THE GAP BETWEEN DIESEL AND

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:35.404
BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCK VEHICLE

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:44.713
COSTS. IN 2006, WHEN AB 32

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.048
BECAME LAW, THE STATE USED

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:47.650
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOSSIL FUELS.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.552
SINCE THAT TIME, AND THANKS IN

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.554
LARGE PART TO THE LCFS,

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.222
CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:53.822
ALTERNATIVE FUEL VOLUMES FROM

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:56.091
5% OF THE TOTAL FUEL POOL TO

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:59.662
27% IN 2024. ONE CRITICISM WE

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:01.630
HEAR ABOUT THE PROGRAM IS THAT

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.399
IT IS SHIFTING BENEFITS OUT OF

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:04.667
CALIFORNIA. IN REALITY, THE

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:05.768
REGULATION BRINGS SIGNIFICANT

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:07.870
VOLUMES OF LOW CARBON FUELS

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:08.637
DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.639
CONSUMERS. AND WHILE IT'S TRUE

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:11.941
THAT SOME OF THESE FUELS ARE

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.576
PRODUCED IN FACILITIES LOCATED

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:14.743
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA, THIS IS

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.179
NO DIFFERENT THAN HOW THE

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:17.780
FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY EXTRACTS

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:18.614
AND TRANSPORTS CRUDE AND

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:19.848
FINISHED FUEL FROM OUT OF STATE

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:21.617
TO CALIFORNIA, OR HOW FOSSIL

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:22.751
NATURAL GAS IS SUPPLIED FROM

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.653
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA INTO THE

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.021
STATE, OR HOW ELECTRICITY IS

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:26.722
TRANSMITTED ACROSS STATE

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.924
BORDERS TO MEET CALIFORNIA

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:30.526
DEMAND. THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:33.395
THE LOW CARBON FUEL MARKET IS

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:34.496
NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:37.700
ENERGY MARKET. IF WE LOOK

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.034
CLOSELY AT ZEV INFRASTRUCTURE,

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:40.736
YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE THAT

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:41.870
LCFS HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:42.871
SUPPORT FOR ZERO EMISSION

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:44.139
VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE HERE IN

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:46.609
CALIFORNIA. AS OF AUGUST 2025,

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.911
THERE HAVE BEEN A TOTAL OF 79

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.746
HYDROGEN STATIONS AND 969 FAST

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:52.481
EV CHARGER SITES APPROVED TO

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:54.717
RECEIVE ADDITIONAL LCFS CREDITS.

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.952
THIS NUMBER IS GROWING EVERY

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:58.754
DAY. EACH OF THESE SITES THAT

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:01.090
YOU SEE ON THIS SLIDE HAVE

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:02.625
MULTIPLE CHARGERS OR HYDROGEN

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.560
DISPENSING NOVELS. SO THE

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.929
REALITY IS THAT THE THE ACTUAL

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:08.597
EV CHARGERS NUMBER IN THE

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:14.737
THOUSANDS. GIVEN THIS TRACK

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:15.971
RECORD OF SUCCESS AND

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:17.573
CALIFORNIA'S STATUTORY MANDATE

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.907
TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.509
2045, CARB STAFF INITIATED

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.578

THE 2022 SCOPING PLAN APPROVAL.

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.582
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH ON THE

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:27.850
RIGHT SIDE, YOU'LL SEE THE

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.785
GREEN DOTTED LINE, WHICH SHOWS

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.286
THE 20% REDUCTION IN CARBON

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:31.854
INTENSITY BY 2030, WHICH WAS

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.022
REQUIRED BY THE PREVIOUS

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:35.758
REGULATION. IT ALSO SHOWS THAT

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:36.692
THAT LEVEL OF CARBON INTENSITY

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.594
REDUCTION REMAINS AT 20% UNTIL

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:41.096

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:45.934
SHOWS THE NEW CARBON INTENSITY

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:46.568
REDUCTION LEVELS THAT ARE PART

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.637
OF THE UPDATED REGULATION.

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:49.905
THESE NEW TARGETS, AS WELL AS

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.807
OTHER UPDATES WE MADE TO THE

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:52.708

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:02.151
HELP ACHIEVE THE STATE'S CARBON

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.019
NEUTRALITY OBJECTIVES. THE

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:05.454
EXPECTED INVESTMENTS WILL ALSO

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:06.689
RESULT IN IMPORTANT AIR QUALITY

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:07.923

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:09.885
CHANGE UNDER SUCCESSFUL

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:11.186
IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR LCFS AND

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:12.755
OUR COMPLEMENTARY ZEV POLICIES,

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:15.324
WE KNOW THE FUTURE WON'T MATCH

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:16.391
THESE OUTCOMES EXACTLY, BUT WE

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:17.693
ANTICIPATE IS THAT WE WILL

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.128
CONTINUE TO SEE A MAJOR

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:20.763
TRANSITION TO ELECTRICITY AND

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:21.396
HYDROGEN USE IN THE

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:22.664
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, WITH A

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:25.467
SMALLER BUT PERSISTENT ROLE FOR

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:26.702
LIQUID FUELS USED IN COMBUSTION

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:29.838
ENGINES. WHAT YOU MAY ALSO

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:31.507
NOTICE IS THAT THE BAR CHART ON

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:32.708
THE RIGHT IS SMALLER THAN THE

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.409
ONE ON THE LEFT. SIMPLY PUT,

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:35.711
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE MORE

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:36.912
ENERGY EFFICIENT THAN

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.680
COMBUSTION VEHICLES. SO IF

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:39.381
WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN DEPLOYING

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:41.550
MORE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:42.885
2045, WE WILL ALSO ULTIMATELY

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:44.386
REQUIRE LESS OVERALL ENERGY.

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:47.689
EVEN WITH A GROWING ECONOMY AND

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.558
POPULATION. THESE TWO THINGS A

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:50.926
SHIFT TO ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:51.960
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES,

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:52.661
REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:53.695
OPPORTUNITY FOR CLEAN

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.798
TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT. BASED ON

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.466
A RULEMAKING ANALYSIS, CARB

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:59.601
STAFF ESTIMATED THAT THE LCFS

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.436
UPDATES COULD RESULT IN OVER

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:01.970
100 BILLION IN CUMULATIVE

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.272
PRIVATE INVESTMENT

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:06.508
OPPORTUNITIES BY 2045. WE

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:07.676
AREN'T ALONE IN SEEING THE

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:08.877
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THESE CLEAN

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.412
FUELS MARKETS CREATE. FOR A

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:11.580
NUMBER OF YEARS NOW, THE

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:12.648
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.316
SUPPORT FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:15.751
VIA THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD.

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:16.652
FUEL PRODUCERS BRING CLEAN

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:18.654
FUELS TO CALIFORNIA, LEVERAGE

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.421
INCENTIVES FROM THIS

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:20.522
COMPLEMENTARY FEDERAL POLICY,

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.057
AS WELL AS WELL AS OTHER TAX

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.458
CREDITS AND INCENTIVES. OTHER

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.594
COUNTRIES AND STATES HAVE ALSO

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:26.895
ADOPTED OR CONSIDERING LCFS

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.363
PROGRAMS OF THEIR OWN. THERE

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.598
ARE CURRENTLY FOUR OTHER STATES

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:30.599
THAT ESTABLISHED OR ARE

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:31.733
DEVELOPING LOW CARBON FUEL

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.734
MARKETS, FOLLOWING CARR'S

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:33.936
EXAMPLE, AND EIGHT MORE STATES

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:34.703
THAT HAVE PROPOSED LEGISLATION

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.772
TO CREATE SUCH MARKETS. THIS

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.040
SPEAKS TO BOTH THE SUCCESS OF

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:39.474
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:40.776
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:42.344
CREATING LONG, STABLE, LONG

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:43.478
TERM POLICIES THAT CREATE A

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:46.348
CLEAR AND REPLICABLE PATH FOR

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:46.949
TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM FOSSIL

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:51.086
FUELS AND TOWARDS ALTERNATIVES.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.922
SO THE CHAIR TALKED A LITTLE

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.557
BIT ABOUT THIS IN HER REMARKS,

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.893
BUT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:58.727
TO WALK THROUGH THE COST

01:14:58.794 --> 01:14:59.862
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:00.729
REGARDING THE LCFS COMMISSIONER

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.631
WILL ALSO SPEAK TO THIS AS WELL,

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:03.966
BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.500
THE LCFS CREDIT PRICES ARE NOT

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:07.402
A MAJOR DRIVER OF RETAIL FUEL

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:08.737
PRICES IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.505
CAN SEE FROM THIS CHART, AS

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:11.740
CREDIT PRICES AND THE RETAIL

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.108
PRICE OF GASOLINE IN CALIFORNIA

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.476
DO NOT TRACK TOGETHER IN ANY

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:16.645
MEANINGFUL WAY, WE KNOW THAT

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:17.746
CLIMATE ACTION WILL COME WITH

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.548
SOME COSTS AND STATUTORY

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:20.649
MANDATES. DIRECT CARB TO

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:22.384
DEVELOP COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS.

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:24.820
THE LCFS DOES THIS. INSTEAD OF

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:25.721
DIRECT REGULATIONS ON FUEL

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:28.023
PROVIDERS, THE LCFS PROVIDES

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.558
COMPLEMENTARY COMPLIANCE

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:30.759
FLEXIBILITY THAT COMPANIES CAN

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.794
ADAPT TO THEIR OWN NEEDS AND

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.796
KEEP COMPLIANCE COSTS LOW. SO

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:36.899
I'M GOING TO PAUSE FOR A SECOND.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:37.699
I APPRECIATED CHAIR WILSON,

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:39.801
YOUR ANALOGY ON COFFEE. I'M A

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.570
COFFEE DRINKER. IN FACT, I FEEL

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:43.672
LIKE IT IS NECESSARY FOR MY

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.374
LIFE. I HAVE TO HAVE IT EVERY

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.876
DAY, BUT I'M ALSO SOMEBODY THAT

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.044
IS VERY FOCUSED ON COST

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:50.579
EFFECTIVENESS. SO I ALWAYS GO

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.648
FOR THE HOMEMADE DRIP COFFEE,

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.815
THE CHEAPEST COFFEE THAT GETS

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:54.716
ME THE MOST CAFFEINE FOR THE

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:56.718
BUCK THAT I CAN POSSIBLY GET. I

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.887
REALLY ALSO PHÐ SIMILAR. IT'S A

01:15:58.954 --> 01:16:01.523
POLICY THAT IS GETTING US THE

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.425
MOST COST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:04.593
THAT CAFFEINE AS POSSIBLE. IT'S

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.695
THE DRIP COFFEE IN YOUR KITCHEN.

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:07.529
YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE MORE

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:09.097
EXPENSIVE POLICY OPTIONS THAT

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:09.932
HAVE MORE FRILLS ASSOCIATED

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:10.933
WITH THEM, BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.501
GOING TO GET YOU THAT DIRECT

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:13.502
INJECTION OF CAFFEINE FOR AS

01:16:13.568 --> 01:16:20.709
LOW COST AS POSSIBLE. IN

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:21.643
REALITY. SO I'M GOING TO SKIP

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.845
TO THE NEXT SLIDE. RETAIL FUEL

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:25.013
PRICING THAT CONSUMERS PAY AT

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.515
THE PUMP ARE AFFECTED BY MANY

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:27.582
DIFFERENT VARIABLES. STATE

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:30.052
AGENCIES HAVE EXAMINED DATA ON

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:31.019
RETAIL GASOLINE BETWEEN 2019

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:33.088
AND 2023, AND THE COST OF CRUDE

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:33.889
OIL DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.490
COSTS AND THE MARKET BEHAVIOR.

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:37.059
PETROLEUM REFINERIES INFLUENCES

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:39.127
OVER 80% OF THE RETAIL GASOLINE

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:41.563
PRICE PAID BY CONSUMERS. IT'S

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:42.831
ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.433
ENVIRONMENTAL FEES AND TAXES

01:16:44.499 --> 01:16:46.568
PAID BY CONSUMERS YIELD DIRECT

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:47.736
BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA IN THE

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.538
FORM OF IMPROVED AIR QUALITY,

01:16:49.604 --> 01:16:51.707
SAFER ROADS, HIGHWAYS, AS WELL

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:52.808
AS INNOVATION UNDER THE LCFS

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:55.978
AND INVESTMENT IN CLEAN TECH.

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.546
WHILE HIGHER CARBON INTENSITY

01:16:57.612 --> 01:16:59.581
FUEL PRODUCING ENTITIES CAN

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:00.849
SHIFT THE COST OF COMPLIANCE

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:01.984
WITH THE LCFS TO CONSUMERS,

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.719
THEY DO NOT HAVE TO FUEL,

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.187
PRODUCERS HAVE DIFFERENT

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:06.021
STRATEGIES FOR COMPLYING. SOME

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:07.556
MIGHT PRODUCE CLEANER, LOWER

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:09.391
CARBON INTENSIVE FUELS

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:09.891
THEMSELVES, POTENTIALLY

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:11.126
BENEFITING FROM THE INCENTIVES.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:12.594
OTHERS MAY BUY CREDITS AT

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:14.096
CURRENT MARKET PRICES OR VIA

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:15.397
FORWARD CONTRACTS. THESE

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.099
DYNAMICS AND CHOICES FROM

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.667
ENTITIES PARTICIPATING IN THE

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:19.568
PROGRAM MAKE IT EXCEEDINGLY

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:21.503
DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, WITH ANY

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:22.738
CONFIDENCE WHETHER HIGH CARBON

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:23.872
INTENSIVE, FUEL PRODUCING

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:24.573
ENTITIES WILL PASS THOSE COSTS

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:27.676
ON TO CONSUMERS OR ABSORB THEM,

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:28.777
MAKING IT CHALLENGING TO

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:29.711
ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE EXACT

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.780
IMPACT ON RETAIL GASOLINE

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:34.483
PRICES PAID BY CONSUMERS.

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:37.452
ALMOST DONE. AS FOR THE

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:38.587
AMENDMENTS, THE UPDATED

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:40.589
REGULATION WENT INTO EFFECT IN

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:41.990
JULY 2025, DESPITE CLAIMS OF

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:43.492
SIGNIFICANT AND DRAMATIC GAS

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.693
PRICE SPIKES FROM THE

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.495
AMENDMENTS, REPORTED DATA SHOWS.

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:47.562
THE IMPACT OF THE AMENDMENTS IS

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:49.698
APPROXIMATELY $0.07 PER GALLON,

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:50.866
AND WHEN COMPARING THE FULL

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.601
RETAIL PRICE PAID AT THE PUMP

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.636
OVER TIME, RETAIL GAS PRICES,

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:55.737
AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED, WERE

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:56.671
ACTUALLY LOWER IN JULY 2025

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.640
THAN THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR.

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.709
OVER THE COURSE OF ALMOST TWO

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:01.476
DECADES OF IMPLEMENTING CLIMATE

01:18:01.543 --> 01:18:02.778
AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, WE

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.346
HAVE SEEN TIME AND AGAIN

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.081
DRAMATIC CLAIMS OF RETAIL GAS

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:08.183
PRICE IMPACTS BY OPPONENTS OF

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.251
THESE POLICIES OR STAKEHOLDERS

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:10.786
WHO ARE ULTIMATELY UNHAPPY

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:12.187
ABOUT SPECIFIC REGULATORY

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.456
REQUIREMENTS OR POLICY CHOICES.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:15.724
OUR BOARD IS COMMITTED TO

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:16.892
MITIGATING ADVERSE CONSUMER

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.627
IMPACTS IF THEY SHOULD OCCUR

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:19.494
FROM OUR POLICIES, BUT IT'S

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:20.762
IMPORTANT THAT ANY ASSESSMENTS

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.831
RELY ON DATA AND FACTS INSTEAD

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.533
OF RHETORIC. AND SO WE'VE BEEN

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:25.634
DIRECTED BY THE BOARD TO

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.802
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:27.836
PARTNERS AT THE ENERGY

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:30.172
COMMISSION TO BRING DATA AND

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:31.173
FACTS INTO THE LCFS

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.474
CONVERSATION. I WANTED TO END

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.709
MY SLIDE PRESENTATION ON A MORE

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:35.811
POSITIVE NOTE. SO ONE LAST

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.479
SLIDE ON TRANSPORTATION COSTS.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.880
OVERALL, WE EXPECT THE AMOUNT

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:40.715
OF MONEY CALIFORNIANS SPEND ON

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:41.550
TRANSPORTATION FUELS WILL

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:43.585
ACTUALLY DECLINE OVER TIME AS

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:45.020
WE SHIFT TO ALTERNATIVE FUELS

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:46.555
AND MORE EFFICIENT ZERO

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:47.689
EMISSION VEHICLES. THE AMOUNT

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:50.058
OF MONEY THE AVERAGE DRIVER

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:50.625
SPENDS ON A PER MILE BASIS

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:52.627
COULD BE CUT IN HALF. AND AS

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:53.929
THE LCFS AND CALIFORNIA

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:55.530
CONTINUE TO LEAD IN THIS SPACE,

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:58.033
WE'LL SEE A FUEL MARKET WITH A

01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:58.834
GREATER NUMBER OF CLEAN FUEL

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.001
PRODUCERS, ALLOWING FOR GREATER

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.937
COMPETITION AND LOWER FUEL

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:02.771
RATES WHEN COMPARED TO THE

01:19:02.838 --> 01:19:03.638
SMALLER AND MORE CONCENTRATED

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:04.773
NUMBER OF PETROLEUM FUEL

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.675
PRODUCERS WE HAVE TODAY. WE

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:07.776
EXPECT THIS COMPETITION WILL

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:08.777
ALSO HELP PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.645
ON OVERALL FUEL PRICES AND WILL

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.314
FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT OF

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:12.881
ONGOING INNOVATION IN CLEAN

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.549
FUEL PRODUCTION THAT BRINGS

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:16.685
AFFORDABILITY, CLIMATE AND AIR

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:17.119
QUALITY BENEFITS TO

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.753
CALIFORNIANS. AND SO WITH THAT,

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.555
I'M GOING TO HAND IT OFF TO

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:21.623
VICE CHAIR OF THE ENERGY

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.159
COMMISSION FOR HIS REMARKS. I

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.227
APPRECIATE THE TIME TODAY. I

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:26.294
LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUESTIONS.

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:28.830
THANK YOU. MATT. GOOD AFTERNOON,

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.966
CHAIR WILSON, CHAIR ALVAREZ AND

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:31.800
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:33.702
YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:35.403
HERE. I HAVE JUST THREE SLIDES

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.006
TO GO THROUGH REAL QUICKLY. SO

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:41.543
THE CDC HAS DIFFERENT PATHS TO

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.111
COLLECT INFORMATION ON THE COST

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:45.814
OF LCFS AS A PART OF THE GALLON

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.649
OF GASOLINE SOLD, THANKS TO THE

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:51.753
LEGISLATURE, SB 1322 ALLEN BILL

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.522
KIND OF GIVES US THE DATA

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:56.091
CALLED THE 1322 DATA, WHICH IS

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.926
POSTED IN AGGREGATE ON OUR

01:19:57.993 --> 01:20:00.395
WEBSITE. SIMILARLY, WE ALSO

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.397
HAVE A SECOND PATH, WHICH IS A

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:03.899
INDUSTRY SUBSCRIPTION CALLED

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:04.766
THE OPUS, WHICH SUBSCRIBE TO

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.868
THAT DATA. AND AND WE GATHER

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.904
THAT INFORMATION AS WELL. SINCE

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.772
WE STARTED COLLECTING THE 1322

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.541
INFORMATION FROM THE REFINERIES

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:14.709
DIRECTLY FROM THE INDUSTRY, AND

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:15.610
KIND OF COMPARE THAT THE OPUS

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:18.013
DATA, THEY BOTH TRACK REALLY

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:18.847
WELL. SO THE INFORMATION WE

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:21.116
HAVE FROM BOTH PARTIES SEEMS TO

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:22.617
BE CONSISTENT. AND THE

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:24.686
INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT IS

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.922
CONFIDENTIAL, BUT WE DO POST

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:27.622
AGGREGATED INFORMATION ON OUR

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:29.024
WEBSITE AND IS AVAILABLE AND

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.660
HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY FURTHER

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:33.061
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE

01:20:33.128 --> 01:20:34.429
ON THE DATA STREAM ITSELF.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.665
GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE, JUST

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:38.533
WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.702
THE THERE WERE TWO QUESTIONS

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:43.071
THAT CÁC GOT OVER THE LAST

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.540
COUPLE OF YEARS IN TERMS OF THE

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:46.374
CONTRIBUTION OF CLIMATE

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:48.643
PROGRAMS, TAX AND FEES TO A

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:49.778
GALLON OF GASOLINE IN

01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:51.246
CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:52.447
REPEATEDLY SAID THAT

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.616
INFORMATION, WHICH IS IT IS A

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:56.084
FACT, AND I DON'T THINK WE

01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:57.552
SHOULD EVER REFUTE THAT, THAT

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.988
THERE IS A COST THAT THAT IS

01:21:00.055 --> 01:21:00.722
ADDED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.891
PROGRAMS, YOU KNOW, FOR THE

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.426
PRICE OF GALLON IN CALIFORNIA.

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.595
BUT I THINK THE QUESTION, AS

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:07.829
CHAD WILSON YOU MENTIONED, IS

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.531
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS AND HOW

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:11.733
DO WE COMPARE THE PROS AND CONS

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.702
AND THE BENEFITS OF THAT? SO I

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:14.836
WANTED TO JUST GIVE YOU A

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:17.172
LITTLE BIT OF A HIGH LEVEL

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:17.739
BREAKDOWN OF THE COMPONENTS

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:19.241
THAT YOU SEE HERE. AS CHAIR

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:20.642
RANDOLPH MENTIONED, ONE OF THE

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:23.178
BIGGEST COMPONENTS OF PRICE TO

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:25.647
PRICE OF GALLON AT THE PUMP IS

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.716
THE CRUDE OIL COST. SO WHAT WE

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:29.551
HAVE IN THERE IS THE PERCENT

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:30.752
BREAKDOWN OF EACH OF THOSE

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:33.088
COMPONENTS. AND AS YOU SEE

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.624
THERE, AND AS YOU GO FROM A

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:37.225
GALLON OF PETROLEUM THAT'S

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:38.560
COMING INTO A REFINERY, SO

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:39.861
THERE'S A CRUDE OIL ACQUISITION

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:41.863
COST GOES THROUGH THE REFINERY,

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:44.032
AND YOU HAVE THE COST ADDED IN

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:44.833
TERMS OF REFINERY MARGIN THAT

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:46.968
ACCOUNTS FOR THAT PROFITS, BUT

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:47.535
ALSO OPERATIONAL COSTS. AND

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:50.138
THEN IT STARTS GOING DOWN THE

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.539
LANE ALL THE WAY TO THE PUMP.

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:53.708
SO ONE OF THE TAKEAWAYS FROM

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:55.710
THIS IS, YOU KNOW, AT A AT A

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.646
VERY HIGH LEVEL, THE CRUDE OIL

01:21:57.712 --> 01:21:58.713
HAS THE BIGGEST COMPONENT AND

01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.681
THE COMPONENT FROM THE PROGRAMS.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:02.384
WHILE THEY EXIST, THEY'RE

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:03.685
RELATIVELY SMALLER TO THE

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.520
OVERALL PRICE OF THE GALLON.

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.756
GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE, THE

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:09.924
OTHER QUESTION THAT WE GOT, YOU

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.693
KNOW, ESPECIALLY THE ENERGY

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.527
COMMISSION OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.863
OF YEARS, IS DO THE

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:15.630
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:16.931
CONTRIBUTE TO THE PRICE SPIKES

01:22:16.998 --> 01:22:18.600
THAT WE ARE TRYING TO TACKLE IN

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:19.801
CALIFORNIA? AND THE ANSWER IS

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.569
VERY CLEAR WITH THE DATA WE

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.738
HAVE, WHILE THEY ARE PERSISTENT

01:22:23.805 --> 01:22:26.308
AND THEY EXIST, THEY DO NOT

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:28.610
CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL PRICE

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:29.878
VOLATILITY. AGAIN, LOOKING AT

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.479
THE SLIDE HERE, YOU KNOW,

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.048
STACKING ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:34.716
COMPONENTS OVER TIME. WHAT YOU

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:35.550
SEE THERE IS THE CRUDE OIL

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:38.653
PRICES DO VARY A LOT TO JUST

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.522
GIVE YOU A MEASURE OF THAT. IF

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.691
THE CRUDE OIL MOVES ABOUT $0.10

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:46.594
OR, SORRY, $10 A BARREL

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:47.662
INTERNATIONALLY BECAUSE IT'S

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:50.098
ALL INTERNATIONALLY INDEXED,

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:50.665
YOU'RE MOVING ABOUT $0.25 A

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.734
GALLON, AND THAT GETS

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:53.335
TRANSITIONED VERY QUICKLY INTO

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.770
THE PRICE OF THE GALLON. SECOND,

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.472
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:22:57.539 --> 01:22:58.606
ESTABLISHED OVER THE LAST

01:22:58.673 --> 01:22:59.741
COUPLE OF YEARS, AND AGAIN,

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.576
THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.812
THESE DISCUSSIONS, AS WE HAVE

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:06.081
THE SUPPLY VARY IN CALIFORNIA

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.550
OF REFINED FUEL THAT DOES

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:09.751
IMPACT THE REFINERY AND THE

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.486
INDUSTRY MARGINS OVERALL. AND

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:13.121
THOSE ARE THE TWO COMPONENTS

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:15.457
THAT REALLY DO MOVE IN TERMS OF,

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:17.692
YOU KNOW, THE VOLATILITY OF THE

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:20.462
GALLON OF GASOLINE. BUT AS YOU

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:21.696
LOOK AT THE REST OF IT, YOU

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:23.832
KNOW, WHETHER THE STATE TAXES,

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:24.966
FEDERAL EXCISE TAX, STATE

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:26.701
EXCISE TAX, AND THEN YOU HAVE

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:27.769
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS,

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.705
THEY DO STAY PRETTY, PRETTY

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.474
SOLID WITHOUT MOVING MUCH. SO

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.843
THOSE ARE ALL THE SLIDES I HAVE

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.444
HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:37.712
AS WE COME UP. AND THANK YOU

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:40.582
FOR HAVING ME HERE. THANK YOU.

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:42.384
SO THIS CONCLUDES THE

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:43.651
PRESENTATIONS OF THE FIRST

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:46.087
PANEL. AND SO NOW I'M OPENING

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:49.958
IT UP FOR MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS.

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:52.694
CO-CHAIR. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:55.964
CHAIR. THANK YOU ALL FOR THE

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:58.533
PRESENTATION. I HAVE A FEW

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.136
QUESTIONS. I'M GOING TO TRY TO

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.972
DO IT BASED ON THE SLIDESHOW,

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:05.440
TO TRY TO GET EVERYBODY AN

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:06.808
OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:11.179
I'M ASKING. SOMETIMES I DON'T

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:12.680
COMMUNICATE THE QUESTIONS AS

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:15.750
CLEARLY. SO LET'S IF WE COULD

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.086
GO TO SLIDE NUMBER FIVE FROM

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:20.088
CARB'S PRESENTATION, I WOULD

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:23.425
APPRECIATE THAT. SO THIS THIS

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.960
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET IT ON

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.395
THE SCREEN TO HELP MEMBERS AND

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:29.731
THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SO

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:31.766
WE CAN GO BACK TO FIVE. THAT

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.935
WOULD BE GREAT. AND AS WE GO TO

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:36.070
TO THAT SLIDE, I'D ASK THE

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:37.572
QUESTION, SO YOU HAVE THIS

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:39.741
GRAPH WITH THE BLACK LINE WHICH

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:42.577
WAS THE COMPLIANCE CURVE, THE

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:43.711
ANTICIPATED, IF YOU WILL,

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:47.882
CARBON INTENSITY AND THE GREEN

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.717
LINE WHICH IS THE ACTUAL CARBON

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:50.518
INTENSITY REDUCTION THAT WE

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.687
HAVE SEEN OUT IN THE REAL WORLD.

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:55.757
THERE IS A DELTA THERE, A GAP

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:59.093
THAT'S QUITE SIGNIFICANT, WHICH

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.763
PLEASE CORRECT ME HERE IF MY

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.064
WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING AND

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:04.966
TAKING FROM THIS, THE ADOPTION

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:08.536
HAS BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.705
ANTICIPATED, AND THAT COULD BE

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:11.739
FOR A VARIETY OF FACTORS. I

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:12.707
CERTAINLY WOULD BE INTERESTED

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.609
IN HEARING FROM YOU WHY WHY

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:17.812
THAT HAS OCCURRED. AND GIVEN

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:20.215
THAT THIS HAS CIRCLED AROUND

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:21.816
THE ISSUE OF COST, HOW DO YOU

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:24.052
HOW COULD SOMEONE OR WHAT CAN

01:25:24.118 --> 01:25:27.188
SOMEONE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:30.225
MORE RAPID ADOPTION TRANSLATED

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:32.594
INTO ACTUAL COSTS, POTENTIALLY.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.462
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW YOU ENDED

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:37.165
THIS SERIES OF PRESENTATIONS IN

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.099
THIS PANEL, YOU KNOW,

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:38.867
IDENTIFYING WHAT THE COST

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:40.668
REALLY IS, AND IT'S QUITE CLEAR

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:43.671
THAT IT'S NOT CONTRIBUTING MUCH.

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:45.573
BUT BUT THERE IS A COST. SO I'M

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.375
JUST CURIOUS EITHER THE COST OF

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:50.845
THAT AND THEN HAS THAT BEEN

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:51.579
MEASURED AGAINST POTENTIAL

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:53.548
ECONOMIC BENEFITS. BECAUSE MOST

01:25:53.615 --> 01:25:56.651
OF THIS IS ALL INNOVATION

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:57.519
THAT'S HAPPENING IN A LOT OF

01:25:57.585 --> 01:25:59.654
SPACES. AND YOU LIST THAT ALL

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:00.855
THE EXAMPLES OF THOSE, SOME OF

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.757
THE EXAMPLES OF THAT INNOVATION

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.627
WITH NEW TYPES OF FUELS. HAS

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:07.061
ANYBODY DONE AN ASSESSMENT ON

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:09.964
WHAT ECONOMIC BENEFITS, PERHAPS

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:10.832
THROUGH INNOVATION, JOB

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.634
CREATION, ANY OF THOSE THINGS?

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.669
WHAT HAS THAT BROUGHT TO THE

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:15.904
TABLE SO THAT WE CAN BETTER

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.605
UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS?

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:20.441
YEAH. HAPPY TO TO TAKE A SHOT

01:26:20.508 --> 01:26:21.776
HERE. SO IN LOOKING AT THE

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.745
CHART ON SLIDE FIVE, WHEN YOU

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:24.579
SEE THAT THAT GREEN LINE

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.481
DIPPING WELL BELOW THE

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:27.749
COMPLIANCE CURVE, WHAT THAT

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:30.518
MEANS IS IN REAL TERMS,

01:26:30.585 --> 01:26:34.022
ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROVIDERS ARE

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:34.756
PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:37.158
OF CLEAN FUELS TO CALIFORNIA.

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:38.993
THEY'RE GENERATING MORE CREDITS

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:41.663
THAN THEY ACTUALLY THAN THAN

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:42.463
THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:43.731
DEFICIT SIDE, NEED TO COMPLY

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:44.866
WITH THE CARBON INTENSITY

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.935
REDUCTIONS IN THE REGULATION.

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:49.771
SO ULTIMATELY, THAT HAS

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:51.806
RESULTED IN WHAT WE CALL KIND

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:54.609
OF A CREDIT BANK. ENTITIES ARE

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:55.944
HOLDING ON TO CREDITS FOR

01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:57.512
POTENTIAL FUTURE COMPLIANCE.

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:59.781
THIS IS A KIND OF A NORMAL

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:00.548
FEATURE, THIS BANKING FEATURE

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.684
OF A OF A OF A PROGRAM SUCH AS

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:05.453
THIS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR THE

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.654
COMPLIANCE ENTITIES IN THE

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:09.023
FUTURE TO BE ABLE TO TO USE

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:09.591
THOSE BANKED CREDITS, WHICH

01:27:09.657 --> 01:27:10.692
MEANS THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:12.794
INTO THE MARKET AND BUY ANOTHER

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:14.395
CREDIT OR PRODUCE MORE CLEAN

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:15.630
FUEL. THEY'VE ALREADY GOT IT

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.398
SAVED UP, AND SO THEY CAN

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:18.499
SPREAD THOSE COMPLIANCE COSTS

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.734
OVER MANY YEARS BECAUSE THEY'VE

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.669
BEEN ABLE TO TO BANK THESE

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:23.071
CREDITS AND SAVE THEM FOR

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:23.705
FUTURE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS.

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:25.607
SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON THERE.

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:26.774
THEY'RE CONTINUING TO PRODUCE

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:28.543
AND DELIVER FUELS ON THE

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.877
EXPECTATION AND ANTICIPATION

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:31.012
THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:32.513
THEY'LL HAVE SOME COMPLIANCE IN

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.715
THE FUTURE THAT THEY'LL NEED TO

01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:34.849
MEET. AND THEY'RE SAVING UP

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.718
THOSE CREDITS FOR FOR A RAINY

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:40.755
DAY ESSENTIALLY. SO IN TERMS OF

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:44.726
KIND OF QUESTIONS ON ON WHAT

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:47.629
THE THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED, WE

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:49.964
DID HAVE I DID HAVE SOME

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:52.600
STATISTICS ON WHAT WAS IT SLIDE

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:53.568
12 THAT GOES INTO THE

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:56.037
HISTORICAL BENEFITS OF THE

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.672
PROGRAM. AND THOSE ARE THE

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:59.507
BENEFITS THAT HAVE COME FROM

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:01.576
ALL OF THOSE FUELS AND CREDITS

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:02.644
THAT ARE ON THAT GREEN LINE. SO

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:04.579
AS THOSE WERE KIND OF BEING

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:05.747
DELIVERED IN. AND THEN YOUR

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.582
QUESTION ABOUT THE FUTURE, THAT

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:08.516
QUESTION BEFORE YOU GOT TO THAT

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:10.184
SLIDE. SO THANK YOU. THE FOLLOW

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:11.886
UP WOULD BE OUT OF THE EXAMPLES

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.788
THAT YOU PROVIDED ON THIS PAGE

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.089
OF THESE TYPES OF FUELS THAT

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:17.358
ARE BEING GENERATED AS A RESULT

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:17.959
OF THE CREDIT, DO ANY OF THEM

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:20.361
HAVE ANY OUTWEIGHED IN TERMS OF

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:23.064
THE PERCENTAGE OF, OF CREDITS

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.233
BEING APPLIED, OR IS THERE MORE

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:26.534
RENEWABLE DIESEL OR MORE

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:29.337
ETHANOL OR MORE HYDROGEN, LIKE

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:30.772
WHICH ONE IS PERFORMING AT

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:31.572
WHICH LEVELS? BECAUSE I KNOW

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:33.975
YOU GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:35.543
DIESEL VERSUS RENEWABLE DIESEL

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:38.646
AND THE IMPACTS OF THAT FROM A

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:39.380
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT.

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.982
APPRECIATE THAT THAT

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:42.617
DISTINCTION THERE. BUT ARE

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:44.419
THERE ANY OF THESE THAT ARE

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:45.620
OUTPERFORMING THE OTHERS IN ANY

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.489
SIGNIFICANT WAY? SO I'M GOING

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:50.058
TO KIND OF AVOID SAYING

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:50.792
OUTPERFORMING BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:28:50.858 --> 01:28:51.926
ALL DIFFERENT IN THEIR OWN

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:54.929
UNIQUE, SPECIAL WAYS. SO EACH

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.531
FUEL MAYBE I SHOULD MAYBE I

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:58.866
SHOULD OR ANY OF THESE SECTORS

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.668
PROVIDING MORE CARBON INTENSITY

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:02.737
REDUCTION THAN OTHERS. YEAH.

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:05.907
YES. BECAUSE EACH OF THE FUELS

01:29:05.973 --> 01:29:06.741
ARE ESSENTIALLY EVALUATED AND

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.509
SCORED BASED ON THEIR CARBON

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:09.711
INTENSITY. AND THOSE ARE CARBON

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:10.878
INTENSITIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:12.346
ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT FUELS.

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:15.216
WE HAVE SOME FUELS THAT HAVE

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:15.817
MUCH LOWER CARBON INTENSITIES

01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:17.485
RELATIVE TO OTHERS. SO TO GIVE

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:19.620
YOU A KIND OF A SENSE OF THIS,

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:22.056
YOU KNOW, RENEWABLE DIESEL

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:22.824
TYPICALLY FALLS ANYWHERE

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:26.894
BETWEEN 20G PER MEGAJOULE TO

01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:29.831
5560, DEPENDING ON WHAT IT'S

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:31.766
PRODUCED FROM AND HOW FAR IT

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:33.735
HAS TO COME TO BE DELIVERED. TO

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:35.770
COME TO CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.605
ELECTRICITY CREDITS, WE HAVE

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:38.840
LOW CI HYDROGEN CREDITS, AND WE

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:40.508
ALSO HAVE CREDITS FROM

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:42.210
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THAT COME

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:43.277
FROM CAPTURED METHANE. IT

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:45.079
DAIRIES AND OTHER METHANE

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:46.614
GENERATING SOURCES. AND THOSE

01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.783
CAN ACTUALLY GO INTO THE TO THE

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.651
NEGATIVE. SO EACH ONE OF THESE

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:51.886
FUELS GETS ITS OWN CARBON

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.421
INTENSITY SCORE. AND THEN THE

01:29:53.488 --> 01:29:54.789
TOTAL AMOUNT OF CREDIT REVENUE

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:57.258
THAT THEY GENERATE IS BASED OFF

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:58.626
OF THEIR SCORE AND THE VOLUMES

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:00.795
OF FUELS. SO YOU COULD HAVE A

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.430
REALLY, REALLY LOW CARBON

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:04.632
TECHNOLOGY. IT'S IT'S, YOU KNOW,

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:05.967
NOT PRODUCING ANY EMISSIONS AT

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:07.535
ALL. BUT IT COULD BE VERY

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:09.003
EXPENSIVE AND VERY HARD TO

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:09.837
PRODUCE VOLUMES OF FUELS. AND

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.439
SO YOU MIGHT NOT GENERATE THAT

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:12.740
MUCH MONEY FROM IT BECAUSE THE

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:15.109
VOLUMES ARE JUST NOT THERE. SO

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:15.710
MAYBE AS A FOLLOW UP, JUST OF

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:18.146
INTEREST FOR, FOR ME IS YOU,

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:20.248
YOU OBVIOUSLY TAKE A POINT IN

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:21.783
TIME ASSESSMENT OF, OF WHERE

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:24.786
WE'RE AT WITH THE INTENSITY,

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:25.486
BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHICH ONE

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:30.892
OF THESE NEW FUELS ARE THE MOST

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:32.760
CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO. THAT

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:33.961
WOULD BE JUST HELPFUL TO

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:35.763
UNDERSTAND. YOU MADE IT SOUND

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:36.898
LIKE IT'S DIESEL, BUT I'M NOT

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:38.533
SURE BY VOLUME. SURE, SURE. YES,

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:41.002
I SHOULD ANSWER THAT BY VOLUME.

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:42.436
THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE,

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:44.906
LOW CARBON FUEL THAT COMES TO

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.440
CALIFORNIA IS ETHANOL,

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:47.742
RENEWABLE DIESEL AND BIODIESEL.

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:51.045
SO THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST ONES

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:51.979
THAT ARE COMING TO CALIFORNIA.

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:54.715
AND WHAT WE DO EXPECT OVER TIME,

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.484
WILL, IS THAT ELECTRICITY WILL

01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:59.053
START TO SURPASS BOTH OF THE OR

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.555
ALL THREE OF THOSE AS MORE

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:02.623
CONSUMERS OPT INTO ZERO

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:03.658
EMISSION VEHICLES AND START

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:04.392
CHARGING WITH ELECTRICITY. SO

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:05.693
THAT WILL BECOME A MUCH BIGGER

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.628
PORTION OF THE PROGRAM INTO THE

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:08.529
FUTURE YEARS. I HAVE A FOLLOW

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:10.565
UP TO THAT BASED ON CHART 15,

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:11.732
BUT BEFORE THAT, IN YOUR

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:12.567
PREVIOUS ANSWER, YOU TALKED

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:15.469
ABOUT THE THE BANK, THE WAY THE

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:17.738
SYSTEM WORKS WITH THE BANKING,

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:19.974
DOES THAT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:21.776
THE IN THE MARKET IN TERMS OF

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.611
THE CREDIT AMOUNT AND WHERE

01:31:23.678 --> 01:31:26.214
WE'RE AT TODAY, BECAUSE THERE'S

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.415
SO MUCH THAT HAS BEEN BANKED,

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:28.816
GIVEN WHAT WE PROJECTED, WHERE

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:31.219
WE PROJECTED TO BE, IS THAT A

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.955
DRIVING FACTOR AT ALL? WELL,

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.790
AGAIN, WE DON'T YOU KNOW, WE

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:37.925
DON'T CONTROL THE SECONDARY

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:38.759
MARKET. AND WE ALSO DON'T, AS

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:40.528
THE REGULATOR, SPECULATE ON

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:43.664
CREDIT PRICES. BUT CERTAINLY IF

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:45.466
SOMEONE THAT GENERATES CREDITS

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:46.500
DECIDES TO WITHHOLD THOSE

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:47.802
CREDITS FROM THE MARKET AND NOT

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:48.936
SELL THEM INTO THE MARKET,

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:50.972
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:51.772
ON THE OVERALL SECONDARY PRICE

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:54.008
OF THOSE CREDITS. DO YOU GUYS

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:54.775
ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY OPINION ON

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:58.012
THAT AND ANY THOUGHTS SO THAT

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:00.781
WORK? WELL, I MEAN, I WILL SAY

01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:02.717
THAT AS A AS ADMINISTRATOR OF

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:05.586
THE PROGRAM, THE THE ABILITY TO

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.388
BANK CREDITS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:09.590
ASPECT OF HAVING A COST

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:10.825
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. AND IT'S

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:12.393
ALSO IMPORTANT FOR INVESTMENT

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.862
CERTAINTY. IF I'M DECIDING TO

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:15.963
BUILD A RENEWABLE FUELS

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.465
FACILITY, I'M GOING TO GENERATE

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.634
A LOT OF CREDITS. I NEED TO BE

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:20.902
ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:22.470
WORK BEST FOR MY BUSINESS. ON

01:32:22.536 --> 01:32:23.905
WHEN I'M GOING TO SELL THOSE

01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:25.473
CREDITS, OR HOW I'M GOING TO

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:27.575
HOLD ON TO OR USE THEM. TO THE

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:28.776
EXTENT THAT YOU START LIMITING

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:29.844
THE ABILITY TO BANK CREDITS, IT

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:30.912
HAS THESE DISTORTIONARY EFFECTS

01:32:30.978 --> 01:32:33.014
ON ON ON THE OVERALL COST

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.248
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM.

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.483
THANK YOU. IF WE COULD GO TO

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:36.651
SLIDE 15, PLEASE. THIS IS THE

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:37.685
CHART ON THE UPDATES THAT

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.620
OCCURRED TO THE PROGRAM, WHICH

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:40.922
WERE CERTAINLY CENTER OF LOTS

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.757
OF ATTENTION. CAN YOU CAN YOU

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:47.028
EXPLAIN HOW MUCH OF OF THE NEW

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:49.497
THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, WHICH

01:32:49.563 --> 01:32:51.832
I ASSUME WERE ADOPTED IN THAT

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:54.568
JULY DECISION? THAT'S CORRECT.

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:56.604
THEY WENT INTO EFFECT IN JULY.

01:32:56.671 --> 01:32:59.240
THEY WERE ADOPTED LAST FALL.

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:00.841
OKAY. SO AND THAT'S REFLECTED

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.511
IN THIS BLACK LINE HERE, THE

01:33:03.577 --> 01:33:05.146
NEW CARBON INTENSITY BENCHMARKS

01:33:05.212 --> 01:33:06.414
ARE REPRESENTED BY THE BLACK.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.783
AND HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS DRIVEN

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:11.052
BY SORT OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:12.453
GOING BACK TO SLIDE FIVE IN

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:15.089
WHERE WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING

01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:17.591
VERSUS OTHER STATE POLICIES.

01:33:17.658 --> 01:33:19.460
YOU MADE THAT DECISION BASED ON

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:22.697
SOME DATA OUT THERE. HOW MUCH?

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:24.398
BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A

01:33:24.465 --> 01:33:25.599
SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN TERMS OF

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:28.703
WHERE WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GO,

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:30.671
HOW MUCH OF IT HAS TO DO WITH

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:35.176
OUR 2045 GOALS VERSUS JUST THE

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:39.213
HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. SURE.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.552
YEAH. THE SCOPING PLAN

01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:46.420
IDENTIFIED THAT IN ORDER TO

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:48.956
CONTINUE TO STAY ON TRACK FOR

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:51.125
OUR 2030 TARGET AND TO MEET THE

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:52.526
CARBON NEUTRALITY TARGET FOR

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:55.463
2045, THAT WE WOULD NEED TO SEE

01:33:55.529 --> 01:33:56.597
ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS FROM THIS

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:59.033
PROGRAM. AND SO THAT INFORMED

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.569
THE ANALYSIS ON THE TRAJECTORY.

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:05.072
OKAY, ONLY JUST A COUPLE MORE

01:34:05.139 --> 01:34:10.544
QUESTIONS. THE I WROTE SOME

01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:12.980
NOTES, SO LET ME SEE IF I CAN

01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:13.748
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT I'M

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:14.682
TRYING TO ASK YOU HERE. HOW

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:16.951
DOES CARB ENSURE THAT LCFS

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:18.119
CREDITS ARE ADDITIONAL MEANING

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:19.954
THAT LCFS CREDITS GO TO

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:20.721
EMISSION REDUCTION ACTIVITIES?

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.523
ALSO, HOW MUCH OF THIS IS SO

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.558
THAT PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTAND

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:25.826
NEW INVESTMENTS IN INNOVATION

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:29.130
AND NEW TECHNOLOGY VERSUS

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:29.864
SUSTAINING POTENTIALLY PROGRAMS

01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:32.400
THAT ALREADY EXISTED PRIOR?

01:34:32.466 --> 01:34:37.571
YEAH. SO AT ITS CORE, THE LCFS

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.740
HELPS TO ATTRACT PRIVATE

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:41.409
INVESTMENT INTO CLEAN FUEL

01:34:41.475 --> 01:34:43.978
PRODUCTION, INTO TO ZERO

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.980
EMISSION VEHICLES AND

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:48.049
INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE ARE THESE

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:50.084
ARE THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:51.719
ARTICULATED AND, YOU KNOW, BEEN

01:34:51.786 --> 01:34:53.387
CONSISTENT IN SAYING ARE

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:54.555
NECESSARY FOR US TO HIT OUR

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:55.723
CLIMATE TARGETS, YOU KNOW, ZERO

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:56.857
EMISSION VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT,

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:57.892
MORE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS

01:34:57.958 --> 01:34:59.060
FROM THE TRANSPORTATION FUEL

01:34:59.126 --> 01:35:00.694
POOL. WE HAVE A MIX OF POLICIES

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:02.997
THAT THE STATE HAS ADOPTED TO

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:04.498
HELP GET US TO THOSE OBJECTIVES.

01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:06.667
SO IN THAT SENSE, THE LCFS HAS

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:07.902
NEVER INCLUDED AN ADDITIONALITY

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:09.637
TEST BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO HELP

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:11.505
PUSH US IN CONCERT WITH THESE

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:14.175
OTHER POLICIES THAT WE HAVE IN

01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:15.076
CALIFORNIA TOWARDS THOSE IN

01:35:15.142 --> 01:35:18.512
GOALS. YOU KNOW, THIS IS KIND

01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:20.748
OF NO DIFFERENT THAN, YOU KNOW,

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:21.382
HOW WE DON'T APPLY

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:22.883
ADDITIONALITY TESTS ON

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:23.417
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY, FOR

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:26.454
INSTANCE. SO THERE'S THE THE

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.655
ABILITY OF THIS PROGRAM TO HELP

01:35:27.721 --> 01:35:30.391
FACILITATE THOSE OTHER PROGRAM

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:32.693
GOALS IS IS IMPORTANT. IF WE

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.861
DID INCLUDE AN ADDITIONALITY

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:35.029
TEST, MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:36.564
THAT ARE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:38.132
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IN

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:40.501
TERMS OF ZERO EMISSION FUELS

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.837
AND VEHICLES AND LOW CARBON

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.839
FUELS, WOULD WOULD POSSIBLY NOT

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:47.675
BE ELIGIBLE. AND CAN I JUST ADD

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:48.742
ON TO THAT? YOU KNOW, THE ZERO

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:50.578
EMISSION VEHICLES IS A GREAT

01:35:50.644 --> 01:35:52.446
EXAMPLE BECAUSE WHEN WE DID THE

01:35:52.513 --> 01:35:53.948
COST ANALYSIS, FOR INSTANCE,

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:57.751
FOR ADVANCED CLEAN CARS TO, YOU

01:35:57.818 --> 01:36:00.221
KNOW, THAT ANALYSIS RELY IT'S A

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:02.756
DIRECT REGULATION ON

01:36:02.823 --> 01:36:03.491
MANUFACTURERS OF THE VEHICLES.

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:08.896
AND THAT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:11.398
LCFS WOULD WOULD HELP ACHIEVE

01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:14.702
THAT GOAL. IT IS A DIRECT

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:16.403
REGULATION, AND LCFS IS HELPING

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:18.672
TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:21.542
AND ACHIEVE THAT GOAL IN A

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:23.844
FASTER MANNER. I SKIPPED OVER

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:26.580
ONE SLIDE 19. WE SPOKE

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:29.116
ESPECIALLY CHAIR RANDOLPH,

01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:30.584
ABOUT THE FEDERAL ACTION, WHICH

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:31.919
THERE HAS BEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:34.488
FEDERAL ACTION. AND YOU

01:36:34.555 --> 01:36:36.624
IDENTIFIED, I THINK, AS SORT OF

01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:38.926
WAYS TO LEVERAGE THESE THESE

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:41.762
TYPES OF INVESTMENTS, MAYBE NOT

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:43.531
RELY, BUT CERTAINLY ARE BENEFIT.

01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:45.199
IT'S BENEFICIAL. THE FEDERAL

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:46.433
RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARDS AND

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.635
THE FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVES.

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:50.070
DOES THAT EVEN STILL EXIST

01:36:50.137 --> 01:36:52.439
TODAY AS A RESULT OF FEDERAL

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:55.342
ACTION THAT'S BEEN TAKEN? YEAH,

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:57.711
SURE. THE THE FEDERAL RENEWABLE

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:58.879
FUEL STANDARD IS STILL VERY

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.481
MUCH ALIVE. AND THERE IS AN

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:01.815
ACTIVE MARKET ASSOCIATED WITH

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:04.118
PRODUCTION OF FUELS IN THE SALE

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:05.519
OF RENEWABLE FUELS THROUGH THE

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:07.221
RFS PROGRAM, AND THEY RECEIVE

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:08.756
WHAT ARE CALLED RINS TO HELP

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:09.490
SUPPORT THEIR FUEL PRODUCTION.

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:10.724
THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGING

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:13.727
LANDSCAPE ON ADDITIONAL TAX

01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:15.496
CREDITS ASSOCIATED WITH FUEL

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:17.698
PRODUCTION, MOVING INTO

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.900
PROGRAMS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:20.701
AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS UNDER

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:23.237
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. THERE

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:25.606
ARE STILL, TO MY AWARENESS, A

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:26.607
LITTLE BIT OF ONGOING

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:27.608
UNCERTAINTY IN HOW THOSE

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:29.710
PROGRAMS WILL ROLL OUT, AND

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:31.378
THAT HAS FED ITS WAY INTO THE

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:32.546
BIOFUELS MARKET. I KNOW YOU

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:33.847
HAVE A NUMBER OF PRODUCERS, YOU

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:35.783
KNOW, IN THE LATER PANELS. IT'S

01:37:35.849 --> 01:37:37.451
A GOOD QUESTION FOR THEM. OKAY,

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:38.719
WE'LL DEFINITELY ASK THAT. AND

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.788
THEN ONE THING TO MAKE CLEAR ON

01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:42.523
PAGE 20, BECAUSE I THINK, YOU

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:44.391
KNOW, IF YOU DON'T SIT THROUGH

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:46.560
THIS PRESENTATION AND LISTEN

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:48.996
THAT I WANT TO SORT OF

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:51.498
JUXTAPOSE WITH PAGE 25, THE RED

01:37:51.565 --> 01:37:53.934
LINE IS NOT THE COST OF THE

01:37:54.001 --> 01:37:56.704
LCFS PER PER GALLON OF GAS.

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:58.839
THIS THIS SORT OF AGAIN, COULD

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:01.141
BE MISREAD THAT TWO BASICALLY

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:05.946
$2 IN JANUARY OR I DON'T KNOW

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:07.881
WHAT MONTH J OF 2024 WAS DUE TO

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:10.551
LCFS OUT OF THE COST, THE 450

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:11.986
THAT IT COST PER GALLON. JUST

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:14.555
CLARIFYING THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:15.789
AND AGAIN, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:18.626
ON PAGE 25 WHERE WE CAN

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:21.562
IDENTIFY WHAT THAT COST IS,

01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:23.764
THANKS TO THE WORK OF THE CDC

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:26.333
AND THE AUTHORITY THAT THEY

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.601
HAVE, WHICH I THINK, YOU KNOW,

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:28.869
WE'RE COMING TO THAT RECKONING

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:31.105
THAT I TALKED ABOUT, OF WHERE

01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:34.808
WE ARE. YOU KNOW, TWO, THREE

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:37.778
OVER 350 IS JUST ON THE

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:39.380
DISTRIBUTION, REFINING IN THE

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:41.548
CRUDE OIL COST, JUST COST TO DO

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:42.850
BUSINESS. THERE ARE SOME COSTS

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:43.584
ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE,

01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:45.519
YOU KNOW, LOW CARBON FUEL

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:47.354
STANDARDS. AS NOTED THERE.

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.522
OBVIOUSLY STATE AND LOCAL

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:50.624
GOVERNMENTS HAVE DECIDED TO TAX

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:51.792
THEMSELVES TO THERE'S A

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:53.394
COMPONENT OF THAT. BUT I THINK

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:54.828
IT'S THAT'S AN IMPORTANT SLIDE,

01:38:54.895 --> 01:38:55.896
JUST TO UNDERSTAND SORT OF

01:38:55.963 --> 01:38:57.865
WHERE WE'RE AT. AND JUST TO

01:38:57.931 --> 01:38:58.699
FINALIZE, I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:01.735
WOULD BE HOW DOES THE PRICE OF

01:39:01.802 --> 01:39:02.703
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:05.806
PER GALLON GET IMPACTED BY ALL

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:07.641
THE OTHER DECISIONS OF THE

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.143
PRICE PER GALLON, WHETHER IT'S

01:39:09.209 --> 01:39:10.377
CRUDE OIL REFINING, LIKE HOW

01:39:10.444 --> 01:39:12.780
HOW DOES THAT HOW DO WE SEE

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:13.981
THAT CHANGING? ACCORDING TO

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:15.482
SOME GRAPHS YOU HAVE IN HERE,

01:39:15.549 --> 01:39:16.817
IT'S PRETTY STEADY. REGARDLESS

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:18.952
OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH CRUDE OIL

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:20.521
AND EVERYTHING ELSE, LCFS STAYS

01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:22.623
PRETTY STEADY. IS THAT ACCURATE?

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.525
OR AND MAYBE VICE CHAIR, YOU

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:26.694
MAY BE ABLE TO BETTER GIVE US

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.228
AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMIC

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:29.563
THAT HAPPENS WITH THE LOW

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:30.898
CARBON FUEL STANDARD COMPONENT

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:32.766
OF PRICE PER GALLON. YEAH.

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.601
THANK YOU CHAIR. YEAH I THINK

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.870
THEY'RE PRETTY SEPARATED IN

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:38.605
TERMS OF THE MARKET. SO ON ONE

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:40.741
SIDE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LIFE

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:41.975
CYCLE OF THE CRUDE OIL MOVING

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.577
DOWN. AND WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:45.679
LCFS AND OTHERS. THEY ARE

01:39:45.746 --> 01:39:47.247
ASSESSED AT THE RAC OR THE

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:48.549
WHOLESALE MARKET. AND WHERE THE

01:39:48.615 --> 01:39:50.718
TRADING IS HAPPENING TO COMPLY

01:39:50.784 --> 01:39:52.586
WITH THE LCFS. SO THERE ARE TWO

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:55.756
SEPARATE MARKETS LARGELY. OKAY.

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:56.557
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. THANK

01:39:56.623 --> 01:40:00.527
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU,

01:40:00.594 --> 01:40:02.596
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. YEAH.

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:07.701
THANK YOU. SINCE IT'S RARE THAT

01:40:07.768 --> 01:40:09.703
WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE A

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:11.872
CARB LEADERSHIP BEFORE US, I

01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:12.873
JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.608
FIRST OF ALL, IN YOUR OPINION,

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:16.210
COULD WE EFFECTIVELY FOLD

01:40:16.276 --> 01:40:17.911
FEATURES OF LCFS PROGRAM INTO

01:40:17.978 --> 01:40:20.581
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THAT

01:40:20.647 --> 01:40:22.149
WOULD GIVE US GREATER

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:23.050
EFFICIENCY? IS THAT A

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:25.386
POSSIBILITY? NO, THE PROGRAMS

01:40:25.452 --> 01:40:28.489
ARE REALLY THEY HAVE DIFFERENT

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:30.624
PARTICIPANTS. LCFS IS ONLY

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:33.527
ABOUT TRANSPORTATION FUELS,

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:36.029
WHEREAS CAP AND TRADE IS THE

01:40:36.096 --> 01:40:37.498
ENTIRE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. SO IT

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.800
COVERS MANY THINGS OTHER THAN

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:42.770
JUST FUELS. AND THEY'RE

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:45.372
STRUCTURED VERY DIFFERENTLY. SO

01:40:45.439 --> 01:40:50.077
THE SHORT ANSWER IS IS NO. OKAY.

01:40:50.144 --> 01:40:52.112
AND MY SECOND QUESTION ALSO

01:40:52.179 --> 01:40:54.181
DOESN'T RELATE OR RELATE

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:55.649
DIRECTLY TO LCFS. BUT IN YOUR

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:57.651
OPINION, SHOULD REFINERIES BE

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:59.553
CLASSIFIED INTO THE HIGH TRADE

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.155
EXPOSED CATEGORY FOR THE

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:03.157
PURPOSES OF CAP AND TRADE? WITH

01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:04.625
THE RECENT CLOSURES, IT WOULD

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:07.027
SEEM THAT THEY ARE IN FACT HIGH

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:09.797
TRADE EXPOSED. SO WHEN CAP AND

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:12.132
TRADE WAS REAUTHORIZED IN AB

01:41:12.199 --> 01:41:15.636
398, THE LEGISLATURE LAID OUT

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:18.872
THE THE LEAKAGE RISK FOR

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:19.673
INDUSTRY AND BASICALLY SAID

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.476
EVERYBODY AT A HIGH LEAKAGE

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:27.080
RISK. SO EVERYONE IS HAS A HIGH.

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:29.817
FACTOR. SO REFINERIES CONTINUE

01:41:29.883 --> 01:41:33.620
TO TO GET THEIR ALLOWANCES

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:35.622
BASED ON THAT LEAKAGE RISK THAT

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:38.792
IS SET IN AB 398. THAT'S

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:40.427
HELPFUL BECAUSE CAP AND TRADE

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.529
IS COMING BEFORE US HERE VERY

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:44.965
SOON. SO THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:47.668
MEMBER SHARP COLLINS. THANK YOU.

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:48.969
I'M JUST GOING GOING BACK TO

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:51.004
SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:51.705
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALVAREZ WAS

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:53.507
TOUCHING ON. AND I JUST WANT TO

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:54.741
MAKE SURE THAT I HAVEN'T MISSED

01:41:54.808 --> 01:41:57.544
IT. SO I THINK, MATT, AS YOU

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:59.546
WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:00.681
ANSWERING THE QUESTION WHETHER

01:42:00.747 --> 01:42:03.116
OR NOT WE ARE PROVIDING MORE CR

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.685
REDUCTION THAN OTHERS, AND THEN

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.420
THEN YOU RESPONDED YES, WITH IN

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:09.156
SOME CASES. SO I'M JUST

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:09.656
WONDERING WITHIN THE CI

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:13.927
CONVERSATION, WHY ARE WE

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:14.695
UTILIZING A CARBON INTENSITY

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:16.096
SCORE IN THE MARKET MECHANISM

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:17.898
RATHER THAN THE DIRECT

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:18.765
REGULATIONS, AND JUST MAKE SURE

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:21.235
I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING? ADDING

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:23.637
TO THAT CONVERSATION? YES. SO

01:42:23.704 --> 01:42:24.872
THIS GOES BACK TO MY COFFEE

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:29.009
ANALOGY AND THE THE FACT THAT

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:30.677
THE LCFS PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED

01:42:30.744 --> 01:42:34.348
TO BE PROVIDING COST EFFECTIVE

01:42:34.414 --> 01:42:35.949
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IN

01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:37.751
THE TRANSPORTATION SPACE AND

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:40.554
THE WAY IT'S DESIGNED HELPS TO

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:43.457
DO THAT BY PUSHING FOR THE

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:46.660
LOWEST CARBON FUELS AND THE

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:48.428
LARGEST VOLUMES, AND FOR THOSE

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:49.763
FUELS TO CONTINUE TO ITERATE

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.032
AND REDUCE THEIR CARBON

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:52.599
INTENSITY OVER TIME. WE HAVE

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:55.636
SOME FUEL PRODUCERS THAT HAVE

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:57.571
PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM FOR

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:59.640
A NUMBER OF YEARS, AND THEY

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:00.707
KEEP REAPPLYING BECAUSE THEY

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:02.609
FIND NEW WAYS TO DROP THE

01:43:02.676 --> 01:43:03.744
CARBON INTENSITY OF THEIR

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.479
EXISTING FUEL PRODUCTION. AND

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:07.614
THEY WOULDN'T BE DOING THAT IF

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:09.182
IT WASN'T FOR THE WAY IN WHICH

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.517
THE THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:12.619
TO REWARD THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR.

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:13.954
AND SO THAT HELPS CALIFORNIA

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:15.489
BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THEY'RE

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:17.591
INVESTING. IT MEANS THAT

01:43:17.658 --> 01:43:18.458
THEY'RE REDUCING THEIR

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:20.494
EMISSIONS. AND THEY'RE DOING

01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:21.728
THEY'RE FINDING WAYS TO BE

01:43:21.795 --> 01:43:23.830
ECONOMICALLY VIABLE IN DOING IT

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:25.766
WITHOUT NEEDING ANY PUBLIC

01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:30.704
SUBSIDIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:31.872
FOR FOR CLARIFYING THAT. AND

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:34.675
THEN I'M STILL GOING TO I THINK

01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:36.710
IT WAS SLIDE 12, THE SAME THING

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:37.511
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:40.080
MAKING THE EVS MORE, MORE

01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:42.482
AFFORDABLE. AND SO I JUST

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:43.617
CONTINUE TO GO INTO THE

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:45.719
CONVERSATION OF HAVING THE

01:43:45.786 --> 01:43:46.486
AFFORDABILITY PART OF IT,

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:47.454
BECAUSE YOU SAID MORE

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:48.855
AFFORDABLE FOR COMMERCIAL USE.

01:43:48.922 --> 01:43:51.925
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO IS THERE

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:53.760
ANYTHING THAT WE CAN KIND OF

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:55.996
HIGHLIGHT THAT REALLY SHOWS THE

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:57.764
AFFORDABILITY SIDE OF IT? AS WE

01:43:57.831 --> 01:43:59.533
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE THE

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.535
URBAN COMMUNITIES, THE LOW

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:02.803
INCOME COMMUNITIES, AND, YOU

01:44:02.869 --> 01:44:04.605
KNOW, IN SOME OF THE OTHER

01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:05.806
SECTORS JUST TO REALLY SEE

01:44:05.872 --> 01:44:08.475
WHERE THEY AT NOW AND JUST HOW

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:10.043
MUCH AFFORDABLE IS GOING TO BE,

01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:11.878
OR AT LEAST TRY TO PROJECT OUT

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:14.514
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY

01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:17.150
HAVING A REAL DEEP DIVE INTO

01:44:17.217 --> 01:44:17.784
AFFORDABLE CONVERSATIONS, AS IT

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:20.621
WILL IMPACT A NUMBER OF OF MY

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:21.888
CONSTITUENTS AS WELL, AND SOME

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:23.123
OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:24.658
THERE AS RIGHT NOW WHEN IT

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:25.959
COMES DOWN TO BEING ABLE TO

01:44:26.026 --> 01:44:26.660
PURCHASE THE VEHICLES OR

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.662
GETTING THEM, A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:29.830
ARE SECONDHAND OR WHICHEVER,

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:30.530
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REALLY

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:31.632
AFFORD, YOU KNOW, TO BUY NEW

01:44:31.698 --> 01:44:33.767
AND ETC. SO I'M JUST I'M GOING

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:35.836
INTO THE EQUITY SIDE OF IT AND

01:44:35.902 --> 01:44:36.603
THE ACCESS SIDE OF THE

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:37.738
CONVERSATION. I JUST DIDN'T

01:44:37.804 --> 01:44:40.040
HEAR MUCH OF THE EQUITY AND

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:40.674
ACCESS SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION.

01:44:40.741 --> 01:44:42.476
YEAH. THANK YOU, DOCTOR COLLINS.

01:44:42.542 --> 01:44:46.179
I, I WILL START BY SORT OF

01:44:46.246 --> 01:44:49.049
IDENTIFYING HOW LCFS SUPPORTS

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:51.118
ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:53.720
GENERALLY. SO THERE'S A FEW

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:55.622
DIFFERENT WAYS IT SUPPORTS WHAT

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:57.824
WE CALL CAPACITY CREDITS, WHICH

01:44:57.891 --> 01:45:00.193
MATT MENTIONED, WHICH MAKE

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:03.463
ALLOW FOR ZERO EMISSION

01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:05.599
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE DEPLOYED,

01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:07.768
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:09.736
FOR ADOPTION. YOU KNOW, A LOT

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:12.139
OF PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE SINGLE

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:13.707
FAMILY HOMES AND A GARAGE TO

01:45:13.774 --> 01:45:16.410
PARK AND CHARGE THEIR CAR IN.

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:18.612
SO ENSURING THAT THOSE FAST

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:19.646
CHARGING OPPORTUNITIES ARE

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:22.716
AVAILABLE AND AND THE CAPACITY

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:24.818
CREDITS ORIGINALLY STARTED WITH

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:27.521
JUST LIGHT DUTY AND MANY

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:29.523
COMPANIES, INCLUDING TESLA,

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:31.758
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF LCFS CREDITS

01:45:31.825 --> 01:45:34.428
TO GET THAT NETWORK OUT THERE

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:37.864
FOR PEOPLE TO USE. AND NOW THAT

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:40.100
NETWORK IS OPEN TO MORE MODELS

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:42.969
OF VEHICLES. IN ADDITION, THE

01:45:43.036 --> 01:45:45.572
NEW AMENDMENTS EXPANDED THOSE

01:45:45.639 --> 01:45:47.674
CAPACITY CREDITS FOR HEAVY DUTY,

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:49.910
WHICH, AGAIN, IS REALLY

01:45:49.976 --> 01:45:51.945
CRITICAL BECAUSE THOSE STATIONS

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.647
ARE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD, REQUIRE

01:45:53.714 --> 01:45:57.651
A LOT OF POWER, AND MAKING SURE

01:45:57.718 --> 01:46:01.121
THAT THOSE ARE DEPLOYED FOR THE

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:02.622
TRANSITION IN THE HEAVY DUTY

01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:05.058
SECTOR, WHICH REALLY BENEFITS

01:46:05.125 --> 01:46:06.193
COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, THE

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:09.229
PROGRAM HAS HISTORICALLY FUNDED

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:11.465
VEHICLE REBATES THROUGH THE

01:46:11.531 --> 01:46:13.266
UTILITY PROGRAMS FOR THE

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:17.204
UTILITIES THAT ARE PROVIDING

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:19.172
ELECTRICITY. THEY ARE PROVIDING

01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:21.074
FUEL, AND SO THEY EARN CREDITS

01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:24.478
FOR PROVIDING THAT FUEL. AND

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.580
THOSE CREDITS ARE USED

01:46:26.646 --> 01:46:28.782
HISTORICALLY FOR LIGHT DUTY

01:46:28.849 --> 01:46:30.650
VEHICLE CREDITS. IN THE

01:46:30.717 --> 01:46:32.853
AMENDMENTS, WE ORIENTED THOSE

01:46:32.919 --> 01:46:35.956
CREDITS TOWARDS HEAVY DUTY

01:46:36.022 --> 01:46:37.457
VEHICLES, AGAIN, BECAUSE THAT

01:46:37.524 --> 01:46:40.660
SECTOR NEEDS A LOT OF WORK TO

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:43.563
CONTINUE TO GROW. IT IS DOING

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:45.532
WELL. IT IS AHEAD OF WHAT WE

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:47.834
PROJECTED IT WOULD BE, BUT IT

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:49.803
STILL NEEDS NEEDS, A LOT OF

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:52.038
WORK. AND SO THE CREDITS HELP

01:46:52.105 --> 01:46:55.509
DEPLOY THOSE VEHICLES AS WELL.

01:46:55.575 --> 01:46:58.645
AND I THINK THAT'S IT. ANYTHING

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:00.614
YOU WANTED TO ADD, MATT, ON

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.816
JUST MAYBE ONE SMALLER POINT IS

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:04.684
THAT AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED,

01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:06.686
THE UTILITIES, DO YOU KNOW,

01:47:06.753 --> 01:47:08.421
REINVEST THE THE PROCEEDS OF

01:47:08.488 --> 01:47:10.657
THE EV CHARGING THAT HAPPENS ON

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:11.658
THEIR NETWORKS, A PORTION OF

01:47:11.725 --> 01:47:14.995
THAT, YOU KNOW, PURSUANT TO THE

01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:16.062
REGULATION AND DECISIONS BY THE

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:19.166
PUC ARE DIRECTED FOR EQUITY

01:47:19.232 --> 01:47:22.869
PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY? YEAH.

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:25.272
THANK YOU. JUST A FEW FOLLOW UP

01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:28.642
QUESTIONS. ONE IS RELATED TO

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:29.810
THE CONVERSATION WITH MY

01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:31.845
CO-CHAIR, ALVAREZ, ABOUT THE

01:47:31.912 --> 01:47:32.679
BANKING CREDITS AND PEOPLE

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:36.583
SAVING CREDITS. DOES DOES WHAT

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:38.685
DOES IMPACT OF PEOPLE SAVING

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:39.920
CREDITS HAVE ON DEMAND, AND

01:47:39.986 --> 01:47:44.124
WHAT IMPACT DOES IT HAVE ON THE

01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:48.295
CHART OF THE THE PRICE? I THINK

01:47:48.361 --> 01:47:53.200
IT WAS SLIDE 11. YEAH. SO AGAIN,

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:56.670
TO THE POINT THAT IF OUR

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:59.539
ENTITIES ARE SITTING AND NOT

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:00.807
SELLING CREDITS INTO THE MARKET,

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:02.042
THEIR THEIR BANKING, THESE

01:48:02.108 --> 01:48:03.610
CREDITS FOR FUTURE COMPLIANCE,

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:05.745
THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY KIND OF

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:07.581
HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE THE

01:48:07.647 --> 01:48:08.849
PRICING IN WHICH THE SECONDARY

01:48:08.915 --> 01:48:10.717
MARKET IS CLEARING ANY, ANY

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:14.788
CREDIT TRANSACTIONS AT. SO JUST

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:15.555
LIKE ANY OTHER MARKET, THIS IS

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:17.657
ONE WHERE IT'S A, YOU KNOW,

01:48:17.724 --> 01:48:18.792
THEY'RE TYPICALLY KIND OF

01:48:18.859 --> 01:48:19.693
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BUYERS AND

01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:21.561
SELLERS ON THE VOLUME OF

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:22.562
CREDITS THEY'RE LOOKING TO

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:23.797
PURCHASE OR SELL, THE PRICE

01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:24.898
THEY'RE GOING TO PURCHASE OR

01:48:24.965 --> 01:48:27.701
SELL AT THE, THE, THE DATA

01:48:27.767 --> 01:48:29.469
THAT'S ON THE SLIDE, THAT'S IN

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:32.973
MY SLIDE DECK COMES FROM THREE

01:48:33.039 --> 01:48:35.642
SOURCES. WE ASK THAT THE CREDIT

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:36.877
TRANSACTIONS ARE REPORTED TO

01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:38.445
CARB BECAUSE WE KEEP TRACK OF

01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:40.614
WHO OWNS WHAT CREDIT, AND WE

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.882
ASK WHAT PRICE. THEY THEY AGREE

01:48:41.948 --> 01:48:43.283
TO THESE TRANSACTIONS THAT

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.750
THROUGH THESE PRIVATE

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:45.418
TRANSACTIONS. AND THEN THERE'S

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:47.420
ALSO SECONDARY DATA MARKET

01:48:47.487 --> 01:48:49.923
PROVIDERS THAT THAT TRACK THESE

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.724
TRANSACTIONS OUTSIDE OF OF THE

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:54.961
PUBLIC SECTOR. AS FAR AS KIND

01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:55.829
OF WHAT THE NET EFFECT OF

01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:59.032
BANKING CREDITS HAS ON THE KIND

01:48:59.099 --> 01:48:59.833
OF OVERALL PRICE. AGAIN, YOU

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.601
KNOW, I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:03.670
JUST THE REGULATOR, I CAN'T

01:49:03.737 --> 01:49:05.138
SPECULATE ON ON, ON MARKET

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:06.907
PRICES ON THIS. SO, YOU KNOW,

01:49:06.973 --> 01:49:08.408
I'M SURE OTHERS WILL BE HAPPY

01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:10.477
TO GIVE YOU THEIR OPINION AND

01:49:10.543 --> 01:49:12.579
JUST WAS BRINGING IT UP BECAUSE

01:49:12.646 --> 01:49:13.780
YOU MADE THE COMMENT ABOUT

01:49:13.847 --> 01:49:14.547
BANKING CREDITS. AND I WONDER

01:49:14.614 --> 01:49:16.650
WHAT ROLE WE'VE SEEN THE DROP

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:17.817
OVER TIME. AND YOU HAVE IT

01:49:17.884 --> 01:49:19.586
VISUALLY STATED HERE. AND AS A

01:49:19.653 --> 01:49:20.820
REGULATOR, I KNOW THAT'S NOT

01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:22.689
YOUR PURPOSE, BUT I JUST

01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:23.690
WONDERED WHAT OTHER MARKET

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:24.724
FACTORS HAVE IN THE DROP. SOME

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:25.892
SPECULATE IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE

01:49:25.959 --> 01:49:28.495
TALKING ABOUT IT. SOME

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:29.663
SPECULATE BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:49:29.729 --> 01:49:31.731
GLUTTONY OF PRODUCT. RIGHT? I

01:49:31.798 --> 01:49:32.666
MEAN, OF GLUTTONY OF THIS TYPE

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:34.601
OF PRODUCT. AND SO THAT IS

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:36.937
HAVING AN IMPACT ON PRICES. AND

01:49:37.003 --> 01:49:38.939
SO I JUST WONDERED IF YOU HAD

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:40.674
OPINIONS AND IF IT WAS AT ALL

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.808
RELATED TO THE COMMENT ABOUT

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:42.642
THE BANKING FEATURE. YEAH. NO,

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:45.745
NO, WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:46.579
BECAUSE OF THE REPORTING

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:49.649
REQUIREMENTS IN OUR REGULATION,

01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:51.451
WE HAVE VASTLY MORE INFORMATION

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:52.686
THAT WE PUBLISH ABOUT THE

01:49:52.752 --> 01:49:54.421
DEPLOYMENT OF LOW CARBON FUELS

01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:56.589
THAN THAN WE HAVE HISTORICALLY.

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:57.891
AND, YOU KNOW, THANKS TO THE

01:49:57.958 --> 01:50:00.393
CDC, WE'RE NOW GETTING LOTS OF

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:00.994
GOOD INFORMATION, TOO, ABOUT

01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:02.796
COSTS ON PETROLEUM REFINING.

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:05.465
BUT THE LCFS DATA WE HAVE FOR

01:50:05.532 --> 01:50:06.666
YEARS NOW POSTED THAT

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:08.802
INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE ON A

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:10.603
QUARTERLY BASIS. WE PUBLISH HOW

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:11.871
MUCH FUEL IS BROUGHT INTO

01:50:11.938 --> 01:50:13.406
CALIFORNIA, HOW MANY CREDITS

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:14.741
THEY GENERATE. WE HAVE CARBON

01:50:14.808 --> 01:50:16.710
INTENSITY DATA ON THAT. ON OUR

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:17.577
WEBSITE. WE POST UPDATES ON

01:50:17.644 --> 01:50:19.913
CREDIT PRICE TRANSACTIONS. SO

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.715
ALL OF THIS IS VERY TRANSPARENT.

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:22.682
AND IF YOU'RE PARTICIPATING IN

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:24.617
THE MARKET, YOU'RE A FUEL

01:50:24.684 --> 01:50:25.819
SUPPLIER OR CREDIT BUYER. YOU

01:50:25.885 --> 01:50:27.420
CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:28.621
THIS MARKET. YOU CAN MAKE

01:50:28.688 --> 01:50:30.190
DECISIONS. AND THAT CERTAINLY,

01:50:30.256 --> 01:50:31.458
YOU KNOW, INFLUENCES THE

01:50:31.524 --> 01:50:32.726
ULTIMATE PRICE AT WHICH YOU'RE

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.828
WILLING TO SELL OR BUY A CREDIT

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:36.396
AT. SOUNDS GREAT. AND THEN YOU

01:50:36.463 --> 01:50:39.866
NOTED THAT, AND I WROTE IT DOWN,

01:50:39.933 --> 01:50:41.501
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I

01:50:41.568 --> 01:50:43.036
UNDERSTOOD WHO YOU WERE TALKING

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:43.937
ABOUT. YOU SAID HELP COMPANIES

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.739
GAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OR

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:48.942
COMPETITIVE EDGE, WHICH

01:50:49.009 --> 01:50:51.478
COMPANIES? WHO IS THAT IN

01:50:51.544 --> 01:50:52.779
REFERENCE TO? WHAT COMPANIES

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:55.548
ARE RECEIVING A COMPETITIVE

01:50:55.615 --> 01:51:01.955
ADVANTAGE OR EDGE THROUGH THIS?

01:51:02.022 --> 01:51:03.790
CHECKING MY NOTES. SORRY, WE

01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:05.658
CAN COME BACK TO IT. I HAVE

01:51:05.725 --> 01:51:06.860
OTHER QUESTIONS, BUT YOU, IF

01:51:06.926 --> 01:51:09.195
YOU CAN FIND THAT ONE, THAT'D

01:51:09.262 --> 01:51:10.630
BE GREAT. AND THEN SURE. NO, I

01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:12.799
THINK THIS WAS THIS WAS MAYBE

01:51:12.866 --> 01:51:14.467
THE COMMENT I MADE ON MY MY

01:51:14.534 --> 01:51:16.036
REMARKS AT THE LAST SLIDE, IF

01:51:16.102 --> 01:51:17.771
THAT SOUNDS RIGHT, AND WHAT I

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:19.472
WAS REFERRING TO WAS NOT ANY

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:21.841
SPECIFIC COMPANY, BUT REALLY

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:23.610
THE THE DYNAMICS THAT ARE

01:51:23.676 --> 01:51:24.711
HAPPENING NOW IN THE

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:25.879
TRANSPORTATION FUEL MARKET MORE

01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:29.949
BROADLY, WHEREBY WE HAVE

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:31.751
HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES PROVIDING

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:33.686
ALTERNATIVE FUELS. WE HAVE

01:51:33.753 --> 01:51:36.790
DIFFERENT FUELING OPTIONS FOR

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:38.992
CONSUMERS BETWEEN, YOU KNOW,

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:39.793
BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR

01:51:39.859 --> 01:51:41.561
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES, OR

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:43.596
FILLING UP WITH GASOLINE OR ON

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:44.531
THE DIESEL SIDE, YOU CAN BUY

01:51:44.597 --> 01:51:46.599
RENEWABLE DIESEL BIODIESEL, YOU

01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:48.835
CAN BUY BATTERY, ELECTRIC TRUCK

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:49.669
OR HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

01:51:49.736 --> 01:51:52.705
VEHICLE. THAT IS CREATING A LOT

01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:54.841
OF DIVERSITY IN BOTH THE

01:51:54.908 --> 01:51:56.843
TECHNOLOGY FOR FOR VEHICLES AND

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:59.512
IN HOW YOU FUEL THOSE VEHICLES.

01:51:59.579 --> 01:52:00.680
AND THAT DIVERSITY IS

01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:02.615
INCREASING OVERALL COMPETITION

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:04.551
FOR THAT CONSUMER DOLLAR. ON

01:52:04.617 --> 01:52:05.852
HOW YOU GET FROM POINT A TO

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:07.520
POINT B. SO THE POINT I WAS

01:52:07.587 --> 01:52:09.522
MAKING WAS JUST HOW WE ARE

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:10.857
PUSHING INTO A MORE DIVERSIFIED

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:12.459
FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM THAT HAS A

01:52:12.525 --> 01:52:14.661
LOT OF BAKED IN COMPETITION.

01:52:14.727 --> 01:52:15.929
THANK YOU. AND THEN THE LAST

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.630
QUESTION IS FOR VICE CHAIR

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:20.200
GUNDA IN YOUR SLIDES, YOU NOTED

01:52:20.266 --> 01:52:22.635
THE BREAKOUT OF OF THE LOW

01:52:22.702 --> 01:52:23.870
CARBON FUEL STANDARD. AND AS WE

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:25.371
UNDERSTAND IT, THIS INCLUDES

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:28.007
THE MOST RECENT THIS MONTH. AND

01:52:28.074 --> 01:52:29.242
SO THIS INCLUDES THE THE THE

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:31.544
THE AMENDMENT IN PLACE NOW. AND

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:33.713
SO IS TYPICALLY PEOPLE ALWAYS

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:35.615
ASK WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT

01:52:35.682 --> 01:52:36.783
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THEY

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:38.518
ARE LIKE IS IT. THEY FEEL LIKE

01:52:38.585 --> 01:52:41.621
IT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING WITH

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:43.423
EVERY MONTH. AND THAT WOULDN'T

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:44.824
BE AN ACCURATE STATEMENT, WOULD

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:47.427
IT, THAT IT'S A CONSTANT

01:52:47.494 --> 01:52:48.628
CHANGING NUMBER. IT'S REALLY

01:52:48.695 --> 01:52:49.796
BASED ON THE POLICY AND THEN

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:51.564
SHIFTS, OR IS IT A CONSTANT

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:53.032
CHANGING NUMBER? YEAH, I THINK

01:52:53.099 --> 01:52:54.734
THE SO BOTH OF THEM ARE TRUE.

01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:56.870
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I

01:52:56.936 --> 01:52:58.571
CLARIFY. SO ON ANY GIVEN DAY,

01:52:58.638 --> 01:53:00.773
THE LCFS PRICE, YOU KNOW, AS

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.642
NOTED BY OPUS AND OTHERS, COULD

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:04.744
CHANGE A FRACTION OF A CENT, IT

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:07.046
COULD GO UP AND DOWN, BUT IT'S

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:09.382
VERY STABLE OVERALL. SO IF YOU

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:10.650
LOOK AT LAST YEAR, THE AVERAGE

01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:12.719
PRICE WAS ABOUT $0.09. AND

01:53:12.785 --> 01:53:14.387
SINCE THE NEW AMENDMENTS WENT

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:17.123
IN, WE HAD ABOUT $0.14 TODAY.

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:18.858
AND IT'S PRETTY STABLE. AND SO

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:20.627
IF WE GOT BACK TO WHERE I THINK

01:53:20.693 --> 01:53:22.695
ON THAT ONE CHARGE THAT WE'RE

01:53:22.762 --> 01:53:23.863
ABOUT $200 IS TRADING, THAT,

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:25.632
WOULD THAT HAVE AN IMPACT ON A

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:27.333
CONSUMER'S WHAT THEY'RE PAYING

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.635
AT THE PUMP. SO YES, IT'S JUST

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:30.737
KIND OF A 30,000 FOOT LEVEL TO

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:32.739
JUST KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT I

01:53:32.805 --> 01:53:36.409
TRACK WHAT. DIRECTOR BOTTLE WAS

01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:37.577
OFFERING. I THINK THERE'S TWO

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:39.712
PARTS TO THE OVERALL PROCESS.

01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:41.548
SO AS THE MARKET IS DECIDING,

01:53:41.614 --> 01:53:43.650
I'M IN A DEFICIT AND I WANT TO

01:53:43.716 --> 01:53:44.884
BUY, THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:46.419
CREDITS AND THE CREDIT PRICE

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:47.620
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO BUY AS

01:53:47.687 --> 01:53:49.689
MUCH AS THEY CAN. AND I THINK

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:51.424
FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE, THE

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:52.692
DIFFERENT PLAYERS ARE MAKING

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:54.260
SURE THEY TAKE POSITIONS ON

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:55.595
THESE CREDITS IN A WAY THAT

01:53:55.662 --> 01:53:58.131
BEST PROVIDES THEM COMPETITIVE

01:53:58.198 --> 01:53:59.899
ADVANTAGE. RIGHT. SO SO THEY

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:01.634
KIND OF BUY THEM IN THAT IN

01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:04.070
THAT SENSE. SO THE CREDIT PRICE

01:54:04.137 --> 01:54:05.471
DOESN'T NECESSARILY TRANSLATE

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:07.640
TO THE PRICE THAT THE GALLON

01:54:07.707 --> 01:54:08.508
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE IT DEPENDS

01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:10.677
ON HOW THEY'RE REPORTING. YOU

01:54:10.743 --> 01:54:13.146
KNOW, HOW THEY BANK IT INTO THE

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:13.947
COMPLIANCE MECHANISM. OKAY.

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:17.016
THANK YOU. CAN I ADD TO THAT.

01:54:17.083 --> 01:54:19.285
DIRECTOR BATTELLE MENTIONED

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:21.654
EARLIER AS WELL. YOU KNOW,

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:22.488
CREDIT BUYING CREDITS IS ONE

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:25.658
OPTION IN COMPLIANCE. RIGHT.

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:27.427
AND SO COMPANIES ARE ALSO

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:28.595
MAKING THEIR OWN INVESTMENTS.

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:29.696
THEY'RE ALSO DEVELOPING THEIR

01:54:29.762 --> 01:54:31.564
OWN PROGRAMS. AND SO THAT YOU

01:54:31.631 --> 01:54:33.800
KNOW ALSO SORT OF IS IN THE MIX.

01:54:33.866 --> 01:54:35.535
SO IT'S VERY HARD TO SORT OF

01:54:35.602 --> 01:54:36.736
TRACK EXACTLY THAT THAT

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:38.771
STRAIGHT LINE. RIGHT. THANK YOU.

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:40.640
AND AND FOLLOW UP TO THIS. THEN

01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:43.109
WHEN WE LOOK IN 2025 ON THE

01:54:43.176 --> 01:54:46.713
LAST SLIDE. YOU CAN SEE WHERE

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:47.914
THE VOLATILITY. WELL YOU CAN

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:49.549
SEE ON THE WHOLE THING WHERE

01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:50.650
THE VOLATILITY IS, IT'S THE

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:53.353
INDUSTRY COST AND PROFITS AND

01:54:53.419 --> 01:54:54.687
CRUDE OIL. BUT IN COMPARISON TO

01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:56.689
PREVIOUS YEARS YOU SEE A LOT A

01:54:56.756 --> 01:54:59.892
LITTLE BIT OF VOLATILITY IN THE

01:54:59.959 --> 01:55:01.794
2025 PORTION OF THE BOTTOM

01:55:01.861 --> 01:55:04.864
THREE. THE BURGUNDY, BLUE AND

01:55:04.931 --> 01:55:07.033
GREEN IN COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:08.001
YEARS. WHAT WOULD YOU ATTRIBUTE

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:10.069
THAT TO? YEAH, I WOULD

01:55:10.136 --> 01:55:11.504
DEFINITELY KIND OF, YOU KNOW,

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:14.040
PASS IT TO CAR. BUT I THINK,

01:55:14.107 --> 01:55:14.941
YOU KNOW, THE THE COMPLIANCE

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:16.476
DATE WHICH WENT INTO JULY, I

01:55:16.542 --> 01:55:18.645
THINK THERE WAS SOME LACK OF

01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:19.812
CLARITY IN THE INDUSTRY

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:22.115
STARTING IN, IN JUNE 1ST. SO

01:55:22.181 --> 01:55:24.117
JANUARY 1ST, I'LL JUST PASS IT

01:55:24.183 --> 01:55:26.619
TO THE CHAIR TO EXPLAIN. YEAH.

01:55:26.686 --> 01:55:30.623
SO LCFS IS A LITTLE UNUSUAL IN

01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:32.725
THAT THE COMPLIANCE IS BASED ON

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:34.460
QUARTERLY. RIGHT. SO YOU'RE,

01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:35.595
YOU'RE YOU'RE EARNING YOUR,

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:37.730
YOUR INCURRING DEFICITS AND

01:55:37.797 --> 01:55:39.766
PURCHASING CREDITS ON A

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:44.470
QUARTERLY BASIS. AND SO THAT

01:55:44.537 --> 01:55:47.140
QUARTERLY PIECE HAS A, YOU KNOW,

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:49.142
IT'S A TIME COMPONENT WHEN WE

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:51.044
WHEN WE SUBMITTED ADOPTED IN

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.412
FALL SUBMITTED THE PACKAGE TO

01:55:52.478 --> 01:55:55.715
OIL, I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:56.582
ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD GET

01:55:56.649 --> 01:55:59.018
APPROVED, AND IT WOULD GO INTO

01:55:59.085 --> 01:55:59.919
EFFECT ON JANUARY 1ST, WHICH

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:01.821
WOULD BE THE FIRST QUARTER IN

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:04.624
WHICH IT WAS ADOPTED. HOWEVER,

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:06.326
BECAUSE THE OIL PROCESS WAS

01:56:06.392 --> 01:56:08.628
DELAYED, THAT CREATED SOME

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:09.862
UNCERTAINTY. ARE WE GOING TO

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:11.964
CONSIDER THE FIRST QUARTER TO

01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:12.865
BE THE FIRST COMPLIANCE? IS ARE

01:56:12.932 --> 01:56:15.234
WE GOING TO CONSIDER THE SECOND

01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:15.735
QUARTER TO BE THE FIRST

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:16.769
COMPLIANCE? AND IT WASN'T

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:18.638
REALLY UNTIL JULY, AFTER THE

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:20.740
END OF JUNE WHEN OIL APPROVED

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:23.176
IT. AND WE MADE A PUBLIC

01:56:23.242 --> 01:56:23.976
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE CONSIDERED

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:26.612
THE EFFECTIVE DATE JULY 1ST.

01:56:26.679 --> 01:56:28.548
AND SO THAT THE QUARTER

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:30.583
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT WOULD BE THE

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:32.518
FIRST QUARTER OF A COMPLIANCE

01:56:32.585 --> 01:56:34.754
OBLIGATION. SO OUR SPECULATION

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:37.423
AND WE CAN REALLY KIND OF ONLY

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:38.725
SPECULATE IS THAT THE COMPANIES

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.860
WERE SORT OF SEEING, YOU KNOW,

01:56:40.927 --> 01:56:42.128
THEY WERE UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHEN

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:43.663
IT WAS GOING TO START. THEY

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:44.797
WANTED TO KIND OF PLAN OUT

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:46.499
THEIR COMPLIANCE. AND SO THAT'S

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:49.302
WHY THEY ENGAGED IN SOME

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:50.937
COMPLIANCE ACTIVITY EARLIER IN

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:52.739
THE YEAR BEFORE IT ACTUALLY

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:54.707
WENT INTO EFFECT. ANYTHING TO

01:56:54.774 --> 01:56:56.509
ADD? CHEN? I JUST WANTED TO ADD

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:57.777
ON THIS ONE. JUST IF YOU SEE

01:56:57.844 --> 01:56:59.445
THE 2025 CHART, YOU CAN SEE

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:01.514
THAT IMPACT GO UP, BUT IT GETS

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.849
STABILIZED BACK DOWN. ONCE THAT

01:57:02.915 --> 01:57:03.916
CLARIFICATION WAS MADE, AND

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:06.252
THEN IT STARTS ACTUALLY GOING

01:57:06.319 --> 01:57:08.454
UP AGAIN WITH THE ACTUAL

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:11.224
COMPLIANCE DATE. BUT I WANT TO

01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:16.229
TALK ABOUT THAT JUST. JUST IF I

01:57:16.295 --> 01:57:19.499
MAY. AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONLY

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:21.667
IT'S ONLY A DATA POINT OR SET

01:57:21.734 --> 01:57:23.503
OF POINTS, BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:24.771
NOTICE. AND WHEN IT WAS POINTED

01:57:24.837 --> 01:57:26.439
OUT BY CHAIR WILSON ON SLIDE 11,

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:31.077
THIS INVERSE RELATIONSHIP THAT

01:57:31.144 --> 01:57:32.578

POINTS IS SHOWING IN THE PRICE

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:37.617
PER CREDIT VERSUS THE THE

01:57:37.683 --> 01:57:39.719
VOLUME OF CREDITS. AND SO I

01:57:39.786 --> 01:57:40.720
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING TO

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:42.755
NOTE. AND MAYBE YOU ALL MIGHT

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:44.891
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE AN OPINION.

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:45.658
BUT AS THE NEXT GROUP OF

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:46.826
SPEAKERS COME UP, CERTAINLY

01:57:46.893 --> 01:57:49.529
JUST INTERESTED IN AGAIN, IT'S

01:57:49.595 --> 01:57:52.665

GOING BACK ONLY A COUPLE OF

01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:56.169
YEARS. BUT BUT IT'S QUITE

01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:57.103
OBVIOUS SORT OF THE INVERSE

THE LCFS AND EQUIVALENTS THAT

YOU SEE IN OTHER STATES. IT IS

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:30.630
A COMPLEX PROGRAM. I THINK

ENVIRONMENTAL TERMS, IT'S

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:08.668
HELPFUL TO STEP BACK AND THINK

02:00:08.734 --> 02:00:10.770
OF WHAT THE ROLE OF THE LCF IS,

02:00:10.836 --> 02:00:13.472
THE LCFS IS, AND WHY WE HAVE IT,

02:00:13.539 --> 02:00:14.674
AND IT'S MEANT TO REDUCE

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:15.942
EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION

02:00:16.008 --> 02:00:17.743
FUELS AND SUPPORT THIS BROAD

02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:19.545
TRANSITION. AND PEOPLE IN THE

02:00:19.612 --> 02:00:20.780
PREVIOUS PANEL SORT OF TALKED

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:22.782
ABOUT HOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:23.516
THIS GENERALIZED PROGRESS

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:24.850
TOWARDS CLEAN TRANSPORTATION.

02:00:24.917 --> 02:00:26.452
AND I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:00:26.519 --> 02:00:27.620
RIGHT ABOUT THIS. BUT BECAUSE

02:00:27.687 --> 02:00:29.622
THE SCOPE IS SO BROAD, BECAUSE

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:30.990
IT'S MEANT TO GO AND LOOK AT

02:00:31.057 --> 02:00:31.624
MULTIPLE MODES OF

02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:32.625
TRANSPORTATION ON ROAD, OFF

02:00:32.692 --> 02:00:34.627
ROAD, THERE WAS SOME INTEREST

02:00:34.694 --> 02:00:35.561
IN EXTENDING IT TO AVIATION.

02:00:35.628 --> 02:00:37.630
THERE ARE HARBOR CRAFT WHOSE

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:39.732
FUELS ARE AFFECTED. THAT ADDS A

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:40.566
LOT OF COMPLEXITY. IT ALSO

02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:41.801
DEALS WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:43.803
FUEL TYPES. AND SO THAT SORT OF

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:46.172
REALLY EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF THE

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:48.374
REGULATION. AND IT CAN BE

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:49.976
CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE IDEA OF

02:00:50.042 --> 02:00:51.777
THE PROGRAM IS TO GIVE ALL

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:52.979
THESE FUELS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:55.114
ENGAGE AND TO CONTRIBUTE WHAT

02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:55.815
THEY CAN TOWARDS CALIFORNIA'S

02:00:55.881 --> 02:00:57.683
ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:58.584
THAT OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

02:00:58.651 --> 02:01:00.786
AND SO, I THINK ONE OF THE REAL

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:02.755
KEY ELEMENTS OF THE LCFS THAT

02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:03.723
HAS ENABLED IT TO BE SUCCESSFUL,

02:01:03.789 --> 02:01:05.725
AND THE CONSENSUS AMONG MOST

02:01:05.791 --> 02:01:07.393
ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCHERS IS

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.628
THAT IT HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL,

02:01:08.694 --> 02:01:09.762
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM TO DATE, IS

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:11.397
THE FACT THAT IT MAKES THE

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:12.632
INCENTIVE ANY FUEL RECEIVES

02:01:12.698 --> 02:01:13.766
PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:14.900
EMISSIONS BENEFIT IT PROVIDES.

02:01:14.967 --> 02:01:16.636
SO FUELS THAT ARE VERY CLEAN,

02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:18.638
THAT ARE A LOT CLEANER THAN THE

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:19.905
TARGET OR LOT CLEANER THAN

02:01:19.972 --> 02:01:20.539
PETROLEUM, RECEIVE A RELATIVELY

02:01:20.606 --> 02:01:21.774
LARGE AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE PER

02:01:21.841 --> 02:01:23.609
UNIT OF FUEL DELIVERED FUELS

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:25.411
THAT ARE SMALLER, YOU KNOW,

02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:26.712
CLEANER THAN THAN THE TARGET,

02:01:26.779 --> 02:01:28.814
BUT PERHAPS NOT QUITE SO CLEAN,

02:01:28.881 --> 02:01:29.615
RECEIVE A SMALLER INCENTIVE.

02:01:29.682 --> 02:01:31.517
AND THIS REALLY HELPS GUIDE

02:01:31.584 --> 02:01:32.718
INVESTMENT TOWARD THE FUELS

02:01:32.785 --> 02:01:33.619
THAT PROVIDE THE GREATEST

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:36.722
BENEFIT. AND AND SORT OF GIVE

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:38.491
US THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:40.593
BUCK THERE. IN ORDER TO BE

02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:43.062
EFFECTIVE AT THAT, YOU HAVE TO

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:43.629
HAVE A PROGRAM THAT IS VERY

02:01:43.696 --> 02:01:44.764
SCIENTIFICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:46.699
BASED, THAT REQUIRES A

02:01:46.766 --> 02:01:48.434
COMMITMENT TO ACCURATE LIFE

02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:49.702
CYCLE ASSESSMENT, LOOKING AT

02:01:49.769 --> 02:01:51.704
ALL THESE FUELS, UNDERSTANDING

02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:53.472
THE IMPACTS OF PROCURING RAW

02:01:53.539 --> 02:01:54.674
MATERIALS, CONVERTING THEM TO

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:55.875
FUEL, BRINGING THAT FUEL TO

02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:59.011
MARKET. AND PEOPLE OFTEN ASK,

02:01:59.078 --> 02:01:59.812
WELL, COULDN'T WE DO THE LCFS

02:01:59.879 --> 02:02:01.747
BUT SORT OF, YOU KNOW, HELP

02:02:01.814 --> 02:02:03.649
THIS FUEL A LITTLE MORE, THIS

02:02:03.716 --> 02:02:05.384
FEEL A LITTLE LESS? IT'S, YOU

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:06.419
KNOW, CONCEPTUALLY POSSIBLE TO

02:02:06.485 --> 02:02:07.820
DO THAT, BUT YOU START BREAKING

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:08.954
DOWN THIS STRONG RELATIONSHIP

02:02:09.021 --> 02:02:10.489
BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS

02:02:10.556 --> 02:02:12.591
BENEFIT AND THE AMOUNT OF

02:02:12.658 --> 02:02:14.126
INCENTIVE. AND THAT SORT OF

02:02:14.193 --> 02:02:15.594
COMPROMISES THE FUNCTION OF THE

02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:16.796
MARKET AND TAKES AWAY SOME OF

02:02:16.862 --> 02:02:18.898
ITS ABILITY TO SELF-CORRECT.

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:20.633
WHEN YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, EITHER

02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:22.635
AN EXCESS OR A SHORTAGE OF

02:02:22.702 --> 02:02:24.770
DEFICITS. I THINK IT'S ALSO TO

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:26.672
REALLY CONSIDER THIS SORT OF

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:27.740
MOMENT IN POLITICAL HISTORY

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:28.641
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE LCFS,

02:02:28.708 --> 02:02:30.710
AS YOU AND THE PREVIOUS PANEL

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:32.912
NOTED, MANY OF OUR AUTHORITIES

02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:34.747
TO ADOPT OUR OWN RULES AND

02:02:34.814 --> 02:02:35.881
TRANSPORTATION ARE UNDER ATTACK

02:02:35.948 --> 02:02:37.416
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN

02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:38.718
A WAY THAT I THINK IS VERY

02:02:38.784 --> 02:02:41.053
UNWISE, UNSCIENTIFIC, PROBABLY

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.388
ILLEGAL, THOUGH I'M NOT A

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:44.857
LAWYER, THE LCFS PERSISTS

02:02:44.924 --> 02:02:46.492
BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON SB 32

02:02:46.559 --> 02:02:47.727
AUTHORITY ON STATE LEVEL

02:02:47.793 --> 02:02:49.795
AUTHORITY, AND IT IS GOING TO

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:51.397
BE REQUIRED, AT LEAST IN THIS

02:02:51.464 --> 02:02:52.932
SORT OF INTERIM PERIOD. WHILE

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:54.700
WE ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:02:54.767 --> 02:02:55.501
THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE

02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:58.204
ATTACKS WILL SUCCEED AND WHAT

02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:58.804
CALIFORNIA WILL DO TO REPLACE

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:00.506
SOME OF THESE LOST AUTHORITIES,

02:03:00.573 --> 02:03:01.741
THE LCFS IS GOING TO HAVE TO

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:04.310
CARRY A SOMEWHAT LARGER BURDEN

02:03:04.376 --> 02:03:06.278
IN KEEPING UP THE MOMENTUM IN

02:03:06.345 --> 02:03:06.679
DECARBONIZING OUR

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:10.549
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO I

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:12.485
KNOW AS AS YOU YOURSELF HAVE

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:14.587
SAID, AFFORDABILITY IS A KEY

02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:16.722
ISSUE HERE AND SOMETHING THAT

02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:18.557
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. SO

02:03:18.624 --> 02:03:20.593
AS WAS MENTIONED BY SOME OF THE

02:03:20.659 --> 02:03:21.827
SPEAKERS IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL,

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:23.496
THE LCFS ADOPTS A MARKET BASED

02:03:23.562 --> 02:03:24.563
MECHANISM. THIS ALLOWS

02:03:24.630 --> 02:03:26.565
OBLIGATED PARTIES TO DECIDE HOW

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:28.901
THEY WANT TO COMPLY WITH THE

02:03:28.968 --> 02:03:29.902
REGULATIONS, WHAT SORT OF

02:03:29.969 --> 02:03:31.036
PORTFOLIO OF TECHNOLOGIES AND

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:32.671
FUELS THEY WANT IN ORDER TO

02:03:32.738 --> 02:03:35.407
MEET THE GOALS, AS WELL AS THE

02:03:35.474 --> 02:03:37.042
PRESENCE OF THE CREDIT MARKET

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:38.711
IN WHICH CREDITS ARE TRADED

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:40.412
LIKE STOCKS OR OTHER FINANCIAL

02:03:40.479 --> 02:03:41.947
INSTRUMENTS, GIVES THE

02:03:42.014 --> 02:03:43.682
OPPORTUNITY TO AGAIN PROCURE

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:45.451
LOW COST COMPLIANCE. AND AND SO

02:03:45.518 --> 02:03:47.019
MARKET BASED MECHANISMS LIKE

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:48.821
THIS HAVE A VERY STRONG BASIS

02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:50.689
IN BOTH SORT OF THE CONCEPTUAL

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:52.625
LITERATURE, AS WELL AS LOOKING

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:53.526
AT EXAMPLES OF EXISTING

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:54.660
PROGRAMS THAT USE THESE

02:03:54.727 --> 02:03:56.962
MECHANISMS AS BEING AN

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:57.763
EFFECTIVE WAY TO CONTROL THE

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.031
COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH

02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:01.000
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES LIKE THE

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:04.570
LCFS. THE THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT

02:04:04.637 --> 02:04:06.172
COIN IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS

02:04:06.238 --> 02:04:07.506
MARKET MECHANISM, IT IS MORE

02:04:07.573 --> 02:04:09.575
DIFFICULT TO PROJECT COMPLIANCE

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:10.910
COSTS FAR INTO THE FUTURE

02:04:10.976 --> 02:04:12.444
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:13.746
PORTFOLIO OF FUELS AND

02:04:13.813 --> 02:04:15.748
TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE USED TO

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:16.582
COMPLY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:18.651
PRICE THE LCFS CREDITS ARE

02:04:18.717 --> 02:04:19.852
GOING TO TRADE AT. THEY'RE

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:21.620
AGAIN, IT'S AN OPEN MARKET

02:04:21.687 --> 02:04:23.656
SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF OF

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:25.457
IMPULSES ON THAT. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:27.092
AGAIN, IT IS CONCEPTUALLY

02:04:27.159 --> 02:04:29.028
POSSIBLE TO DESIGN A PROGRAM

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:29.595
THAT WOULD GIVE YOU BETTER

02:04:29.662 --> 02:04:30.696
PREDICTABILITY IN THE FUTURE,

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:32.631
BUT YOU WOULD LOSE THE

02:04:32.698 --> 02:04:34.233
EFFICIENCY BENEFIT. YOU COULD

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.501
BETTER PREDICT THE PRICE, BUT

02:04:35.568 --> 02:04:36.769
WE PREDICT THAT THE PRICE WOULD

02:04:36.836 --> 02:04:39.104
BE HIGHER TO ACHIEVE THE SAME

02:04:39.171 --> 02:04:39.705
LEVEL OF BENEFIT. IF YOU, YOU

02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:41.740
KNOW, RADICALLY SCALE BACK AND

02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:43.375
WENT TO A MORE SORT OF DIRECT

02:04:43.442 --> 02:04:44.643
REGULATORY APPROACH AS OPPOSED

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:45.878
TO THE THE MARKET BASED

02:04:45.945 --> 02:04:48.514
APPROACH. ULTIMATELY, WHEN WE

02:04:48.581 --> 02:04:50.182
TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF

02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:51.817
WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE LCFS

02:04:51.884 --> 02:04:55.221
ON, YOU KNOW, RETAIL GASOLINE

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:56.956
PRICES, THE THE IMPACTS ARE

02:04:57.022 --> 02:04:57.990
DETERMINED BY THE

02:04:58.057 --> 02:04:59.625
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FUELS OR

02:04:59.692 --> 02:05:00.426
THE CARBON INTENSITY AND THE

02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:01.694
ENERGY DENSITY. THOSE ARE

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.629
ESSENTIALLY PHYSICAL CONSTANTS,

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:04.763
ESPECIALLY WHERE GASOLINE IS

02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.298
CONCERNED. SO THEY DON'T VARY

02:05:06.365 --> 02:05:07.700
MUCH. BUT THE PROGRAM TARGET

02:05:07.766 --> 02:05:09.668
VARIES. AND ESPECIALLY NOW WITH

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:10.536
THE AUTO ACCELERATION MECHANISM,

02:05:10.603 --> 02:05:11.871
IT BECOMES A BIT MORE UNCERTAIN

02:05:11.937 --> 02:05:13.739
TO PREDICT WHAT THE TARGET WILL

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:15.441
BE AS YOU GET FARTHER INTO THE

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:16.609
FUTURE. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE

02:05:16.675 --> 02:05:18.210
CREDIT PRICE. AND THAT VARIES

02:05:18.277 --> 02:05:19.845
QUITE A BIT. SO WHENEVER YOU

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:21.580
START TALKING ABOUT PRICE

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:23.249
IMPACTS THAT ARE MORE THAN A

02:05:23.315 --> 02:05:24.617
COUPLE QUARTERS AHEAD, YOU HAVE

02:05:24.683 --> 02:05:25.851
TO START MAKING ASSUMPTIONS

02:05:25.918 --> 02:05:27.386
ABOUT THAT PORTFOLIO OF FUELS

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:28.554
AND TECHNOLOGIES AND ABOUT

02:05:28.621 --> 02:05:30.589
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:31.790
CREDIT MARKET. AND SO AT SOME

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:33.959
POINT, YOU GET TO A SPOT WHERE

02:05:34.026 --> 02:05:34.627
YOUR FUTURE PROJECTIONS ARE

02:05:34.693 --> 02:05:35.828
MORE ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS YOU

02:05:35.895 --> 02:05:37.529
MAKE THAN THE UNDERLYING SORT

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:40.666
OF CRITERIA OF OF THE PROGRAM.

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:42.434
AS A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS IN THE

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:44.036
FIRST PANEL POINTED OUT, THE

02:05:44.103 --> 02:05:44.803
IMPACTS OF THE LCFS HAVE

02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:45.938
HISTORICALLY BEEN RELATIVELY

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:48.741
LOW ON ON RETAIL GAS PRICES,

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:50.376
SMALLER THAN THINGS LIKE NORMAL

02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:52.544
SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN GAS

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:54.713
PRICES, SMALLER THAN THE

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:55.514
TYPICAL FLUCTUATIONS YOU SEE

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:56.815
WHEN THERE'S A GEOPOLITICAL

02:05:56.882 --> 02:05:58.684
INSTABILITY THAT AFFECTS OIL

02:05:58.751 --> 02:05:59.485
SUPPLY OR WHEN THERE ARE

02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:01.620
UNPLANNED REFINERY OUTAGES. SO

02:06:01.687 --> 02:06:03.355
THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT ZERO, BUT

02:06:03.422 --> 02:06:05.691
THEY TEND TO BE LOW. AND WHERE

02:06:05.758 --> 02:06:07.626
WE HAVE DONE COST BENEFIT

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:08.594
ANALYSIS ON THESE, AND THAT HAS

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:10.529
BEEN, YOU KNOW, IN MULTIPLE

02:06:10.596 --> 02:06:11.797
WAYS, BOTH REGULATORY LEVELS OR

02:06:11.864 --> 02:06:13.532
PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS IN THE

02:06:13.599 --> 02:06:15.901
ACADEMIC LITERATURE. THE

02:06:15.968 --> 02:06:17.403
BENEFITS, YOU KNOW, TYPICALLY

02:06:17.469 --> 02:06:19.538
OUTWEIGH THE COSTS PRETTY

02:06:19.605 --> 02:06:20.940
SIGNIFICANTLY. THE OTHER THING

02:06:21.006 --> 02:06:23.475
TO REALIZE IS THE LCFS THE

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:24.810
REVENUE STAYS ENTIRELY WITHIN

02:06:24.877 --> 02:06:26.445
THE FUEL PRODUCTION SYSTEM. SO

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:29.048
WHEN A DEFICIT HOLDING ENTITY

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:30.716
LIKE A PETROLEUM PRODUCER BUYS

02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:32.518
A CREDIT, THEY BUY IT FROM THE

02:06:32.584 --> 02:06:33.652
CLEAN FUEL PRODUCER. IT IS A

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:35.487
DIRECT TRANSFER VIA A CONTRACT

02:06:35.554 --> 02:06:37.756
FOR SALE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR

02:06:37.823 --> 02:06:39.825
TO THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY

02:06:39.892 --> 02:06:40.359
LEAVING THE TRANSPORTATION

02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:41.694
SYSTEM. THERE'S NO FLOW OF

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:42.828
REVENUE OUT TO FUND OTHER

02:06:42.895 --> 02:06:44.863
PRIORITIES. SO YOU'RE NOT SORT

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:46.865
OF TAKING FUEL MONEY AND USING

02:06:46.932 --> 02:06:47.866
IT FOR OTHER NON TRANSPORTATION

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:49.468
THINGS. IT IS SIMPLY

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:51.036
REALLOCATING COSTS WITHIN THE

02:06:51.103 --> 02:06:52.705
TRANSPORTATION FUEL POOL. SO

02:06:52.771 --> 02:06:54.473
DIRTY FUELS BECOME MORE

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:55.774
EXPENSIVE, CLEAN FUELS BECOME

02:06:55.841 --> 02:06:58.077
CHEAPER. AND THAT HELPS

02:06:58.143 --> 02:06:58.811
ESTABLISH CONSUMER PREFERENCES.

02:06:58.877 --> 02:07:00.813
ALSO AS MORE PEOPLE ADOPT

02:07:00.879 --> 02:07:02.781
THINGS LIKE ELECTRIC VEHICLES

02:07:02.848 --> 02:07:04.550
OR SWITCH TO USING CLEAN FUELS,

02:07:04.616 --> 02:07:05.751
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:07.486
USING PETROLEUM DECLINES. SO

02:07:07.553 --> 02:07:08.921
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPOSED TO

02:07:08.988 --> 02:07:10.656
THE PRICE INCREASES THAT THE

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:12.524
LCFS PUTS ON HYDROCARBON FUELS

02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:14.560
DECREASES OVER TIME. SO YOU

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:16.228
HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT IN THE

02:07:16.295 --> 02:07:17.463
CONTEXT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:07:17.529 --> 02:07:18.797
ABOUT GAS PRICE INCREASES, IS

02:07:18.864 --> 02:07:21.266
THAT, YOU KNOW, IT AFFECTS AN

02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:22.801
EVER DECREASING SHARE OF THE

02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:25.437
CALIFORNIA POPULATION. WHEN WE

02:07:25.504 --> 02:07:26.772
ESTIMATE GAS PRICE IMPACTS. AND

02:07:26.839 --> 02:07:29.108
WE'VE HEARD A FEW OF THEM OUT

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:31.477
HERE, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE USE THE

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:32.978
PREVAILING METHODOLOGY, AND

02:07:33.045 --> 02:07:33.946
THIS INCLUDES THE ONES THAT

02:07:34.013 --> 02:07:35.881
HAVE ORIGINATED FROM ME AND

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:36.882
SEVERAL OF MY IMPACTS HAVE SORT

02:07:36.949 --> 02:07:38.450
OF MADE THEIR ROUNDS THROUGH

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:39.885
THROUGH MEDIA AND STORIES OR IN

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:40.786
CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS.

02:07:40.853 --> 02:07:42.821
THOSE ESTIMATES ARE LIKELY TO

02:07:42.888 --> 02:07:44.857
BE OVERESTIMATES OF THE ACTUAL

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:45.891
COSTS TO THE OBLIGATED PARTIES.

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:48.460
AND THIS IS AS WAS MENTIONED IN

02:07:48.527 --> 02:07:50.729
THE PREVIOUS SESSION. PARTIES

02:07:50.796 --> 02:07:52.698
HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR HOW

02:07:52.765 --> 02:07:53.699
THEY CHOOSE TO COMPLY WITH THE

02:07:53.766 --> 02:07:54.900
REGULATION. THE ASSUMPTION THAT

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:56.935
WE MAKE WHEN WE MAKE THESE

02:07:57.002 --> 02:07:58.937
ESTIMATES IS WE'RE GOING TO

02:07:59.004 --> 02:07:59.938
LOOK AT HOW MANY DEFICITS PER

02:08:00.005 --> 02:08:01.473
GALLON OF RETAIL GASOLINE ARE

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:02.741
GENERATED BASED ON THE TARGET

02:08:02.808 --> 02:08:04.977
AND THE FUEL CHARACTERISTICS.

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:06.478
AND THEN HOW MANY CREDITS DO

02:08:06.545 --> 02:08:07.713
YOU HAVE TO BUY AT THE

02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:08.747
PREVAILING MARKET PRICE AND

02:08:08.814 --> 02:08:10.482
SORT OF PLUG THOSE NUMBERS IN.

02:08:10.549 --> 02:08:11.650
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET YOUR

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:13.752
CENTS PER GALLON ESTIMATE. WELL,

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:14.920
COMPANIES CAN SELF GENERATE

02:08:14.987 --> 02:08:15.888
CREDITS THROUGH PROJECT BASED

02:08:15.954 --> 02:08:17.022
CREDITING PATHWAYS. THEY CAN

02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:18.824
ENGAGE IN LONG TERM OFFTAKE

02:08:18.891 --> 02:08:20.592
AGREEMENTS WHERE THEY AGREE TO

02:08:20.659 --> 02:08:22.661
BUY FOR MANY YEARS AT A LOWER

02:08:22.728 --> 02:08:24.463
PRICE. THEY CAN AND OFTEN DO

02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:25.664
TAKE OWNERSHIP STAKES IN CREDIT

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:26.799
GENERATING COMPANIES, WHETHER

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.400
THOSE ARE BIOFUEL COMPANIES OR

02:08:28.467 --> 02:08:29.768
EV CHARGING COMPANIES, AND

02:08:29.835 --> 02:08:31.737
PRODUCE THEIR OWN CREDITS THAT

02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:33.472
THEY DON'T NEED TO BUY. THAT

02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:34.706
THE PRICE IS NEVER ACTUALLY

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:35.874
MIGHT NOT GET REPORTED IN THE

02:08:35.941 --> 02:08:37.476
SAME WAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO

02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:38.077
TRANSACTION. THEY'RE PRODUCING

02:08:38.143 --> 02:08:40.212
THEIR OWN CREDITS WITHIN THE

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:41.413
SAME CORPORATE ENTITY FROM AN

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.681
ECONOMIC SORT OF CONCEPTUAL

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:43.782
ECONOMIC STANDPOINT. THERE'S NO

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:45.684
REASON TO DO THIS UNLESS YOU

02:08:45.751 --> 02:08:46.485
WOULD FIND LOWER COMPLIANCE

02:08:46.552 --> 02:08:48.587
COSTS THAT WAY. SO THIS IS WHY

02:08:48.654 --> 02:08:49.788
ALL THOSE ESTIMATES ARE I WOULD

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:52.091
VIEW THEM AS HIGH BOUND

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:52.724
ESTIMATES, THE SORT OF MAXIMUM

02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:54.460
THEORETICAL PRICE INCREASE. THE

02:08:54.526 --> 02:08:55.761
ACTUAL IS SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN

02:08:55.828 --> 02:08:58.997
THAT. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

02:08:59.064 --> 02:08:59.498
LOWER WITHOUT ACCESS TO

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:00.132
PROPRIETARY COMPANY INFORMATION

02:09:00.199 --> 02:09:03.735
THOUGH. I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN

02:09:03.802 --> 02:09:04.436
SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:09:04.503 --> 02:09:05.938
IN-STATE VERSUS OUT-OF-STATE

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:07.739
BENEFITS. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE

02:09:07.806 --> 02:09:08.941
MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE

02:09:09.007 --> 02:09:10.776
HERE IS THE LCFS IS PRIMARILY A

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:11.877
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION POLICY,

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:13.612
AND GREENHOUSE GASES ARE GLOBAL

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:15.581
POLLUTANTS. SO THE BENEFITS TO

02:09:15.647 --> 02:09:16.782
CALIFORNIA FROM REDUCING A TON

02:09:16.849 --> 02:09:18.851
OF GHG IS, YOU KNOW,

02:09:18.917 --> 02:09:19.618
ESSENTIALLY INDEPENDENT OF

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:22.321
WHERE THAT REDUCTION HAPPENS TO,

02:09:22.387 --> 02:09:24.089
TO OCCUR FOR MANY OF THE

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:25.691
CO-BENEFITS WE CARE MOST ABOUT,

02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:27.426
ESPECIALLY THE AIR QUALITY

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:28.560
CO-BENEFITS, THOSE PRIMARILY

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:29.695
OCCUR WHERE THE FUEL IS

02:09:29.761 --> 02:09:30.829
CONSUMED. AND THAT IS

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:31.563
OVERWHELMINGLY WITHIN

02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:33.565
CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE THE LCFS

02:09:33.632 --> 02:09:34.800
ONLY GRANTS CREDITS TO FUELS

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:35.934
THAT ARE SOLD INTO THE

02:09:36.001 --> 02:09:37.703
CALIFORNIA MARKET. WE HAVE,

02:09:37.769 --> 02:09:39.738
MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES AT UC

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:40.639
DAVIS HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF

02:09:40.706 --> 02:09:43.008
STUDIES LOOKING AT AIR QUALITY

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:43.675
IMPACTS OF PROGRAMS LIKE THE

02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:45.043
LCFS, BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:46.612
OREGON. WE FIND THAT IN

02:09:46.678 --> 02:09:49.815
ADDITION TO SORT OF GENERAL

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:50.582
STATEWIDE IMPROVEMENTS IN AIR

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:53.085
QUALITY, YOU ALSO SEE A

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:53.719
REDUCTION IN THE DISPARITIES OF

02:09:53.785 --> 02:09:56.655
AIR POLLUTANT EXPOSURE. AND

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:58.423
THESE DISPARITIES ON ON BOTH

02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:59.725
RACIAL AND INCOME BASED LINES.

02:09:59.791 --> 02:10:02.394
SO THIS IS TO SAY, WE KNOW THAT

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:03.629
LOWER INCOME PEOPLE AND

02:10:03.695 --> 02:10:05.631
NONWHITE PEOPLE ARE TYPICALLY

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:06.431
EXPOSED TO AIR POLLUTION AT

02:10:06.498 --> 02:10:08.534
HIGHER RATES BECAUSE OF SORT OF

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:11.036
HISTORICAL CHOICES MADE IN THE

02:10:11.103 --> 02:10:11.837
ENERGY SYSTEM, PROGRAMS LIKE

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:13.572
THE LCFS AND THE SORT OF

02:10:13.639 --> 02:10:14.773
PORTFOLIO OF POLICIES THAT IT

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:16.441
CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCE THOSE

02:10:16.508 --> 02:10:17.643
DISPARITIES. THEY HAVE A NET

02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:19.645
EQUITY ENHANCING OR EJ

02:10:19.711 --> 02:10:20.546
ENHANCING EFFECT. THEY DO NOT

02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:22.781
REDUCE IT TO ZERO, TO BE CLEAR,

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:23.882
BUT THEY DO REDUCE THE

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:26.485
DISPARITIES AS WE SEE THEM. SO

02:10:26.552 --> 02:10:28.654
QUESTIONS ARE OFTEN ASKED, WELL,

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:29.821
COULDN'T WE DO SOMETHING LIKE

02:10:29.888 --> 02:10:30.722
THE LCFS BUT LIMIT CREDIT

02:10:30.789 --> 02:10:31.823
GENERATION TO ONLY ENTITIES

02:10:31.890 --> 02:10:34.092
WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:35.627
AS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE

02:10:35.694 --> 02:10:36.895
BACKGROUND MATERIALS THAT CAME

02:10:36.962 --> 02:10:38.397
OUT BEFORE THIS HEARING? I

02:10:38.463 --> 02:10:39.498
THINK THAT WOULD LIKELY RUN

02:10:39.565 --> 02:10:40.866
AFOUL OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE

02:10:40.933 --> 02:10:42.801
AND OPEN THE PROGRAM TO A LEGAL

02:10:42.868 --> 02:10:43.936
CHALLENGE. IT WOULD ALSO, YOU

02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:45.604
KNOW, DISRUPT THE COST

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:47.439
MINIMIZATION EFFORTS. THAT OR

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:48.073
THE COST MINIMIZATION POTENTIAL

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:49.675
YOU HAVE BY BEING ABLE TO FIND

02:10:49.741 --> 02:10:52.010
LOW COST COMPLIANCE OPTIONS OUT

02:10:52.077 --> 02:10:54.079
THERE. IT'S DIFFICULT TO

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:55.781
PRECISELY ESTIMATE THE SORT OF

02:10:55.847 --> 02:10:57.149
IN-STATE VERSUS OUT-OF-STATE

02:10:57.216 --> 02:10:58.584
BREAKDOWN. I WILL SAY THAT IN

02:10:58.650 --> 02:11:00.752
THE PAST, CARB DID PUBLISH A

02:11:00.819 --> 02:11:01.920
SPREADSHEET THAT LOOKED AT

02:11:01.987 --> 02:11:03.956
GENERATION OF CREDITS BY

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:06.024
IN-STATE ENTITIES. THIS WAS, I

02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:07.993
BELIEVE, PRE-PANDEMIC TIME. SO

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.062
IT'S BEEN A WHILE. THIS WAS

02:11:10.128 --> 02:11:10.929
THEM GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND

02:11:10.996 --> 02:11:11.563
TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS. AND

02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:13.632
THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:14.666
THIS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

02:11:14.733 --> 02:11:16.935
DOES NOT MEAN THERE SORT OF

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:17.769
ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH. HAVING

02:11:17.836 --> 02:11:19.304
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN, I

02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:20.639
THINK WOULD BE USEFUL AND SHED

02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:22.674
SOME LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE. BUT,

02:11:22.741 --> 02:11:24.009
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE LEGITIMATE

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:26.578
CONCERNS ABOUT PROPRIETARY DATA

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:29.514
THAT HAVE TO BE RESPECTED HERE.

02:11:29.581 --> 02:11:31.750
SEVERAL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

02:11:31.817 --> 02:11:32.684
CAME IN TALKED ABOUT INDIRECT

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:35.621
LAND USE CHANGE, WHICH IS ITS

02:11:35.687 --> 02:11:36.855
OWN DEEP, COMPLEX KETTLE OF

02:11:36.922 --> 02:11:38.657
FISH THAT, YOU KNOW, AN ENTIRE

02:11:38.724 --> 02:11:40.659
HEARING WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO

02:11:40.726 --> 02:11:41.893
REALLY GET TO THE TO THE BOTTOM

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:44.630
TWO. THE SHORT, SHORT VERSION

02:11:44.696 --> 02:11:46.265
IS INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGE

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:47.466
EMISSIONS FROM BIOFUELS RESULT

02:11:47.532 --> 02:11:49.201
WHEN YOU HAVE AN INCREASED

02:11:49.268 --> 02:11:49.901
DEMAND FOR AGRICULTURAL

02:11:49.968 --> 02:11:50.969
COMMODITIES, THINGS LIKE

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:52.738
SOYBEAN OIL OR CORN OR ANYTHING

02:11:52.804 --> 02:11:54.573
THAT GOES INTO MAKING A BIOFUEL,

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.675
THAT DEMAND INDUCES SOMEONE,

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:59.011
SOMEWHERE TO CLEAR MORE LAND,

02:11:59.077 --> 02:12:00.612
TO BRING MORE PRODUCTION ONLINE,

02:12:00.679 --> 02:12:02.814
TO MEET THIS UNMET DEMAND. AND

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:04.516
SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT

02:12:04.583 --> 02:12:06.952
THE SPECIFIC COMMODITIES THAT

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:07.886
ARE GOING INTO OUR BIOFUELS ARE

02:12:07.953 --> 02:12:10.522
A PROBLEM, BUT IT'S BECAUSE WE

02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:11.690
ARE USING THESE COMMODITIES FOR

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:12.591
MAKING BIOFUELS SOMEWHERE.

02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:14.693
THERE IS A MOUTH NOT BEING FED.

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:16.795
THERE IS, YOU KNOW, A LOSS OF

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:18.563
THE CORN OR LOSS OF SOYBEAN OIL

02:12:18.630 --> 02:12:19.798
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT HAS

02:12:19.865 --> 02:12:21.867
TO BE REPLACED AND THE ACTIVITY

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:22.501
NEEDED TO REPLACE THAT

02:12:22.567 --> 02:12:24.102
PRODUCTION HAS EMISSIONS

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:25.771
CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU NEED TO

02:12:25.837 --> 02:12:27.506
BE AWARE OF AS YOU EVALUATE THE

02:12:27.572 --> 02:12:30.709
CARBON INTENSITY OF FUELS. SO

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.611
YOU CANNOT MEASURE ILUC

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:34.713
DIRECTLY. YOU COULD YOU COULD

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:35.881
GIVE ME ALL THE TECHNOLOGY THEY

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:37.416
HAVE IN STAR TREK AND AN

02:12:37.482 --> 02:12:38.483
UNLIMITED BUDGET. I COULD NOT

02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:39.851
BUILD YOU AN ELUXE SENSOR. IT

02:12:39.918 --> 02:12:41.420
IS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AT A

02:12:41.486 --> 02:12:42.921
CONCEPTUAL LEVEL. IT CAN ONLY

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:43.889
BE ASSESSED THROUGH MODELING

02:12:43.955 --> 02:12:45.724
AND MODELS HAVE TO CONSIDER THE

02:12:45.791 --> 02:12:46.458
ENTIRE GLOBAL AGRICULTURAL

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:47.559
COMMODITY SYSTEM, WHICH IS TO

02:12:47.626 --> 02:12:49.828
SAY THEY ARE VERY, VERY COMPLEX.

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:51.530
THERE IS NO WAY TO BUILD MODELS

02:12:51.596 --> 02:12:52.731
LIKE THIS WITHOUT ADOPTING A

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:54.032
NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS. THERE'S

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:56.568
OFTEN NO ONE AND ONLY ONE RIGHT

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:57.736
WAY TO TO MAKE THESE

02:12:57.803 --> 02:12:59.771
ASSUMPTIONS. AS YOU GO INTO

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:01.673
THIS. SO YOU, YOU END UP HAVING

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:03.375
VERY THICK, COMPLEX MODELS THAT

02:13:03.442 --> 02:13:04.609
CAN PROVIDE A LOT OF GUIDANCE

02:13:04.676 --> 02:13:06.712
WHEN DONE WELL. BUT THEY DON'T.

02:13:06.778 --> 02:13:08.480
THE IDEA OF HAVING ONE MODEL TO

02:13:08.547 --> 02:13:10.582
TELL YOU PRECISELY TO A DECIMAL

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:11.717
POINT WHAT THE RIGHT ILUC

02:13:11.783 --> 02:13:13.552
IMPACT IS, THAT IS SIMPLY NOT

02:13:13.618 --> 02:13:15.687
NOT POSSIBLE. THE OTHER THING

02:13:15.754 --> 02:13:17.556
IS THE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

02:13:17.622 --> 02:13:18.857
GLOBAL AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:20.592
SYSTEM, IT IS AFFECTED BY

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:21.526
GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS, ECONOMIC

02:13:21.593 --> 02:13:23.895
CHANGES, CLIMATE CHANGE,

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:24.529
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:25.831
CHANGES, ILUC IMPACTS NATURALLY

02:13:25.897 --> 02:13:27.632
CHANGE OVER TIME. THEY ARE NOT

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:30.736
GOING TO BE STATIC. THERE'S

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:31.703
SORT OF NO WAY THEY THEY COULD

02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:33.839
BE STATIC. SO AS A RESULT, THE

02:13:33.905 --> 02:13:35.374
THE ILUC IMPACT FACTORS THAT

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.642
WERE ADOPTED BY CARB IN 2016,

02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:39.845
THEY REPRESENT A FULL FAITH

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:41.513
EFFORT TO DO AS BEST AS

02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:42.714
POSSIBLE WITH THE TOOLS WE HAD

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:45.183
AT THE TIME. THEY ARE OUT OF

02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:46.551
DATE AND THEY DO NOT REFLECT

02:13:46.618 --> 02:13:47.652
THE CURRENT SITUATION FOR A

02:13:47.719 --> 02:13:49.388
NUMBER OF REASONS. I THINK IT'S

02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:50.622
MORE LIKELY THAT THEY ARE AN

02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:51.823
UNDERESTIMATE OF ILUC IMPACT

02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:53.525
THAN AN OVERESTIMATE, BUT WE

02:13:53.592 --> 02:13:54.760
CAN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:56.795
THAT IT COULD BE THE OTHER WAY

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:59.498
WITHOUT DOING A LOT OF WORK.

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:00.766
IMPROVING UPON THIS IS NOT A

02:14:00.832 --> 02:14:02.534
SIMPLE THING. THERE HAS BEEN A

02:14:02.601 --> 02:14:04.503
RELATIVE, YOU KNOW, LOW LEVEL

02:14:04.569 --> 02:14:05.837
OF INVESTMENT IN ILUC MODELING

02:14:05.904 --> 02:14:07.439
AND RESEARCH OVER THE LAST TEN

02:14:07.506 --> 02:14:09.574
YEARS. SO OUR TOOLKIT IS NOT AS

02:14:09.641 --> 02:14:10.909
ROBUST AS WE'D LIKE. I WILL SAY,

02:14:10.976 --> 02:14:12.544
MY COLLEAGUES AT UC DAVIS

02:14:12.611 --> 02:14:13.779
RECENTLY SECURED SOME FUNDING

02:14:13.845 --> 02:14:15.680
TO DO A MULTI-YEAR PROJECT TO

02:14:15.747 --> 02:14:16.581
AT LEAST DIG INTO ONE PART OF

02:14:16.648 --> 02:14:18.784
THIS. IT IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE

02:14:18.850 --> 02:14:19.951
THE PROBLEM, EVEN OUR WILDEST

02:14:20.018 --> 02:14:21.486
FANTASIES, BUT IT IS GOING TO

02:14:21.553 --> 02:14:22.921
HELP. I THINK MORE RESEARCH AND

02:14:22.988 --> 02:14:24.389
MORE INVESTMENT HERE NEEDS TO

02:14:24.456 --> 02:14:25.524
HAPPEN, BECAUSE THE THE

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:27.058
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ILUC CAN BE

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:29.461
VERY SEVERE IF IF YOU YOU GET

02:14:29.528 --> 02:14:30.762
IT WRONG. I DON'T THINK WE'RE

02:14:30.829 --> 02:14:32.998
WE'RE DOING THAT BAD IN

02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:34.466
CALIFORNIA YET. BUT IT IS THE

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.568
CONCERN IS QUITE LEGITIMATE.

02:14:36.635 --> 02:14:39.471
AND THEN ONE LAST THING I

02:14:39.538 --> 02:14:41.673
WANTED TO BRING UP IS THAT THE

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:43.909
RULEMAKING THAT WAS COMPLETED

02:14:43.975 --> 02:14:46.678
IN IN NOVEMBER, WHERE THE RULE

02:14:46.745 --> 02:14:47.913
WAS ADOPTED AND THAT CAME INTO

02:14:47.979 --> 02:14:50.582
EFFECT IN LAST MONTH. IT WAS,

02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:51.583
FROM THE START, MEANT TO BE

02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:54.019
VERY NARROW IN SCOPE, BECAUSE

02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:56.788
AT THE TIME, IN 2022, WHEN THE

02:14:56.855 --> 02:14:58.490
THE PROCESS, THE RULEMAKING

02:14:58.557 --> 02:14:59.825
PROCESS SPUN UP, WE WERE

02:14:59.891 --> 02:15:01.493
FOCUSED ON STABILIZING THE

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.562
CREDIT MARKET AND ENSURING

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:04.763
ADEQUATE INCENTIVES FOR LOW

02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:06.598
CARBON INVESTMENTS. AND SO MANY

02:15:06.665 --> 02:15:07.732
CRITICAL AREAS OF THE PROGRAM

02:15:07.799 --> 02:15:08.834
WERE BASICALLY SAID, WE'RE

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.769
GOING TO DECLARE THOSE OUT OF

02:15:10.836 --> 02:15:11.870
SCOPE FOR THIS RULEMAKING IN

02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:13.705
ORDER TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON

02:15:13.772 --> 02:15:15.540
THE THE URGENT ISSUE, YOU KNOW,

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:16.675
TAKING THE APPROACH OF FIRST

02:15:16.741 --> 02:15:19.044
PUT OUT THE FIRE, WHICH I THINK

02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:21.079
IS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA,

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:23.081
BUT THAT MEANT THAT THERE'S A

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:24.449
NUMBER OF AREAS IN THE LCFS

02:15:24.516 --> 02:15:26.818
WHERE THERE ARE NOW ASSUMPTIONS

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:28.820
THAT DATE BACK TO THE PROGRAM'S

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:29.955
ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION BACK IN

02:15:30.021 --> 02:15:32.824
2009, 2010. THAT MAKES THEM 15

02:15:32.891 --> 02:15:34.659
YEARS OR MORE OLDER. THINGS

02:15:34.726 --> 02:15:36.661
LIKE THE ENERGY ECONOMY RATIOS

02:15:36.728 --> 02:15:38.597
GOVERNING HOW MANY CREDITS EVS

02:15:38.663 --> 02:15:40.632
EARN RELATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL

02:15:40.699 --> 02:15:42.467
VEHICLES, ADDITIONALITY

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:43.902
STANDARDS, CHAIR RANDOLPH

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:44.703
DISCUSSED. THERE'S THERE IS NO

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:45.704
CONSISTENT ADDITIONALITY

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.539
STANDARD IN THE LCFS.

02:15:47.606 --> 02:15:48.540
ADDITIONALITY STANDARDS THAT

02:15:48.607 --> 02:15:49.741
ARE APPROPRIATE AT ONE POINT

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:51.142
MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOREVER,

02:15:51.209 --> 02:15:52.544
BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT THEY'RE

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:53.712
ASKING IS WHAT WOULD HAVE

02:15:53.778 --> 02:15:54.579
HAPPENED OTHERWISE, AND THAT

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:56.848
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION

02:15:56.915 --> 02:15:57.749
CHANGES OVER TIME. I LOOK AT

02:15:57.816 --> 02:15:59.451
RISK MITIGATION, AS I MENTIONED,

02:15:59.518 --> 02:16:01.586
THAT CHANGES OVER TIME.

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:02.721
ASSUMPTIONS ON FOSSIL FUEL

02:16:02.787 --> 02:16:03.522
DISPLACEMENT AND REBOUND

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:05.924
EFFECTS. SO THESE THINGS ARE

02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:07.726
NOT CAUSING A CRISIS RIGHT NOW,

02:16:07.792 --> 02:16:09.494
BUT THEY DO HAVE THE POTENTIAL

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:10.762
TO CAUSE A CRISIS IF THEY ARE

02:16:10.829 --> 02:16:12.464
NOT ADDRESSED AT SOME POINT IN

02:16:12.531 --> 02:16:13.632
THE FUTURE. THESE COULD BE

02:16:13.698 --> 02:16:15.600
THINGS WHERE IN FIVE YEARS THIS

02:16:15.667 --> 02:16:16.935
IS THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE TRYING

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:18.470
TO GO AND SORT OF PUT A

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:19.804
BAND-AID ON IN THE NEXT MAJOR

02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:21.373
RULEMAKING. AND SO I'VE BEEN

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:22.574
SAYING SINCE 2022, SINCE THE

02:16:22.641 --> 02:16:23.775
DECISION TO LIMIT THE SCOPE

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:25.644
THAT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,

02:16:25.710 --> 02:16:26.511
THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE

02:16:26.578 --> 02:16:27.646
ANOTHER RULEMAKING TO START

02:16:27.712 --> 02:16:28.747
DIGGING INTO THESE AND TO

02:16:28.813 --> 02:16:30.749
PREVENT THE FUTURE CRISIS. YOU

02:16:30.815 --> 02:16:31.583
CAN PREVENT THESE FUTURE CRISES

02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:33.084
WITH RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES

02:16:33.151 --> 02:16:34.753
TO THE PROGRAM, YOU KNOW, SORT

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:35.921
OF GRADUALLY BENDING THE CURVE

02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:36.721
AND AVOID THE NEED FOR

02:16:36.788 --> 02:16:39.057
PRECIPITOUS ACTION LATER. I

02:16:39.124 --> 02:16:40.392
KNOW THAT NOBODY IS EXACTLY

02:16:40.458 --> 02:16:42.561
RARING TO GO ON ANOTHER LCFS

02:16:42.627 --> 02:16:44.396
RULEMAKING RIGHT NOW. I THINK

02:16:44.462 --> 02:16:46.731
IT'D BE, YOU KNOW, ONE POSSIBLE

02:16:46.798 --> 02:16:48.700
OPTION WOULD BE IF YOU WANT TO

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:49.634
SAY THE THINGS THAT WERE JUST

02:16:49.701 --> 02:16:51.036
DECIDED IN LAST YEAR'S

02:16:51.102 --> 02:16:51.803
RULEMAKING ARE OUT OF SCOPE

02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:53.772
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:54.472
RELITIGATE THE WHOLE THING

02:16:54.539 --> 02:16:55.740
AGAIN. THAT MIGHT BE A WAY TO

02:16:55.807 --> 02:16:58.176
GET AROUND THIS, BUT THERE ARE

02:16:58.243 --> 02:16:58.777
SOME ISSUES WHERE WE NEED TO

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:00.979
START LOOKING AT THIS AND

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:01.746
CONFIGURING THE PROGRAM AS WE

02:17:01.813 --> 02:17:02.681
MOVE FROM THE EARLY PHASE OF

02:17:02.747 --> 02:17:04.950
THE CLIMATE TRANSITION INTO THE

02:17:05.016 --> 02:17:05.717
MIDDLE PHASE, WE THINK OF

02:17:05.784 --> 02:17:06.518
TECHNOLOGY KIND OF AS THE

02:17:06.585 --> 02:17:07.652
S-CURVE DEPLOYMENT. WELL, IN A

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:09.220
LOT OF WAYS, CERTAINLY

02:17:09.287 --> 02:17:09.854
TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA IS AT

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:11.456
THAT FIRST TURN GOING INTO THE

02:17:11.523 --> 02:17:13.592
RAPID CHANGE PHASE. AND SO

02:17:13.658 --> 02:17:14.759
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE PERFECTLY

02:17:14.826 --> 02:17:16.494
VALID 15 YEARS AGO DESERVE TO,

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:18.563
AT THE VERY LEAST, BE LOOKED AT

02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:19.798
AGAIN. AND I THINK THAT'S

02:17:19.864 --> 02:17:20.532
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:17:20.599 --> 02:17:22.667
DOING AS SOON AS AS PRACTICAL.

02:17:22.734 --> 02:17:25.537
WITH THAT, I WILL HAND IT OFF

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:26.504
TO, I THINK, AARON, YOU'RE NEXT.

02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:28.907
THANKS, COLIN. I'D LIKE TO

02:17:28.974 --> 02:17:30.475
THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:32.711
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND TO

02:17:32.777 --> 02:17:34.846
AND TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL. AND

02:17:34.913 --> 02:17:36.581
MY NAME IS AARON SMITH. I'M A

02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:38.316
PROFESSOR OF AGRICULTURAL AND

02:17:38.383 --> 02:17:39.818
RESOURCE ECONOMICS AT UC

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:41.753
BERKELEY. MY RESEARCH FOCUSES

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:43.655
ON MANY AREAS IN AGRICULTURE

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:45.991
AND ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,

02:17:46.057 --> 02:17:47.993
BUT IN PARTICULAR, I FOCUSED A

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:49.628
LOT ON BIOFUELS AND FUEL

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:52.030
POLICIES. SO I THINK THERE'S

02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:54.566
GOING TO BE SOME SLIDES UP HERE,

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:57.502
UP THERE, ANY MOMENT. THERE IT

02:17:57.569 --> 02:18:01.439
IS. SO I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT.

02:18:01.506 --> 02:18:05.010
THREE THINGS. AFFORDABILITY.

02:18:05.076 --> 02:18:07.712
AND IT IS TRUE THAT ANY PROGRAM

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:09.447
LIKE THE LCFS IS GOING TO

02:18:09.514 --> 02:18:10.548
INCREASE GAS PRICES. THE

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:12.751
QUESTION IS HOW MUCH. SO I WILL

02:18:12.817 --> 02:18:14.719
TALK ABOUT THAT. I'M GOING TO

02:18:14.786 --> 02:18:16.187
TALK ABOUT ADDITIONALITY. SO TO

02:18:16.254 --> 02:18:17.756
WHAT EXTENT DO WE THINK ABOUT

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:18.957
THE LCFS PAYING FOR THINGS THAT

02:18:19.024 --> 02:18:20.592
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY. AND

02:18:20.659 --> 02:18:22.661
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LAND USE

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.562
CHANGE. AND IN PARTICULAR, WE

02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:26.665
NEED A LOT MORE WORK IN THIS

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:29.501
AREA. I THINK CALIFORNIA IS AND

02:18:29.567 --> 02:18:30.702
SEES ITSELF AS A LEADER IN

02:18:30.769 --> 02:18:32.504
POLICY DESIGN. IN THIS AREA.

02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:33.805
YOU SEE MULTIPLE STATES NOW

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.607
WITH LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:36.808
AND PROPOSED LOW CARBON FUEL

02:18:36.875 --> 02:18:38.843
STANDARDS. PEOPLE COPY WHAT IS

02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:40.979
DONE HERE. AND SO GETTING THIS

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:43.515
RIGHT IS A VERY IMPORTANT. THE

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:46.484
WAY I THINK ABOUT THE LCFS IS A

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:48.720
LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS SEESAW

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:51.189
THAT I HAVE HERE. SO WHAT WE'RE

02:18:51.256 --> 02:18:52.524
DOING IS WE'RE BALANCING HIGH

02:18:52.590 --> 02:18:53.758
CARBON FUELS AGAINST LOW CARBON

02:18:53.825 --> 02:18:55.794
FUELS. AND WHAT THE LCFS

02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:58.730
REQUIRES IS THAT FOR EACH

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:00.665
GALLON OF GASOLINE AND DIESEL

02:19:00.732 --> 02:19:02.734
THAT WE'RE USING, WE'RE USING A

02:19:02.801 --> 02:19:03.968
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CLEAN FUELS

02:19:04.035 --> 02:19:06.571
TO KEEP THE THING IN BALANCE.

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:08.773
AND WHAT ONE THING THAT THAT

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.008
CARB DOES BY SETTING THE CARBON

02:19:10.075 --> 02:19:10.709
INTENSITY STANDARD IS MOVES

02:19:10.775 --> 02:19:12.777
THAT BALANCE POINT BACK AND

02:19:12.844 --> 02:19:16.648
FORTH. AND SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE

02:19:16.715 --> 02:19:18.717
IS MAYBE IF THE COLORED SQUARES

02:19:18.783 --> 02:19:20.685
ON THE RIGHT ARE DENOTING CLEAN

02:19:20.752 --> 02:19:23.488
FUELS, IF WE HAVE A FUEL THAT'S

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:24.689
REALLY, REALLY CLEAN, BUT WE

02:19:24.756 --> 02:19:26.524
DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH OF IT. BUT

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.560
IT'S WAY OUT THERE AT THE VERY

02:19:28.626 --> 02:19:29.861
END OF THE SEESAW, THEN THAT'S

02:19:29.928 --> 02:19:31.529
GOING TO HELP TO KEEP THINGS IN

02:19:31.596 --> 02:19:32.764
BALANCE A LOT FUELS THAT ARE

02:19:32.831 --> 02:19:34.833
NOT QUITE AS CLEAN, BUT WE USE

02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:37.001
A LOT OF ARE GOING TO BE CLOSER

02:19:37.068 --> 02:19:39.003
TO THE BALANCE POINT, BUT STILL

02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:40.171
WILL KEEP THINGS IN BALANCE

02:19:40.238 --> 02:19:42.574
OVER TIME. WHAT HAPPENS AS CARB

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:43.842
TIGHTENS THE CARBON INTENSITY

02:19:43.908 --> 02:19:45.944
STANDARD IS THAT BALANCE POINT

02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:46.845
MOVES TO THE RIGHT, RIGHT? SO

02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:48.747
IF YOU TOOK THAT LITTLE

02:19:48.813 --> 02:19:49.581
TRIANGLE AND MOVED IT TO THE

02:19:49.647 --> 02:19:51.549
RIGHT, THE THING WOULD TIP. SO

02:19:51.616 --> 02:19:52.884
YOU'D HAVE TO MOVE MORE STUFF

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:54.686
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. AND

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:55.587
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW THE

02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:56.688
PROGRAM WORKS. LOW CARBON FUELS

02:19:56.755 --> 02:19:58.423
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE

02:19:58.490 --> 02:20:00.625
GASOLINE AND DIESEL. THE FOSSIL

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:01.893
FUELS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. IF

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:03.528
THEY WEREN'T, WE WOULDN'T NEED

02:20:03.595 --> 02:20:05.697
A PROGRAM. AND SO WHAT THE

02:20:05.764 --> 02:20:07.832
PROGRAM DOES IS BY TRADING OF

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:10.068
THESE CREDITS, ESSENTIALLY IT'S

02:20:10.135 --> 02:20:10.902
IT'S OIL COMPANIES, THOSE THAT

02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:12.570
ARE PRODUCING FUELS ON THE LEFT

02:20:12.637 --> 02:20:14.706
HAND SIDE ARE BUYING CREDITS TO

02:20:14.773 --> 02:20:16.808
INCENTIVIZE THOSE ON THE RIGHT

02:20:16.875 --> 02:20:17.609
HAND SIDE TO MAKE IT

02:20:17.675 --> 02:20:18.576
ECONOMICALLY WORTHWHILE FOR

02:20:18.643 --> 02:20:20.512
THEM TO PROVIDE THOSE FUELS.

02:20:20.578 --> 02:20:22.947
THE CREDIT PRICE IS GOING TO BE

02:20:23.014 --> 02:20:24.716
DETERMINED IN THAT MARKET FOR

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:28.653
WHAT IS THE LOWEST COST. AS WE

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:29.487
HEARD FROM SEVERAL OTHER

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:30.989
PRESENTERS, THE LOWEST COST

02:20:31.055 --> 02:20:33.958
TYPE OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL THAT

02:20:34.025 --> 02:20:35.627
WE CAN BRING INTO THE SYSTEM.

02:20:35.693 --> 02:20:39.697
AND SO AND SO THOSE CREDIT

02:20:39.764 --> 02:20:41.666
PRICES ARE GOING TO CHANGE OVER

02:20:41.733 --> 02:20:42.901
TIME FOR FOR THAT FOR THAT

02:20:42.967 --> 02:20:44.569
REASON, DEPENDING ON WHAT IS

02:20:44.636 --> 02:20:45.904
THE SORT OF NEXT LOWEST COST

02:20:45.970 --> 02:20:48.673
FUEL THAT WE CAN BRING IN TO

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:50.775
THE SYSTEM. ONE THING I DO WANT

02:20:50.842 --> 02:20:52.844
TO POINT OUT HERE IS JUST IN

02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:53.945
GENERAL, WITH THESE KINDS OF

02:20:54.012 --> 02:20:54.946
POLICIES, POLICYMAKERS HAVE A

02:20:55.013 --> 02:20:56.447
CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY WANT TO

02:20:56.514 --> 02:20:58.516
TRY TO CONTROL THE QUANTITY OF

02:20:58.583 --> 02:20:59.684
CLEAN FUEL YOU'RE GETTING OR

02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:01.820
THE COST OF GETTING THAT FUEL.

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:03.588
AND SO IN THE LCFS, WHAT WE'RE

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:04.889
CHOOSING IS WE'RE CHOOSING

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:05.723
WHERE TO PUT THAT BALANCE POINT,

02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:07.725
WHAT'S GOING TO BE OUR BALANCE

02:21:07.792 --> 02:21:08.860
BETWEEN HOW MUCH OF THE HIGH

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:10.528
CARBON DIRTY FUELS AND HOW MUCH

02:21:10.595 --> 02:21:12.964
OF THE LOW CARBON CLEAN FUELS.

02:21:13.031 --> 02:21:13.698
ONCE WE'VE SET, THAT'S OUR

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:14.999
TARGET, THEN THE PRICE OF

02:21:15.066 --> 02:21:16.901
REACHING THAT WILL BE WHATEVER

02:21:16.968 --> 02:21:18.903
IT IS, RIGHT? AND CONVERSELY,

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:20.572
IF YOU SAID, WELL, I WANT TO

02:21:20.638 --> 02:21:22.640
SET A PRICE, I'M WILLING TO PAY

02:21:22.707 --> 02:21:24.475
$0.20 A GALLON TO TRY TO GET

02:21:24.542 --> 02:21:26.110
CLEANER FUELS, THEN YOU LOSE

02:21:26.177 --> 02:21:26.978
CONTROL OF HOW MUCH EMISSIONS

02:21:27.045 --> 02:21:28.446
REDUCTION YOU'RE GOING TO GET

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:29.681
BECAUSE YOU'VE CHOSEN THE PRICE

02:21:29.747 --> 02:21:31.916
YOU WANT TO PAY, AND YOU'LL GET

02:21:31.983 --> 02:21:32.951
WHATEVER YOU GET FOR THAT PRICE.

02:21:33.017 --> 02:21:35.086
SO IN TERMS OF THE LOW CARBON

02:21:35.153 --> 02:21:36.754
FUEL STANDARD, WE DON'T HAVE

02:21:36.821 --> 02:21:38.857
CONTROL OVER WHAT IS THE PRICE

02:21:38.923 --> 02:21:41.492
IMPACT OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:21:41.559 --> 02:21:43.695
GET. SO I'VE GOT SOME NUMBERS

02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:45.763
UP HERE ON THE SLIDE. BUT I

02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:46.598
THINK THE TWO THINGS WE WANT TO

02:21:46.664 --> 02:21:48.833
SAY TO, TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT

02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:50.902
THE EFFECT OF THE LOW CARBON

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:51.669
FUEL STANDARD ON GASOLINE

02:21:51.736 --> 02:21:52.737
PRICES IS UNCERTAIN BY DESIGN,

02:21:52.804 --> 02:21:54.739
BECAUSE WE'RE CHOOSING TO

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:55.673
CONTROL THE CARBON INTENSITY OF

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.709
THE FUEL. WE'RE CHOOSING NOT TO

02:21:57.775 --> 02:21:59.477
SET A SPECIFIC TAX THAT STAYS

02:21:59.544 --> 02:22:01.679
FIXED AND CONTROL THE PRICE

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:03.481
EFFECT. WHAT I'VE GOT IN THIS

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:04.716
TABLE THERE YOU CAN SEE THERE'S

02:22:04.782 --> 02:22:06.751
THREE ROWS. ONE IS IF THE LCFS

02:22:06.818 --> 02:22:08.820
CREDIT PRICE IS LOW, WHICH IS

02:22:08.887 --> 02:22:10.588
$30 PER TON, ONE IN THE MIDDLE

02:22:10.655 --> 02:22:11.890
IS $60 PER TON, WHICH IS ABOUT

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:14.158
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND

02:22:14.225 --> 02:22:15.560
THEN ON THE BOTTOM I HAVE $250

02:22:15.627 --> 02:22:17.528
A TON, WHICH IS SORT OF ABOUT

02:22:17.595 --> 02:22:18.563
WHAT THE MAXIMUM CARBON PRICE

02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:22.000
WOULD BE AND HOW MUCH WILL THIS

02:22:22.066 --> 02:22:24.636
POLICY RAISE GASOLINE PRICES? A

02:22:24.702 --> 02:22:25.970
VERY SIMPLE FORMULA THAT WILL

02:22:26.037 --> 02:22:27.639
TELL YOU THAT BASED ON HOW FAR

02:22:27.705 --> 02:22:29.641
AWAY EACH OF THOSE THINGS IS,

02:22:29.707 --> 02:22:30.508
FROM THE MIDDLE POINT ON THAT

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:32.543
LITTLE SEESAW THAT I, THAT I

02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:33.878
SHOWED AND OUR RESEARCH HAS

02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:35.747
SHOWN THAT THAT THAT FUEL

02:22:35.813 --> 02:22:36.614
COMPANIES TEND TO PASS THOSE

02:22:36.681 --> 02:22:39.717
COSTS THROUGH TO CONSUMERS. SO,

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:40.585
YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT A

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:42.520
POINT UNDER THE NEW REGULATION

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:45.590
IN 2025 WHERE I THINK I'VE GOT

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:46.758
$0.15 UP THERE. MAYBE IT'S

02:22:46.824 --> 02:22:48.726
SLIGHTLY BELOW THAT. THE CREDIT

02:22:48.793 --> 02:22:50.561
PRICE IS A LITTLE BIT BELOW 60

02:22:50.628 --> 02:22:52.463
AS BEING THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE

02:22:52.530 --> 02:22:53.898
ADDING TO GASOLINE PRICES

02:22:53.965 --> 02:22:55.900
THROUGH THE LOW CARBON FUEL

02:22:55.967 --> 02:22:57.902
STANDARD. AS WE CHANGE THE

02:22:57.969 --> 02:22:58.736
STANDARD AND MOVE THAT BALANCE

02:22:58.803 --> 02:23:01.139
POINT TO THE RIGHT, THEN THAT

02:23:01.205 --> 02:23:03.541
THOSE PRICE IMPACTS COULD GO UP

02:23:03.608 --> 02:23:05.643
IF THE LCFS CREDIT PRICE GOES

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:06.878
UP, IF IT BECOMES REALLY

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:07.545
EXPENSIVE TO FIND THAT NEXT

02:23:07.612 --> 02:23:09.714
UNIT OF RENEWABLE FUEL THAT WE

02:23:09.781 --> 02:23:11.382
WANT. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF

02:23:11.449 --> 02:23:12.650
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND WE STAY

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:14.953
WHERE WE ARE, THEN THE GAS

02:23:15.019 --> 02:23:15.687
PRICE EFFECTS ARE GOING TO BE

02:23:15.753 --> 02:23:16.554
RELATIVELY SMALL. WE HAD

02:23:16.621 --> 02:23:18.623
QUESTIONS EARLIER ABOUT THE LOW

02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:20.525
CARBON FUEL CREDIT PRICES,

02:23:20.591 --> 02:23:23.127
WHICH I'VE GOT A PLOT OF THERE

02:23:23.194 --> 02:23:25.430
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. MY

02:23:25.496 --> 02:23:26.764
VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE

02:23:26.831 --> 02:23:29.367
IS, AS WE WERE GETTING TO SORT

02:23:29.434 --> 02:23:31.569
OF 2019 OR SO WHEN THE PRICE

02:23:31.636 --> 02:23:32.904
SPIKED UP TO 2019. THAT REALLY

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:34.639
WAS A TIME WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:35.907
EASILY AVAILABLE ADDITIONAL

02:23:35.974 --> 02:23:37.909
SOURCES OF LOW CARBON FUEL TO

02:23:37.976 --> 02:23:39.610
BRING INTO THE SYSTEM. AND SO

02:23:39.677 --> 02:23:41.612
PRICES WENT UP VERY HIGH TO

02:23:41.679 --> 02:23:42.680
INCENTIVIZE ADDITIONAL THINGS

02:23:42.747 --> 02:23:44.482
TO COME IN. TWO THINGS IN

02:23:44.549 --> 02:23:45.717
PARTICULAR, I THINK, HAPPENED

02:23:45.783 --> 02:23:47.418
AT THAT POINT. WE GOT A LOT

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:48.586
MORE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS,

02:23:48.653 --> 02:23:50.588
PARTICULARLY FROM FROM

02:23:50.655 --> 02:23:51.456
ANAEROBIC DIGESTERS ON DAIRY

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:53.558
FARMS. WE GOT A LOT MORE

02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:54.792
RENEWABLE DIESEL, AND IT TAKES

02:23:54.859 --> 02:23:56.060
TIME TO BUILD THOSE FACILITIES.

02:23:56.127 --> 02:23:57.495
BUT ONCE THOSE PRODUCTION

02:23:57.562 --> 02:23:58.730
FACILITIES FOR PRODUCING

02:23:58.796 --> 02:24:00.531
RENEWABLE DIESEL AND BIOGAS

02:24:00.598 --> 02:24:03.601
CAME ONLINE, THEN WE HAD ALL

02:24:03.668 --> 02:24:05.236
THIS FUEL AVAILABLE AND IT CAME

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:06.938
INTO THE SYSTEM. AND SO WE

02:24:07.005 --> 02:24:08.072
DIDN'T NEED THOSE HIGH PRICES

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:09.707
TO INCENTIVIZE NEW INVESTMENT

02:24:09.774 --> 02:24:12.210
INTO THOSE THINGS. AND SO WE

02:24:12.276 --> 02:24:12.877
ENDED UP WITH CREDIT PRICES

02:24:12.944 --> 02:24:14.979
DROPPING DOWN TO ABOUT WHERE

02:24:15.046 --> 02:24:20.151
THEY ARE NOW. ADDITIONALITY. SO

02:24:20.218 --> 02:24:23.321
THE ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS

02:24:23.388 --> 02:24:25.957
IS WE HAVE A LOT OF POLICIES.

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:27.558
THE DIRECTED AT FUEL MARKETS,

02:24:27.625 --> 02:24:29.627
DIRECTED AT ENVIRONMENT, AT THE

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:31.662
ENVIRONMENT. AND MANY OF THEM

02:24:31.729 --> 02:24:32.730
ARE VERY, VERY COMPLICATED AND

02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:33.765
HARD TO UNDERSTAND. I'VE

02:24:33.831 --> 02:24:35.199
HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS PICTURE

02:24:35.266 --> 02:24:37.201
THREE. ONE IS THE FEDERAL

02:24:37.268 --> 02:24:37.835
RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD, WHICH

02:24:37.902 --> 02:24:39.670
SETS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

02:24:39.737 --> 02:24:41.039
VOLUME OF BIOFUELS THAT WE'RE

02:24:41.105 --> 02:24:43.541
GOING TO USE IN THE COUNTRY. WE

02:24:43.608 --> 02:24:44.742
ALSO HAVE CALIFORNIA CAP AND

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:46.444
TRADE, WHICH REGULATES CARBON

02:24:46.511 --> 02:24:48.579
EMISSIONS ACROSS MANY SECTORS

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:50.515
IN THE STATE. AND THE LCFS KIND

02:24:50.581 --> 02:24:52.917
OF SITS IN THE MIDDLE HERE.

02:24:52.984 --> 02:24:54.385
WE'RE REQUIRING A LOT OF

02:24:54.452 --> 02:24:56.487
BIOFUELS THROUGH THE LOW CARBON

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:57.655
FUEL STANDARD. THAT'S OUR

02:24:57.722 --> 02:24:58.790
OVERLAP WITH THE FEDERAL

02:24:58.856 --> 02:25:01.559
RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD. WE'RE

02:25:01.626 --> 02:25:02.593
BECAUSE WE'RE REGULATING

02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:04.262
TRANSPORTATION FUELS AND FOSSIL

02:25:04.328 --> 02:25:05.730
FUELS. WE'RE ALSO OVERLAPPING A

02:25:05.797 --> 02:25:07.765
LOT WITH THE CAP AND TRADE

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.634
PROGRAM. SO ONE WAY TO THINK

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:10.868
ABOUT WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR

02:25:10.935 --> 02:25:12.537
OUR MONEY. RIGHT. THOSE THOSE

02:25:12.603 --> 02:25:13.704
CENTS PER GALLON NUMBERS I HAD

02:25:13.771 --> 02:25:15.606
ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE, WHAT ARE

02:25:15.673 --> 02:25:16.874
WE ACTUALLY GETTING FOR THAT IS

02:25:16.941 --> 02:25:18.576
TO SAY, WELL, HOW BIG IS THAT

02:25:18.643 --> 02:25:19.844
LITTLE AREA DOWN THE BOTTOM?

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:20.978
THAT'S THE ADDITIONAL STUFF

02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:22.680
THAT WE WOULDN'T GET ANYWAY

02:25:22.747 --> 02:25:23.915
FROM THOSE FROM THOSE OTHER

02:25:23.981 --> 02:25:26.751
THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS. AND SO

02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:28.653
ONE WAY WE CAN LOOK AT THIS IS

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:30.688
WHAT I'VE SHOWN HERE IN THIS

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:33.224
PICTURE IS THIS IS THE

02:25:33.291 --> 02:25:35.827
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

02:25:35.893 --> 02:25:37.762
REDUCTIONS UNDER THE PROGRAM.

02:25:37.829 --> 02:25:39.764
AND I'M SORRY FOR THOSE WHO

02:25:39.831 --> 02:25:41.599
CAN'T QUITE READ I CAN'T QUITE

02:25:41.666 --> 02:25:42.767
READ MYSELF WHAT WHAT THE

02:25:42.834 --> 02:25:43.634
COLORS REPRESENT. BUT I WILL

02:25:43.701 --> 02:25:46.571
TELL YOU BECAUSE I REMEMBER THE

02:25:46.637 --> 02:25:48.840
SO ALL THAT I'M DOING THERE IS

02:25:48.906 --> 02:25:50.541
I'M JUST SAYING LET'S COMPARE

02:25:50.608 --> 02:25:52.410
THE FUELS THAT WE'RE USING AND

02:25:52.477 --> 02:25:54.879
HOW MANY CREDITS THAT THOSE ARE

02:25:54.946 --> 02:25:57.782
GENERATING RELATIVE TO.

02:25:57.849 --> 02:26:01.686
RELATIVE TO FOSSIL GASOLINE AND

02:26:01.752 --> 02:26:03.654
DIESEL. SO IN BLUE, WHAT WE

02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:05.723
HAVE IS WE HAVE BIOMASS BASED

02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:07.692
DIESEL. SO THE LARGEST CREDIT

02:26:07.759 --> 02:26:09.393
GENERATOR HAS BEEN BIOMASS

02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:11.762
BASED DIESEL. THE LIGHT BLUE IS

02:26:11.829 --> 02:26:12.930
GENERATION FROM CROPS. SO

02:26:12.997 --> 02:26:14.632
THAT'S PARTICULARLY FROM THINGS

02:26:14.699 --> 02:26:16.534
LIKE SOYBEAN OIL OR CANOLA OIL

02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:19.770
OR CORN OIL. THE DARKER BLUE IS

02:26:19.837 --> 02:26:21.472
GENERATION OF BIOMASS BASED

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:24.075
DIESEL FROM FROM TALLOW OR

02:26:24.142 --> 02:26:26.544
OTHER WASTE PRODUCTS. SO YOU

02:26:26.611 --> 02:26:28.679
USE COOKING OIL SO YOU GET MORE

02:26:28.746 --> 02:26:29.413
CREDITS WHEN YOU PRODUCE

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.848
BIOMASS BASED DIESEL FROM THOSE

02:26:30.915 --> 02:26:34.085
THINGS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:34.652
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S LATEST

02:26:34.719 --> 02:26:35.720
RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD

02:26:35.786 --> 02:26:37.989
REQUIREMENT, WHICH REQUIRES A

02:26:38.055 --> 02:26:39.724
LOT OF BIOMASS BASED DIESEL TO

02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:41.792
COME INTO THE SYSTEM. I WOULD

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:43.528
ARGUE THAT CALIFORNIA ISN'T

02:26:43.594 --> 02:26:45.596
CAUSING ANY ADDITIONAL BIOMASS

02:26:45.663 --> 02:26:47.431
BASED DIESEL TO BE PRODUCED AND

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:49.700
USED IN THE COUNTRY. WHAT IT

02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:51.569
MIGHT BE DOING IS MOVING

02:26:51.636 --> 02:26:52.670
BIOMASS BASED DIESEL OUT TO THE

02:26:52.737 --> 02:26:54.705
RIGHT A LITTLE MORE IN THAT

02:26:54.772 --> 02:26:56.574
SEESAW. IN OTHER WORDS, MAKING

02:26:56.641 --> 02:26:57.575
IT CLEANER BY USING MORE WASTE

02:26:57.642 --> 02:26:59.610
PRODUCTS AND MAYBE LESS SOYBEAN

02:26:59.677 --> 02:27:02.647
OIL. SO WE COULD SAY MAYBE ALL

02:27:02.713 --> 02:27:03.881
THAT LIGHT BLUE IS PROBABLY NOT

02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:05.950
ADDITIONAL AT ALL. WE'D GET IT

02:27:06.017 --> 02:27:07.118
ANYWAY IN THE COUNTRY,

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:08.219
SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, AND

02:27:08.286 --> 02:27:09.554
ALL THE LCFS IS DOING IS PAYING

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:11.589
TO BRING IT FROM WHEREVER IT'S

02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:12.723
PRODUCED, PERHAPS IN ONE OF THE

02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:14.125
GULF STATES INTO CALIFORNIA,

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:14.659
BUT NOT REALLY ANY

02:27:14.725 --> 02:27:15.826
ENVIRONMENTAL GAIN THAT DARK

02:27:15.893 --> 02:27:17.395
BLUE. WE'RE PROBABLY GETTING

02:27:17.461 --> 02:27:18.596
SOME OF THAT JUST BY VIRTUE OF

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:20.731
THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL

02:27:20.798 --> 02:27:22.366
PROGRAM DOESN'T REGULATE THE

02:27:22.433 --> 02:27:23.467
CARBON INTENSITY OR THE

02:27:23.534 --> 02:27:25.570
CLEANNESS OF THE FUEL. IT JUST

02:27:25.636 --> 02:27:27.405
SAYS, IS IT BIOMASS BASED

02:27:27.471 --> 02:27:29.941
DIESEL OR IS IT NOT ETHANOL?

02:27:30.007 --> 02:27:31.709
UNDER THE FEDERAL RENEWABLE

02:27:31.776 --> 02:27:32.510
FUEL STANDARD, PRETTY MUCH

02:27:32.577 --> 02:27:35.246
EVERY GALLON OF GASOLINE IN THE

02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:36.214
UNITED STATES IS 10% ETHANOL,

02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:37.715
90% GAS, FOSSIL GASOLINE. AND

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:39.684
THAT'S TRUE HERE, AND IT'S TRUE

02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:40.818
OUTSIDE THE STATE. SO AGAIN,

02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:41.786
THE LCFS IS NOT REALLY ADDING

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:43.521
ANYTHING THERE. I WOULD ARGUE

02:27:43.588 --> 02:27:45.489
EITHER. AND THAT'S THE BROWN

02:27:45.556 --> 02:27:48.025
DOWN THE BOTTOM IS ETHANOL. YOU

02:27:48.092 --> 02:27:48.926
COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT AGAIN

02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:50.461
THAT THE LCFS IS INCENTIVIZED,

02:27:50.528 --> 02:27:51.629
ETHANOL PLANTS TO CLEAN

02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:52.830
THEMSELVES UP A LITTLE BIT AND

02:27:52.897 --> 02:27:53.998
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON

02:27:54.065 --> 02:27:55.600
INTENSITY. SO THERE'S A LITTLE

02:27:55.666 --> 02:27:57.668
BIT OF THAT, THAT AREA IN THE

02:27:57.735 --> 02:27:58.869
BOTTOM THAT MIGHT REMAIN IF WE

02:27:58.936 --> 02:28:00.605
SAID, LET'S ONLY LOOK AT WHAT

02:28:00.671 --> 02:28:03.374
IS THE LCFS ACTUALLY ADDING.

02:28:03.441 --> 02:28:05.710
BIOGAS, I WOULD SAY I THINK IT

02:28:05.776 --> 02:28:07.645
I DON'T THINK IT'S DEBATABLE

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:08.579
THAT THE BUILD OUT THAT WE'VE

02:28:08.646 --> 02:28:09.947
HAD IN BIOGAS PRODUCTION, I

02:28:10.014 --> 02:28:11.682
THINK IT WOULD NOT HAVE

02:28:11.749 --> 02:28:12.750
HAPPENED WITHOUT THE LCFS,

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:13.718
BECAUSE THE LCFS GIVES BIG

02:28:13.784 --> 02:28:15.753
SUPPORT TO THOSE PRODUCERS. THE

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:18.055
LAST ONE IS ELECTRICITY, WHICH

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:20.758
I THINK I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:28:20.825 --> 02:28:22.560
OF ROOM FOR DEBATE. AND I THINK

02:28:22.627 --> 02:28:23.761
THE WAY THAT CARB IS DEALT WITH

02:28:23.828 --> 02:28:24.829
ELECTRICITY CREDITS HAS

02:28:24.895 --> 02:28:26.530
IMPROVED OVER TIME. THE MAIN

02:28:26.597 --> 02:28:28.532
MARGIN FOR INCENTIVIZING

02:28:28.599 --> 02:28:29.934
CHANGES IN FUEL USE FROM LIQUID

02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:31.535
FUELS TO ELECTRICITY, I THINK,

02:28:31.602 --> 02:28:33.137
IS IN INCENTIVIZING PURCHASE OF

02:28:33.204 --> 02:28:35.439
NEW VEHICLES. AND SO CREDIT

02:28:35.506 --> 02:28:36.741
HAVE FLOWED MORE IN THAT

02:28:36.807 --> 02:28:37.908
DIRECTION AND LESS TOWARDS JUST

02:28:37.975 --> 02:28:38.643
PEOPLE REDUCING THEIR

02:28:38.709 --> 02:28:40.444
ELECTRICITY BILLS OVER TIME,

02:28:40.511 --> 02:28:41.746
WHICH I THINK IS GOOD. BUT I

02:28:41.812 --> 02:28:43.881
THINK A FOCUS ON HOW MUCH HOW

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:45.783
MUCH IS THAT CREDIT GENERATION

02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:47.752
ACTUALLY CAUSING PEOPLE TO BUY

02:28:47.818 --> 02:28:48.586
EVS, RATHER THAN JUST GIVING

02:28:48.653 --> 02:28:49.720
MONEY TO PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT AN

02:28:49.787 --> 02:28:51.822
EV ANYWAY, IS AN OPEN QUESTION

02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:53.324
TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT THE

02:28:53.391 --> 02:28:54.959
ANSWER TO. SO BASED ON ALL OF

02:28:55.026 --> 02:28:56.727
THAT DISCUSSION THAT I KIND OF

02:28:56.794 --> 02:28:57.495
WENT THROUGH, ALL THAT STUFF

02:28:57.561 --> 02:28:58.663
THAT'S THERE IN WHITE ARE

02:28:58.729 --> 02:29:00.631
THINGS THAT I MIGHT ARGUE WE

02:29:00.698 --> 02:29:02.099
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN

02:29:02.166 --> 02:29:02.733
ANYWAY IN TERMS OF TOTAL CARBON

02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:04.635
EMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:06.937
AND THE LCFS. WHAT IT'S ADDING

02:29:07.004 --> 02:29:09.807
POTENTIALLY IS WE WOULDN'T HAVE

02:29:09.874 --> 02:29:10.608
GOTTEN BIOGAS, I DON'T THINK,

02:29:10.675 --> 02:29:12.643
WITHOUT THE THAT WE PERHAPS

02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:14.278
WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN, ALTHOUGH

02:29:14.345 --> 02:29:15.413
I THINK THAT'S ALSO DEBATABLE.

02:29:15.479 --> 02:29:17.214
WE PERHAPS WOULD NOT HAVE

02:29:17.281 --> 02:29:20.484
GOTTEN. THE WASTE FUELS USED IN

02:29:20.551 --> 02:29:21.686
RENEWABLE DIESEL THAT WE THAT

02:29:21.752 --> 02:29:23.421
WE'VE GOTTEN. WE PROBABLY I

02:29:23.487 --> 02:29:25.656
THINK THE LCFS IS MORE FOR

02:29:25.723 --> 02:29:26.824
ELECTRICITY THAN MAYBE MY

02:29:26.891 --> 02:29:28.893
PICTURE SHOWS. SO THIS IS MORE

02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:29.593
ILLUSTRATIVE THAN TO BE TAKEN

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:30.795
LITERALLY. BUT I THINK THERE'S

02:29:30.861 --> 02:29:33.431
A LOT OF COMPONENTS TO THE LCFS

02:29:33.497 --> 02:29:34.532
THAT ARE NOT ADDITIONAL BEYOND

02:29:34.598 --> 02:29:37.635
WHAT OTHER POLICIES DO. LAND

02:29:37.702 --> 02:29:39.603
USE CHANGES THE LAST THING. SO

02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:41.572
GROWING CROPS FOR BIOFUELS

02:29:41.639 --> 02:29:42.707
CAUSES CROPLAND EXPANSION. AND

02:29:42.773 --> 02:29:44.875
A LOT OF THE WAY THAT HAPPENS

02:29:44.942 --> 02:29:46.711
IS EXACTLY AS COLIN SAID, IT'S

02:29:46.777 --> 02:29:49.814
INDIRECT. AND SO WE'VE SORT OF

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.482
WENT THROUGH THIS DEBATE A

02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:52.717
DECADE AGO WITH ETHANOL WHEN

02:29:52.783 --> 02:29:54.819
CORN ETHANOL EXPANDED HUGELY,

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:56.987
MOSTLY DRIVEN BY THE FEDERAL

02:29:57.054 --> 02:29:59.724
PROGRAM. WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW

02:29:59.790 --> 02:30:01.492
IS A SIMILAR THING AS WE EXPAND

02:30:01.559 --> 02:30:03.127
RENEWABLE DIESEL PRODUCTION

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:04.662
FROM ANIMAL FATS AND VEGETABLE

02:30:04.729 --> 02:30:06.564
OILS, IN PARTICULAR FROM

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:07.765
VEGETABLE OILS. AND SO IF

02:30:07.832 --> 02:30:09.500
YOU'RE GOING TO BRING MORE IN

02:30:09.567 --> 02:30:10.668
THE UNITED STATES, PROBABLY

02:30:10.735 --> 02:30:13.771
SOYBEAN OIL, INTO BIOFUEL

02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:16.574
PRODUCTION AROUND THE WORLD FOR

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.442
COOKING PURPOSES, SOYBEAN OIL,

02:30:18.509 --> 02:30:21.645
CANOLA OIL, SUNFLOWER OIL, PALM

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:22.613
OIL, THEY'RE ALL PRETTY MUCH

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:23.681
SUBSTITUTABLE. THEIR PRICES

02:30:23.748 --> 02:30:24.949
MOVE TOGETHER. THEY'RE PRETTY

02:30:25.015 --> 02:30:26.617
MUCH THE SAME. THOSE PRODUCTS

02:30:26.684 --> 02:30:27.718
ARE PRETTY MUCH SUBSTITUTABLE.

02:30:27.785 --> 02:30:29.553
AND SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:30.721
IS INCENTIVIZE INCREASE IN

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:31.756
PRODUCTION OF THOSE PRODUCTS.

02:30:31.822 --> 02:30:32.256
AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY

02:30:32.323 --> 02:30:33.591
WORRISOME IF YOU'RE THINKING

02:30:33.657 --> 02:30:34.825
ABOUT CLIMATE IMPACTS, BECAUSE

02:30:34.892 --> 02:30:35.926
THE PLACES WHERE YOU MIGHT

02:30:35.993 --> 02:30:37.161
EXPAND SOYBEAN PRODUCTION WOULD

02:30:37.228 --> 02:30:40.431
BE IN BRAZIL BY BY DEFORESTING,

02:30:40.498 --> 02:30:41.632
THE PLACES WHERE YOU WOULD

02:30:41.699 --> 02:30:42.867
INCREASE PALM OIL PRODUCTION

02:30:42.933 --> 02:30:44.802
ARE IN INDONESIA, WHICH IS THE

02:30:44.869 --> 02:30:45.703
PICTURE THAT I'VE SHOWN THERE.

02:30:45.770 --> 02:30:47.605
SO IT'S TWO IT'S A PARTICULAR

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:48.839
PLOT OF LAND TWO YEARS APART.

02:30:48.906 --> 02:30:50.941
IT WAS FOREST IN 2014. IT'S

02:30:51.008 --> 02:30:52.543
PALM OIL PRODUCTION IN 2024. SO

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:54.545
IF YOU INCENTIVIZE INCREASED

02:30:54.612 --> 02:30:56.614
RENEWABLE DIESEL PRODUCTION BY

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:58.449
EXPANDING THE AMOUNT OF

02:30:58.516 --> 02:31:00.684
VEGETABLE OILS THAT WE'RE USING,

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:01.685
THAT RAISES THE PRICE OF

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:04.088
VEGETABLE OILS, THAT CAUSES

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:05.656
DEFORESTATION IN INDONESIA. AND

02:31:05.723 --> 02:31:06.991
YOU LOSE A LOT OF CARBON, RIGHT?

02:31:07.057 --> 02:31:08.626
THERE'S A LOT OF CARBON IN THE

02:31:08.692 --> 02:31:09.693
BIOMASS. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:12.430
CARBON IN THE PEAT. AND SO YOU

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:13.531
LOSE A LOT OF CARBON WHEN YOU

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:16.100
ARE WHEN YOU DEFOREST IN, IN,

02:31:16.167 --> 02:31:16.734
IN THOSE TROPICAL ENVIRONMENTS.

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:19.670
AND SO, SO ACCOUNTING FOR THIS,

02:31:19.737 --> 02:31:20.538
IF WE'RE TRYING TO USE THIS

02:31:20.604 --> 02:31:22.740
PROGRAM AS A WAY TO GET CLIMATE

02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:25.843
BENEFITS, WE REALLY NEED TO BE

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.578
CORRECTLY ACCOUNTING FOR

02:31:27.645 --> 02:31:28.412
WHETHER WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING

02:31:28.479 --> 02:31:29.780
CLIMATE GAINS OR WHETHER WE'RE

02:31:29.847 --> 02:31:32.917
NOT THE. SO VERY QUICKLY THIS

02:31:32.983 --> 02:31:34.685
IS MY MY SECOND LAST SLIDE. AND

02:31:34.752 --> 02:31:36.554
THEN AND THEN I HAVE A

02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:37.822
CONCLUSION. SO THE WAY THAT WE

02:31:37.888 --> 02:31:39.056
TYPICALLY IN THE LCFS ACCOUNT

02:31:39.123 --> 02:31:40.591
FOR LAND USE CHANGE IS WITH

02:31:40.658 --> 02:31:42.226
THIS ILUC INDIRECT LAND USE

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:44.361
CHANGE ADJUSTMENT, WE BASICALLY

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:46.664
JUST MOVE THE CROP BASED

02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:48.666
BIOFUELS TO THE LEFT ON THAT,

02:31:48.732 --> 02:31:50.701
THAT SEESAW. WE SAY YOU DON'T

02:31:50.768 --> 02:31:52.803
GET YOU DON'T GET TO BE QUITE

02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:53.704
AS FAR OUT THERE. YOU HAVE TO

02:31:53.771 --> 02:31:56.073
BE IN MORE. SO YOU'VE GOT TO

02:31:56.140 --> 02:31:57.641
USE MORE OF IT TO TO GET THINGS

02:31:57.708 --> 02:31:59.710
TO BE IN BALANCE. THE WAY THAT

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:00.811
WE DETERMINE THAT THROUGH

02:32:00.878 --> 02:32:01.445
TRADITIONALLY, THROUGH BOTH IN

02:32:01.512 --> 02:32:02.713
BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:04.215
IS BY VERY COMPLICATED

02:32:04.281 --> 02:32:05.683
MATHEMATICAL MODELS. AND SO IN

02:32:05.749 --> 02:32:06.417
THESE MODELS, WHAT THEY

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:07.451
SIMULATE IS AGRICULTURAL

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:08.786
PRODUCTION AND TRADE OF ALL OF

02:32:08.853 --> 02:32:10.521
THESE DIFFERENT CROPS AND ALL

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:12.623
OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS.

02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:13.724
TYPICALLY, I WOULD SAY THOSE

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:15.259
MODELS REQUIRE A LOT OF

02:32:15.326 --> 02:32:16.093
ASSUMPTIONS. THEY'RE VERY

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:20.464
OPAQUE. AND AND SO I THINK WE

02:32:20.531 --> 02:32:22.733
WE SHOULD VIEW WITH A LOT OF

02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:23.801
SKEPTICISM THE NUMBERS THAT

02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:25.569
COME OUT. ONE APPROACH TO THAT

02:32:25.636 --> 02:32:26.704
IS, AS COLLIN SUGGESTED, IS TO

02:32:26.770 --> 02:32:28.506
SAY, WELL, LET'S BE RISK AVERSE

02:32:28.572 --> 02:32:30.074
AND MAYBE BUMP THE NUMBER UP,

02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:31.642
BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. I

02:32:31.709 --> 02:32:33.477
THINK THE OTHER THING THAT

02:32:33.544 --> 02:32:34.445
WE'RE AT NOW IN A POSITION TO

02:32:34.512 --> 02:32:35.813
DO, WE'VE HAD BIOFUELS

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:36.847
EXTENSIVELY USED FOR 20 YEARS

02:32:36.914 --> 02:32:38.549
NOW, SO WE CAN LOOK AND SAY,

02:32:38.616 --> 02:32:39.817
WELL, WHAT HAS ACTUALLY

02:32:39.884 --> 02:32:41.785
HAPPENED? I WAS INVOLVED IN A

02:32:41.852 --> 02:32:42.620
STUDY WHERE WE SHOWED

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:44.054
SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF CARBON FROM

02:32:44.121 --> 02:32:46.423
EXPANSION OF CROPS IN THE

02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:48.759
UNITED STATES FOR CORN ETHANOL.

02:32:48.826 --> 02:32:50.561
I'M INVOLVED IN CURRENTLY DOING

02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:52.496
A SIMILAR KINDS OF THING,

02:32:52.563 --> 02:32:53.898
LOOKING AT DEFORESTATION IN

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:55.432
INDONESIA. SO I THINK THE THE

02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:56.734
POINT IS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:57.868
NOW MEASURE THESE THINGS. WE

02:32:57.935 --> 02:32:59.603
NEED TO DO THAT SO THAT WE CAN

02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:01.505
GROUND TRUTH, THE NUMBERS THAT

02:33:01.572 --> 02:33:02.640
WE'RE USING. BECAUSE IF

02:33:02.706 --> 02:33:03.707
ULTIMATELY WE'RE NOT REALLY

02:33:03.774 --> 02:33:04.508
GETTING BIG CLIMATE BENEFITS OR

02:33:04.575 --> 02:33:06.944
ANY CLIMATE BENEFITS FROM THESE

02:33:07.011 --> 02:33:07.745
BIOFUELS, THEN THEN WE

02:33:07.811 --> 02:33:08.812
SHOULDN'T REALLY BE

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:11.949
INCENTIVIZING THEM. YEAH. SO IN

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:14.518
CONCLUSION, WE DO NEED BETTER

02:33:14.585 --> 02:33:17.288
LAND USE CHANGE ASSESSMENT. I

02:33:17.354 --> 02:33:17.855
THINK IT'S IT'S INTEGRAL TO

02:33:17.922 --> 02:33:18.656
THIS PROGRAM DOING WHAT IT IT

02:33:18.722 --> 02:33:21.792
CLAIMS TO DO. ONE THING I'VE

02:33:21.859 --> 02:33:23.561
NOT TALKED ABOUT VERY MUCH IS

02:33:23.627 --> 02:33:25.663
ELECTRICITY. ELECTRICITY IN THE

02:33:25.729 --> 02:33:29.166
LCFS, I THINK COULD AND IS

02:33:29.233 --> 02:33:30.701
SOMEWHAT ADDITIONAL IN THE

02:33:30.768 --> 02:33:32.436
SENSE OF INCENTIVIZING

02:33:32.503 --> 02:33:33.704
EXPANSION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

02:33:33.771 --> 02:33:35.739
THAT PLOT THAT'S UP THERE ON

02:33:35.806 --> 02:33:36.640
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS THE

02:33:36.707 --> 02:33:38.609
PRICE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:39.710
THE UNITED STATES VERSUS IN

02:33:39.777 --> 02:33:41.512
CHINA. I THINK WE'RE IN A WORLD

02:33:41.579 --> 02:33:42.680
WHERE SOME NUMBER OF DECADES

02:33:42.746 --> 02:33:44.415
INTO THE FUTURE, WE WILL HAVE

02:33:44.481 --> 02:33:45.749
VERY LOW COST ELECTRIC VEHICLES

02:33:45.816 --> 02:33:48.218
AVAILABLE TO US AROUND THE

02:33:48.285 --> 02:33:50.521
WORLD, INCLUDING HERE. AND SO

02:33:50.588 --> 02:33:52.756
ONE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE GET

02:33:52.823 --> 02:33:54.925
FROM HERE TO THERE IN THE LEAST

02:33:54.992 --> 02:33:57.695
DISRUPTIVE AND LOWEST COST WAY?

02:33:57.761 --> 02:34:01.765
AND I THINK I WILL STOP THERE.

02:34:01.832 --> 02:34:12.076
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HI. WELL,

02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:13.510
I'M ANDY NAVARETTE, A

02:34:13.577 --> 02:34:14.945
RESEARCHER AT THE INTERNATIONAL

02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:16.480
COUNCIL ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION.

02:34:16.547 --> 02:34:18.949
I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR,

02:34:19.016 --> 02:34:19.717
ALVAREZ AND WILSON, FOR

02:34:19.783 --> 02:34:21.552
INVITING ME HERE. IT'S REALLY

02:34:21.619 --> 02:34:23.754
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO SHARE OUR

02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:25.689
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS PROGRAM.

02:34:25.756 --> 02:34:26.657
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOME SLIDES

02:34:26.724 --> 02:34:30.894
UP IN A IN A MOMENT. YEAH. SO

02:34:30.961 --> 02:34:32.963
WE CAN OH I GUESS I CAN ADVANCE

02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:35.032
THEM HERE OKAY. GOT IT. SO YEAH

02:34:35.099 --> 02:34:37.534
JUST ABOUT US BRIEFLY. SO WE'RE

02:34:37.601 --> 02:34:39.637
A NONPROFIT RESEARCH

02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:40.804
ORGANIZATION AND OUR WHOLE

02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:42.840
MISSION IS TO PROVIDE OBJECTIVE

02:34:42.906 --> 02:34:43.641
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS TO

02:34:43.707 --> 02:34:47.144
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS TO

02:34:47.211 --> 02:34:49.246
HELP IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:34:49.313 --> 02:34:50.781
SITUATION WITH TRANSPORTATION,

02:34:50.848 --> 02:34:52.716
BOTH ON GREENHOUSE GASES AND

02:34:52.783 --> 02:34:57.021
PUBLIC HEALTH. SO I'M GOING TO

02:34:57.087 --> 02:34:59.923
BE FOCUSING OUR COMMENTS TODAY

02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:03.527
OR MY COMMENTS TODAY ON. A LOT

02:35:03.594 --> 02:35:05.863
OF WHAT WE INCLUDED IN OUR

02:35:05.929 --> 02:35:08.098
COMMENTS ON THE ZEV FORWARD

02:35:08.165 --> 02:35:09.733
INITIATIVE. AND SO JUST TO

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:12.036
PROVIDE A KIND OF AN OVERVIEW.

02:35:12.102 --> 02:35:14.672
SO THE LCFS IS REALLY A KEY

02:35:14.738 --> 02:35:16.306
ENABLER OF THIS TRANSITION TO

02:35:16.373 --> 02:35:16.874
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. SO

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:18.642
THAT'S ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

02:35:18.709 --> 02:35:19.743
HYDROGEN VEHICLES WITH NO

02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:23.981
TAILPIPE EMISSIONS IN THE STATE.

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:25.549
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT

02:35:25.616 --> 02:35:27.851
WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION

02:35:27.918 --> 02:35:31.155
BE BOTH ORDERLY AND EQUITABLE.

02:35:31.221 --> 02:35:33.490
AND THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE

02:35:33.557 --> 02:35:35.826
MAKING THROUGH THE PROGRAM HAVE

02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:36.827
A LOT OF CO-BENEFITS. SO

02:35:36.894 --> 02:35:39.463
LOWERING FUEL COSTS, LOWER

02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:40.698
HEALTH IMPACTS, AND THE

02:35:40.764 --> 02:35:42.499
ECONOMIC BENEFITS WE GET FROM

02:35:42.566 --> 02:35:44.535
BEING A LEADER IN THIS KIND OF

02:35:44.601 --> 02:35:46.637
CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY AREA,

02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:48.439
THE THING THAT WE'VE OBSERVED

02:35:48.505 --> 02:35:52.009
WITH CFS AND WE'VE BEEN, YOU

02:35:52.076 --> 02:35:53.544
KNOW, RESEARCHING THIS FOR

02:35:53.610 --> 02:35:55.713
QUITE SOME TIME NOW IS THAT THE

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:57.781
LCFS IS ALSO SUBSIDIZING FUELS

02:35:57.848 --> 02:36:00.350
THAT HAVE SOME UNCERTAIN

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:03.520
BENEFITS. AND SO SPECIFICALLY

02:36:03.587 --> 02:36:06.490
MANURE, BIOMETHANE, ESPECIALLY

02:36:06.557 --> 02:36:08.492
WHEN PRODUCED IN OTHER STATES.

02:36:08.559 --> 02:36:10.994
IT'S UNCLEAR. YOU KNOW, EXACTLY

02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:12.763
WHAT BENEFIT THAT'S PROVIDING

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:14.231
TO THE CALIFORNIA

02:36:14.298 --> 02:36:15.866
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AND

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:18.702
RENEWABLE DIESEL IS ALSO BEING

02:36:18.769 --> 02:36:19.937
MANDATED FEDERALLY, AS WAS

02:36:20.003 --> 02:36:23.073
MENTIONED. BUT THAT'S BEING

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:24.174
DELIVERED INTO CALIFORNIA TO

02:36:24.241 --> 02:36:25.976
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LCFS

02:36:26.043 --> 02:36:28.178
CREDITS. AND SO THE OVERALL

02:36:28.245 --> 02:36:30.414
MESSAGE FROM OUR ZEV FORWARD

02:36:30.481 --> 02:36:33.550
COMMENTS IS THAT THERE COULD BE,

02:36:33.617 --> 02:36:34.651
YOU KNOW, UPDATES TO THE WAY

02:36:34.718 --> 02:36:36.720
THE PROGRAM WORKS TO PRIORITIZE

02:36:36.787 --> 02:36:38.856
THE FUELS USED IN ZERO EMISSION

02:36:38.922 --> 02:36:41.225
VEHICLES. THAT WOULD KIND OF

02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:42.693
BETTER ALIGN THE PROGRAM WITH

02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:44.528
OUR OUR GETTING TO OUR

02:36:44.595 --> 02:36:46.363
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION, AIR

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:49.633
QUALITY AND AFFORDABILITY

02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:50.567
TARGETS, YOU KNOW, MOST COST

02:36:50.634 --> 02:36:54.772
EFFECTIVELY. I WILL JUST SKIP

02:36:54.838 --> 02:36:56.974
OVER THIS. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE

02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:57.841
HAVE COMMITTED TO THIS 100% OF

02:36:57.908 --> 02:36:59.409
FUTURE. THERE'S AN EXECUTIVE

02:36:59.476 --> 02:37:01.745
ORDERS BEHIND THAT. THERE'S

02:37:01.812 --> 02:37:04.448
ASSEMBLY BILLS BEHIND THAT.

02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:05.582
TRANSPORTATION IS THE LARGEST

02:37:05.649 --> 02:37:07.551
SOURCE OF POLLUTION, BOTH

02:37:07.618 --> 02:37:09.253
GREENHOUSE GASES AND IMPACTING

02:37:09.319 --> 02:37:10.621
AIR QUALITY. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:37:10.687 --> 02:37:12.723
WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED THAT THIS

02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:14.758
IS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO DO.

02:37:14.825 --> 02:37:16.794
AND HAVING THESE ZERO EMISSION

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:18.362
VEHICLES DEPLOYED, OBVIOUSLY,

02:37:18.428 --> 02:37:20.664
THE MAJOR FOCUS OF THE LOW

02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:21.698
CARBON FUEL STANDARD IS

02:37:21.765 --> 02:37:22.499
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. BUT

02:37:22.566 --> 02:37:23.600
THERE'S ALL THESE OTHER

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:25.402
CO-BENEFITS THAT WE GET TO. SO

02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:26.570
IT'S A LOT CHEAPER TO OPERATE

02:37:26.637 --> 02:37:29.573
IN EV. YOU KNOW, WE'VE FOUND

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:32.075
THAT OVER THE FIRST SIX YEARS

02:37:32.142 --> 02:37:33.844
YOU'RE SAVING BETWEEN 6000 AND

02:37:33.911 --> 02:37:35.746
$11,000 IN YOUR VEHICLE. YOU

02:37:35.813 --> 02:37:39.216
KNOW, COSTS FOR FUEL AND

02:37:39.283 --> 02:37:40.083
MAINTENANCE. THESE IMPROVEMENTS

02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:42.920
TO AIR QUALITY, REDUCING

02:37:42.986 --> 02:37:45.489
PREMATURE DEATHS AND, YOU KNOW,

02:37:45.556 --> 02:37:46.924
SAVING BILLIONS IN IN

02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:48.859
HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND THERE'S

02:37:48.926 --> 02:37:50.460
ALSO JUST HUGE ECONOMIC

02:37:50.527 --> 02:37:52.296
BENEFITS WHEN YOU ADD THESE ALL

02:37:52.362 --> 02:37:54.565
TOGETHER. RECENT UC DAVIS STUDY

02:37:54.631 --> 02:37:57.768
ESTIMATED THAT IF WE HIT THE

02:37:57.835 --> 02:37:59.803
100% ZERO EMISSION TARGET BY

02:37:59.870 --> 02:38:02.005
2035, THAT COULD SAVE

02:38:02.072 --> 02:38:04.141
CALIFORNIANS 300 BILLION BY

02:38:04.208 --> 02:38:06.310
2050. SO IT REALLY ADDS UP OVER

02:38:06.376 --> 02:38:10.647
TIME. AND SO THE LCFS IS KIND

02:38:10.714 --> 02:38:13.450
OF A KEY PILLAR OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:38:13.517 --> 02:38:15.786
STRATEGY TO GET ZERO EMISSION

02:38:15.853 --> 02:38:17.554
VEHICLES OUT THERE. AND SO SOME

02:38:17.621 --> 02:38:19.690
OF THE WAYS THAT IT'S HELPING

02:38:19.756 --> 02:38:21.992
OUT WITH THAT, IS IT SUPPORTING

02:38:22.059 --> 02:38:24.061
PUBLIC CHARGING. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:38:24.127 --> 02:38:25.462
HAVING CHARGERS AVAILABLE AT

02:38:25.529 --> 02:38:28.665
WORKPLACES AND JUST, YOU KNOW,

02:38:28.732 --> 02:38:30.434
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MAKES EVS A

02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:32.970
VIABLE OPTION FOR EVERYONE WHO

02:38:33.036 --> 02:38:33.770
MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE ABLE

02:38:33.837 --> 02:38:37.074
TO CHARGE AT HOME. IT HELPS

02:38:37.140 --> 02:38:38.709
WITH EQUITY. SO AS WAS

02:38:38.775 --> 02:38:39.776
MENTIONED, THERE'S THESE

02:38:39.843 --> 02:38:41.011
CREDITS THAT UTILITIES GET AND

02:38:41.078 --> 02:38:43.213
75% OF THOSE HAVE TO GO TO

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:44.615
EQUITY PROJECTS. IN THE PAST,

02:38:44.681 --> 02:38:46.683
THOSE HAVE BEEN USED FOR EV

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:48.785
CHARGER REBATES FOR LOW INCOME

02:38:48.852 --> 02:38:49.519
FAMILIES, MULTIFAMILY

02:38:49.586 --> 02:38:51.855
PROPERTIES AND TO REDUCE THE

02:38:51.922 --> 02:38:55.325
COST OF PRE-OWNED EVS TO LOW

02:38:55.392 --> 02:38:56.593
INCOME DRIVERS. AND ESPECIALLY

02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:58.061
WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE

02:38:58.128 --> 02:39:00.697
FEDERAL LEVEL. YOU KNOW, A LOT

02:39:00.764 --> 02:39:02.399
OF THE SUPPORT FOR EVS AND

02:39:02.466 --> 02:39:03.700
OTHER THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA IS

02:39:03.767 --> 02:39:05.502
TRYING TO DO HAVE EITHER BEEN

02:39:05.569 --> 02:39:07.437
THREATENED OR TAKEN AWAY. AND

02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:10.040
SO THAT MAKES THE LCFS, YOU

02:39:10.107 --> 02:39:10.674
KNOW, EVEN MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT

02:39:10.741 --> 02:39:14.244
NOW TO SUPPORT OUR LONG TERM

02:39:14.311 --> 02:39:16.980
ZEV AMBITIONS. AND JUST TO

02:39:17.047 --> 02:39:19.449
PROVIDE A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF

02:39:19.516 --> 02:39:21.718
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT LCFS

02:39:21.785 --> 02:39:26.189
IS DOING TO TO HELP MOVE THIS

02:39:26.256 --> 02:39:28.692
FORWARD. SO SOMETHING LIKE

02:39:28.759 --> 02:39:30.594
CHARGING FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS.

02:39:30.661 --> 02:39:32.996
YOU HAVE THIS CHICKEN AND EGG

02:39:33.063 --> 02:39:34.498
PROBLEM WHERE A COMPANY IS NOT

02:39:34.564 --> 02:39:36.733
GOING TO GO OUT AND PUT A BUNCH

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:37.968
OF TRUCK CHARGERS OUT THERE IF

02:39:38.035 --> 02:39:39.937
THERE'S NO TRUCKS TO USE THEM

02:39:40.003 --> 02:39:41.672
AND GENERATE REVENUE, BUT

02:39:41.738 --> 02:39:42.506
WITHOUT THE CONFIDENCE THAT

02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:44.741
THERE'S GOING TO BE CHARGERS

02:39:44.808 --> 02:39:46.543
AROUND, NO COMPANY IS GOING TO

02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:47.744
WANT TO HAVE A ZERO EMISSION

02:39:47.811 --> 02:39:50.147
TRUCK THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE

02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:51.315
ABLE TO CHARGE IN DIFFERENT

02:39:51.381 --> 02:39:53.583
AREAS. AND SO WHAT THE LCFS

02:39:53.650 --> 02:39:57.888
DOES IS IT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO

02:39:57.955 --> 02:40:00.724
MAKE INVESTMENTS IN

02:40:00.791 --> 02:40:02.559
ANTICIPATION OF THE ROLLOUT OF

02:40:02.626 --> 02:40:03.961
THESE TRUCKS, WHICH ARE ALSO

02:40:04.027 --> 02:40:05.529
SUPPORTED. AND SO YOU GET

02:40:05.595 --> 02:40:06.730
EVERYTHING WORKING TOGETHER IN

02:40:06.797 --> 02:40:09.833
CONCERT. AND, YOU KNOW, WE GET

02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:11.902
A SMOOTHER KIND OF MORE COST

02:40:11.969 --> 02:40:13.403
EFFECTIVE TRAJECTORY TOWARDS

02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:19.142
OUR ZERO EMISSION GOALS. SO A

02:40:19.209 --> 02:40:20.844
LOT OF GREAT THINGS HAPPENING

02:40:20.911 --> 02:40:24.581
ON THE ZERO EMISSION SIDE. BUT

02:40:24.648 --> 02:40:25.749
WE WANT TO PUT THIS IN THE

02:40:25.816 --> 02:40:28.986
CONTEXT OF WHERE THE LOW CARBON

02:40:29.052 --> 02:40:30.821
FUEL STANDARD SUPPORT HAS BEEN

02:40:30.887 --> 02:40:33.457
GOING. AND SO HERE WE HAVE ON

02:40:33.523 --> 02:40:35.025
THE LEFT. IT'S BROKEN DOWN BY

02:40:35.092 --> 02:40:37.828
THE CREDITS GENERATED IN 2024.

02:40:37.894 --> 02:40:39.730
AND ON THE RIGHT IS THE VALUE

02:40:39.796 --> 02:40:42.833
OF THOSE CREDITS. IF YOU APPLY

02:40:42.899 --> 02:40:44.468
THE $62 AVERAGE CREDIT PRICE

02:40:44.534 --> 02:40:47.637
FROM 2024 AND YOU KNOW, AS HAS

02:40:47.704 --> 02:40:50.173
BEEN MENTIONED, I WOULDN'T SAY

02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:51.608
THAT THAT'S THE EXACT AMOUNT OF

02:40:51.675 --> 02:40:54.111
MONEY THAT FLOWED IN EACH TO

02:40:54.177 --> 02:40:54.644
EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:56.580
BECAUSE THERE'S THESE, YOU KNOW,

02:40:56.646 --> 02:40:57.848
MORE COMPLEX MARKET MECHANISMS,

02:40:57.914 --> 02:41:01.518
BUT IT'S A BALLPARK ESTIMATE OF

02:41:01.585 --> 02:41:03.420
WHAT THE CREDITS FOR EACH OF

02:41:03.487 --> 02:41:04.588
THOSE CATEGORIES WOULD HAVE

02:41:04.654 --> 02:41:06.757
BEEN VALUED AT. AND SO YOU CAN

02:41:06.823 --> 02:41:07.858
SEE THAT THERE'S VERY

02:41:07.924 --> 02:41:08.859
SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR

02:41:08.925 --> 02:41:10.660
ALTERNATIVE DIESEL. SO THAT'S

02:41:10.727 --> 02:41:12.195
RENEWABLE DIESEL AND BIODIESEL

02:41:12.262 --> 02:41:15.665
AND AND BIOMETHANE. BUT AS YOU

02:41:15.732 --> 02:41:16.900
KNOW WE'LL SEE I THINK THE

02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:19.169
BENEFITS FOR THOSE ARE A BIT

02:41:19.236 --> 02:41:20.670
LESS TANGIBLE. SO ON THE

02:41:20.737 --> 02:41:22.439
RENEWABLE DIESEL SIDE,

02:41:22.506 --> 02:41:23.640
RENEWABLE DIESEL PRODUCTION IS

02:41:23.707 --> 02:41:24.875
SUPPORTED BY THE FEDERAL

02:41:24.941 --> 02:41:27.544
RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD. BUT

02:41:27.611 --> 02:41:28.879
IT'S MOSTLY HAS BEEN CONSUMED

02:41:28.945 --> 02:41:31.882
IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE ADDED

02:41:31.948 --> 02:41:33.750
LCFS INCENTIVES. YOU KNOW, THE

02:41:33.817 --> 02:41:35.485
AIR QUALITY BENEFITS THAT WE

02:41:35.552 --> 02:41:37.921
GET FROM THIS ARE DEFINITELY

02:41:37.988 --> 02:41:39.556
NEGLIGIBLE COMPARED TO A ZERO

02:41:39.623 --> 02:41:42.592
EMISSION VEHICLE. AND WHEN YOU

02:41:42.659 --> 02:41:43.560
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE USING

02:41:43.627 --> 02:41:45.729
THEM IN A NEWER DIESEL ENGINE

02:41:45.796 --> 02:41:46.797
THAT ALREADY HAS EMISSION

02:41:46.863 --> 02:41:49.599
CONTROL TECHNOLOGY, IT'S NOT

02:41:49.666 --> 02:41:51.701
MAKING A HUGE IMPACT, REALLY.

02:41:51.768 --> 02:41:54.571
AND AS HAS BEEN STATED ALSO,

02:41:54.638 --> 02:41:56.373
WHEN WE'RE PRODUCING RENEWABLE

02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:58.675
DIESEL WITH VIRGIN OR UNUSED

02:41:58.742 --> 02:42:00.777
VEGETABLE OIL THAT CAN

02:42:00.844 --> 02:42:01.845
CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL

02:42:01.912 --> 02:42:04.147
DEFORESTATION, WHICH OFTEN

02:42:04.214 --> 02:42:06.883
OFFSETS MUCH OF THE GREENHOUSE

02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:09.252
GAS BENEFITS THAT THAT WE MIGHT

02:42:09.319 --> 02:42:12.522
BE GETTING. YEAH, THIS IS JUST

02:42:12.589 --> 02:42:14.191
ILLUSTRATING THAT WE'RE USING

02:42:14.257 --> 02:42:15.459
ALL THIS RENEWABLE DIESEL IN

02:42:15.525 --> 02:42:16.626
CALIFORNIA, BUT IT'S LARGELY

02:42:16.693 --> 02:42:20.430
PRODUCED IN OTHER STATES. AND

02:42:20.497 --> 02:42:22.699
SO SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT

02:42:22.766 --> 02:42:25.569
WE MADE THAT COULD BE CARRIED

02:42:25.635 --> 02:42:28.071
OUT IN OUR ZEV FORWARD COMMENTS

02:42:28.138 --> 02:42:31.741
IS THAT, WELL, FIRST OFF, I IS

02:42:31.808 --> 02:42:34.444
THERE'S WAYS TO SELECTIVELY

02:42:34.511 --> 02:42:36.613
SORRY. SO WE CAN'T SELECTIVELY

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:38.482
REDUCE THE CREDITS FROM OTHER

02:42:38.548 --> 02:42:40.050
STATES DUE TO THE COMMERCE

02:42:40.117 --> 02:42:44.654
CLAUSE. BUT AND THERE WAS SOME

02:42:44.721 --> 02:42:45.856
MEASURES IN THE MOST RECENT

02:42:45.922 --> 02:42:49.993
UPDATE TO, YOU KNOW, TRY TO

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:50.527
TAMP DOWN ON THE RENEWABLE

02:42:50.594 --> 02:42:51.628
DIESEL COMING FROM VIRGIN

02:42:51.695 --> 02:42:53.630
VEGETABLE OILS. BUT OUR

02:42:53.697 --> 02:42:55.365
RESEARCH BASICALLY SHOWS THAT

02:42:55.432 --> 02:42:57.534
THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO HAVE A

02:42:57.601 --> 02:42:59.736
VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT,

02:42:59.803 --> 02:43:01.505
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE BACKGROUND

02:43:01.571 --> 02:43:03.640
OF THE REALLY STRONG SUPPORT

02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:04.708
FOR BIOFUELS AT THE FEDERAL

02:43:04.774 --> 02:43:07.611
LEVEL RIGHT NOW. AND SO IN OUR

02:43:07.677 --> 02:43:08.812
ZEV FORWARD COMMENTS, WE WERE

02:43:08.879 --> 02:43:09.646
SAYING, AS OTHERS HAVE

02:43:09.713 --> 02:43:11.681
MENTIONED, WE COULD CONSIDER

02:43:11.748 --> 02:43:13.416
REEVALUATING THESE INDUCED LAND

02:43:13.483 --> 02:43:14.951
USE CHANGE EMISSIONS FOR CROP

02:43:15.018 --> 02:43:16.753
BASED FUELS AND ALSO CONSIDER

02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:18.755
ONLY CREDITING THE SHARE OF THE

02:43:18.822 --> 02:43:21.091
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS.

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:21.958
THAT'S BEYOND THE MINIMUMS THAT

02:43:22.025 --> 02:43:23.493
ARE REQUIRED IN THE RENEWABLE

02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:25.695
FUEL STANDARD. SO FOR THE FOR

02:43:25.762 --> 02:43:27.631
THE DIESEL FUEL TO COUNT UNDER

02:43:27.697 --> 02:43:28.865
THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD, IT

02:43:28.932 --> 02:43:31.334
HAS TO MEET A 50% GREENHOUSE

02:43:31.401 --> 02:43:32.636
GAS REDUCTIONS OVER DIESEL. SO

02:43:32.702 --> 02:43:35.138
WE COULD, YOU KNOW, JUST ONLY

02:43:35.205 --> 02:43:35.972
COUNT WHAT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND.

02:43:36.039 --> 02:43:37.741
THAT WOULD BE A POSSIBLE THING

02:43:37.807 --> 02:43:40.744
WE COULD DO ON THE MANURE

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:42.679
BIOMETHANE SIDE. SO IN THE LOW

02:43:42.746 --> 02:43:44.781
CARBON FUEL STANDARD, MANURE

02:43:44.848 --> 02:43:46.449
BIOMETHANE PATHWAYS GENERATE

02:43:46.516 --> 02:43:48.752
GET CREDIT FOR THE AVOIDED

02:43:48.818 --> 02:43:50.554
EMISSIONS THAT HAPPEN AT THE

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:55.425
FARMS. AND AS A RESULT, THESE

02:43:55.492 --> 02:43:56.927
FUELS GENERATE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:43:56.993 --> 02:43:58.695
MORE CREDITS THAN OTHER

02:43:58.762 --> 02:43:59.496
PATHWAYS BECAUSE THOSE ARE

02:43:59.563 --> 02:44:02.199
COUNTED INTO THE CARBON

02:44:02.265 --> 02:44:04.434
INTENSITY CALCULATION, EVEN

02:44:04.501 --> 02:44:06.937
THOUGH THOSE EMISSIONS ARE

02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:07.404
HAPPENING OUTSIDE THE

02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:08.538
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. SO

02:44:08.605 --> 02:44:10.874
THAT'S UNIQUE TO THIS PATHWAY.

02:44:10.941 --> 02:44:13.476
AND SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING

02:44:13.543 --> 02:44:15.612
IS YOU GET VERY VALUABLE

02:44:15.679 --> 02:44:18.682
CREDITS PER UNIT OF FUEL. SO ON

02:44:18.748 --> 02:44:20.784
THE RIGHT WE'RE LOOKING AT PER

02:44:20.850 --> 02:44:22.385
UNIT OF DIESEL GALLON

02:44:22.452 --> 02:44:25.755
EQUIVALENT BASICALLY. AND

02:44:25.822 --> 02:44:27.524
MOVING FORWARD. WHAT'S ALSO

02:44:27.591 --> 02:44:28.925
HAPPENED IS THAT RECENT UPDATES

02:44:28.992 --> 02:44:30.527
TO THE FEDERAL POLICY,

02:44:30.594 --> 02:44:32.662
INCLUDING IN THE IN THE ONE BIG

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:33.897
BEAUTIFUL BILL, ARE ACTUALLY

02:44:33.964 --> 02:44:35.632
GOING TO INCREASE THE SUBSIDY

02:44:35.699 --> 02:44:37.667
FOR THESE FUELS AT THE FEDERAL

02:44:37.734 --> 02:44:39.169
LEVEL BY QUITE A BIT. SO

02:44:39.236 --> 02:44:40.604
THEY'LL BE BENEFITING FROM THAT

02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:42.739
AS WELL. AND IT COULD BE UP TO

02:44:42.806 --> 02:44:44.507
TEN GALLONS, $10 RATHER PER

02:44:44.574 --> 02:44:48.812
GALLON EQUIVALENT FOR THE

02:44:48.878 --> 02:44:53.350
MANURE BIOMETHANE PATHWAYS. AND

02:44:53.416 --> 02:44:55.352
AGAIN, SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

02:44:55.418 --> 02:44:56.853
THESE PATHWAYS ARE COMING FROM

02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:58.455
OTHER STATES. AND THERE'S A LOT

02:44:58.521 --> 02:44:59.589
OF FURTHER POTENTIAL FOR

02:44:59.656 --> 02:45:01.758
EXPANSION. SO THIS IS JUST SOME

02:45:01.825 --> 02:45:03.760
RESEARCH WE DID LOOKING AT

02:45:03.827 --> 02:45:05.829
LARGE SWINE OPERATIONS ACROSS

02:45:05.895 --> 02:45:07.897
THE COUNTRY THAT COULD, YOU

02:45:07.964 --> 02:45:09.666
KNOW, INSTALL DIGESTERS AND

02:45:09.733 --> 02:45:10.800
START GENERATING CREDITS IN

02:45:10.867 --> 02:45:13.770
CALIFORNIA. AND SO AGAIN,

02:45:13.837 --> 02:45:15.739
THERE'S SOME UPDATES THAT COULD

02:45:15.805 --> 02:45:16.740
BE DONE TO KIND OF RIGHTSIZE

02:45:16.806 --> 02:45:20.810
THE SITUATION IN THE IN THE

02:45:20.877 --> 02:45:22.846
2024 PROGRAM CHANGES, THERE

02:45:22.912 --> 02:45:26.249
WERE MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:45:26.316 --> 02:45:27.751
THE BIOMETHANE IS ACTUALLY

02:45:27.817 --> 02:45:29.686
FLOWING TOWARDS CALIFORNIA IN

02:45:29.753 --> 02:45:31.755
THE PIPELINE AT THE VERY LEAST,

02:45:31.821 --> 02:45:34.257
BUT THESE DON'T GO INTO EFFECT

02:45:34.324 --> 02:45:36.626
UNTIL 2037 AT THE EARLIEST. AND

02:45:36.693 --> 02:45:39.529
SO, YOU KNOW, WE THINK THAT IT

02:45:39.596 --> 02:45:40.997
COULD BE CONSIDERED TO

02:45:41.064 --> 02:45:42.532
IMPLEMENT THAT SOONER. THERE

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:44.634
WAS ALSO A BOARD RESOLUTION TO

02:45:44.701 --> 02:45:46.269
REGULATE LIVESTOCK METHANE

02:45:46.336 --> 02:45:48.605
EMISSIONS, AND THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:45:48.672 --> 02:45:50.640
YOU TO PHASE OUT THESE AVOIDED

02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:52.342
EMISSIONS CREDITS, BECAUSE NOW

02:45:52.409 --> 02:45:53.576
IT'S A REGULATED SOURCE OF

02:45:53.643 --> 02:45:55.812
EMISSIONS. AND WE THINK CARB

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:58.148
COULD CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD

02:45:58.214 --> 02:46:01.518
WITH THAT. FINALLY, IN OUR ZEV

02:46:01.584 --> 02:46:02.986
FORWARD COMMENTS, WE ALSO

02:46:03.053 --> 02:46:04.387
PROPOSE SORT OF AN ALTERNATIVE

02:46:04.454 --> 02:46:06.656
APPROACH HERE, WHICH WOULD BE

02:46:06.723 --> 02:46:09.693
YOU COULD DIFFERENTIATE THE

02:46:09.759 --> 02:46:12.629
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUELS,

02:46:12.696 --> 02:46:14.397
BECAUSE THOSE ARE ACTUALLY

02:46:14.464 --> 02:46:15.565
CONTRIBUTING TO OUR LONG TERM

02:46:15.632 --> 02:46:17.500
GOAL. SO KIND OF, YOU KNOW,

02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:18.568
RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE ARE

02:46:18.635 --> 02:46:20.670
GETTING US TO WHERE WE NEED TO

02:46:20.737 --> 02:46:23.406
GO MORE SO THAN THE THE BROADER

02:46:23.473 --> 02:46:25.842
POOL OF FUELS. AND SO, FOR

02:46:25.909 --> 02:46:27.510
EXAMPLE, YOU COULD REQUIRE THAT

02:46:27.577 --> 02:46:29.679
A CERTAIN SHARE OF THE CREDIT

02:46:29.746 --> 02:46:30.847
PURCHASES HAVE TO BE FROM FUELS

02:46:30.914 --> 02:46:33.483
USED IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES.

02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:36.052
AND THEN WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS

02:46:36.119 --> 02:46:37.487
IN THE UNDIFFERENTIATED CREDIT

02:46:37.554 --> 02:46:39.589
MARKET WHERE ALL THE FUELS ARE

02:46:39.656 --> 02:46:41.491
PARTICIPATING, YOU KNOW, THE

02:46:41.558 --> 02:46:43.093
LOW CREDIT PRICES WOULDN'T BE A

02:46:43.159 --> 02:46:44.828
PROBLEM. THAT WOULD JUST SORT

02:46:44.894 --> 02:46:46.463
OF BE A NATURAL RESULT OF THE

02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:47.731
FACT THAT THESE FUELS ARE

02:46:47.797 --> 02:46:48.898
SUPPORTED FEDERALLY. THEY'RE

02:46:48.965 --> 02:46:50.433
ABLE TO BE BROUGHT INTO

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:52.602
CALIFORNIA AT A LOW COST,

02:46:52.669 --> 02:46:54.604
HELPING US MEET OUR, YOU KNOW,

02:46:54.671 --> 02:46:56.673
MEET THE FUEL STANDARD. AND IT

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.874
WOULDN'T REALLY BE A PROBLEM

02:46:57.941 --> 02:46:59.809
BECAUSE WE'D HAVE SECURED THE

02:46:59.876 --> 02:47:02.645
SUPPORT WE NEED TO HELP MEET

02:47:02.712 --> 02:47:05.548
THE ZERO EMISSION GOALS. AND SO

02:47:05.615 --> 02:47:06.783
MODELING THE IMPACT OF DOING

02:47:06.850 --> 02:47:08.485
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS

02:47:08.551 --> 02:47:10.019
SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING ON, AND

02:47:10.086 --> 02:47:12.889
WE WELCOME ENGAGEMENT ON THAT.

02:47:12.956 --> 02:47:16.426
SO JUST TO CONCLUDE HERE, THE

02:47:16.493 --> 02:47:19.262
LCFS IS A SUPER CRITICAL TOOL

02:47:19.329 --> 02:47:21.398
FOR GETTING US TO OUR ZERO

02:47:21.464 --> 02:47:23.600
EMISSION GOALS. WE DO THINK

02:47:23.666 --> 02:47:25.301
THAT THE CURRENT MARKET IS

02:47:25.368 --> 02:47:26.469
DISTORTED BY THE FEDERAL

02:47:26.536 --> 02:47:27.704
BIOFUEL STUDIES SUBSIDIES

02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:30.440
RATHER, AND THE AVOIDED METHANE

02:47:30.507 --> 02:47:32.509
CREDITING, YOU KNOW, UNDER THE

02:47:32.575 --> 02:47:34.077
CURRENT RULES, THERE'S KIND OF

02:47:34.144 --> 02:47:35.512
NO WAY TO HELP MORE SUPPORT FOR

02:47:35.578 --> 02:47:37.247
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WITHOUT

02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:38.982
INCREASING THE RENEWABLE DIESEL

02:47:39.048 --> 02:47:40.850
AND MANURE BIOGAS PATHWAYS

02:47:40.917 --> 02:47:43.019
SIMULTANEOUSLY. AND THAT WOULD

02:47:43.086 --> 02:47:43.686
INCREASE THE PROGRAM COSTS.

02:47:43.753 --> 02:47:45.622
THERE'S SEVERAL MEASURES THAT

02:47:45.688 --> 02:47:48.425
WE POINTED TO ALSO IN OUR

02:47:48.491 --> 02:47:49.726
COMMENTS, AND WE THINK THAT

02:47:49.793 --> 02:47:51.661
THESE WOULD BETTER ALIGN THE

02:47:51.728 --> 02:47:53.463
LCFS AND GENERATE MORE

02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:54.597
CO-BENEFITS WITH WHERE WE'RE

02:47:54.664 --> 02:47:57.133
TRYING TO MOVE AS A STATE. SO

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:58.435
THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HAPPY TO

02:47:58.501 --> 02:48:01.371
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.

02:48:01.438 --> 02:48:02.705
I'LL NOW MOVE IT OVER TO

02:48:02.772 --> 02:48:04.774
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SEE

02:48:04.841 --> 02:48:06.476
IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. WE

02:48:06.543 --> 02:48:07.677
APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE

02:48:07.744 --> 02:48:09.546
AND TAKING THE TIME TO PROVIDE

02:48:09.612 --> 02:48:11.815
YOUR EXPERTISE. AND NOW WE'LL

02:48:11.881 --> 02:48:16.319
MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS. CO CHAIR.

02:48:16.386 --> 02:48:19.522
THANK YOU. ACTUALLY I THINK I

02:48:19.589 --> 02:48:21.724
HAVE MORE I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.

02:48:21.791 --> 02:48:24.093
AND I'LL BE ABLE TO ASK JUST

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:24.861
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T

02:48:24.928 --> 02:48:26.563
HAVE THIS PRINTED OUT. AND SO

02:48:26.629 --> 02:48:29.299
IT WAS HARD TO TRY TO MENTALLY

02:48:29.365 --> 02:48:31.568
REMEMBER WHERE WE WHERE I SAW

02:48:31.634 --> 02:48:32.936
IT IN THE PRESENTATION AND

02:48:33.002 --> 02:48:34.471
WHERE THE WHERE MY QUESTIONS

02:48:34.537 --> 02:48:36.606
ARE ALIGNED WITH. BUT LET ME

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:39.476
TRY AND ASK AT LEAST A COUPLE.

02:48:39.542 --> 02:48:41.711
I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:48.785
PRESENTATION WHERE. THERE WAS A

02:48:48.852 --> 02:48:51.454
GRAPH AROUND THE. IT WAS LIKE A

02:48:51.521 --> 02:48:54.657
BACKWARDS LOOKING ANALYSIS ON

02:48:54.724 --> 02:48:57.560
THE PRICE PER CREDIT, AND I

02:48:57.627 --> 02:49:00.396
DON'T KNOW IF THAT I THERE WAS

02:49:00.463 --> 02:49:03.500
NO NUMBER. SO IT'S KIND OF HARD

02:49:03.566 --> 02:49:04.667
I GUESS I'M TRYING TO

02:49:04.734 --> 02:49:05.635
UNDERSTAND. ARE YOU TALKING

02:49:05.702 --> 02:49:06.870
ABOUT THE ONE WHERE THERE'S A

02:49:06.936 --> 02:49:09.439
BLUE BOX AND IT HAD THE, THE,

02:49:09.506 --> 02:49:10.673
THE CREDIT PRICE AND THEN THE

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:12.542
PRICE THAT WOULD BE AT THE PUMP

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:14.511
ON THE RETAIL PRICES. I THINK

02:49:14.577 --> 02:49:15.778
THAT WAS IT. YEAH. IF WE CAN

02:49:15.845 --> 02:49:17.514
FIND THAT ONE. YEAH. DOCTOR

02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:19.582
SMITH, DO YOU REMEMBER WHICH

02:49:19.649 --> 02:49:21.417
SLIDE NUMBER THAT WAS TO HELP

02:49:21.484 --> 02:49:23.853
OUR STAFF. 4 OR 5, 4 OR 5. SO

02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:25.154
TO THE SECOND SLIDE

02:49:25.221 --> 02:49:26.489
PRESENTATION AND THEN THE

02:49:26.556 --> 02:49:28.525
FOURTH OR FIFTH SLIDE. YEAH I

02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:30.660
WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I

02:49:30.727 --> 02:49:34.731
THINK THE COMMENT WAS I THINK

02:49:34.797 --> 02:49:37.033
THERE WAS SOME THERE WAS A

02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:39.002
THEORETICAL ANALYSIS MORE THAN

02:49:39.068 --> 02:49:40.436
A PRECISE ANALYSIS I THINK IS

02:49:40.503 --> 02:49:42.772
WHAT THE MAYBE YOU MADE THAT

02:49:42.839 --> 02:49:45.441
COMMENT OR I NOTED THAT ANYWAY,

02:49:45.508 --> 02:49:48.645
IS DO YOU HAVE A FUTURE LOOKING

02:49:48.711 --> 02:49:51.014
ANALYSIS BASED ON CURRENT

02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:54.050
POLICY? AND GIVEN THAT IT'S,

02:49:54.117 --> 02:49:55.852
YOU KNOW, THEORETICAL WHERE

02:49:55.919 --> 02:49:57.620
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY LAND?

02:49:57.687 --> 02:49:59.522
AND I KIND OF HAVE A SIMILAR

02:49:59.589 --> 02:50:00.790
QUESTION TO THE SECOND

02:50:00.857 --> 02:50:02.425
PRESENTATION, WHICH WAS THERE

02:50:02.492 --> 02:50:04.861
WAS ALSO SORT OF THIS BACKWARDS

02:50:04.928 --> 02:50:05.795
LOOKING TOWARD, YOU KNOW, THE

02:50:05.862 --> 02:50:07.430
LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WHERE WE

02:50:07.497 --> 02:50:09.566
ARE TODAY AND, YOU KNOW, THE

02:50:09.632 --> 02:50:11.401
GRAPH, THE BAR GRAPH THAT HAD

02:50:11.467 --> 02:50:14.604
THE DIFFERENT CORRESPONDING TO

02:50:14.671 --> 02:50:16.506
LCFS VERSUS NOT LCFS. AND I'M

02:50:16.573 --> 02:50:19.008
JUST CURIOUS KIND OF GOING

02:50:19.075 --> 02:50:21.077
FORWARD BASIS BOTH OF YOU HAVE

02:50:21.144 --> 02:50:22.979
STUDIED THIS LIKE ANY ANALYSIS

02:50:23.046 --> 02:50:25.715
OR OBSERVATIONS YOU'D LIKE TO

02:50:25.782 --> 02:50:26.783
MAKE ABOUT A GOING FORWARD

02:50:26.849 --> 02:50:29.552
BASIS. SO I CAN MAKE A COUPLE

02:50:29.619 --> 02:50:33.623
OF OBSERVATIONS. AND I CAN ALSO

02:50:33.690 --> 02:50:34.824
POINT TO SOME ANALYSIS WE DID

02:50:34.891 --> 02:50:37.293
THAT'S NOW A LITTLE OLD I THINK

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:39.462
IT WAS 2019. SO AS WE GO

02:50:39.529 --> 02:50:42.098
FORWARD IN TIME, THERE'S TWO

02:50:42.165 --> 02:50:43.433
THINGS HAPPENING. NUMBER ONE,

02:50:43.499 --> 02:50:44.667
BECAUSE THE STANDARD IS GETTING

02:50:44.734 --> 02:50:47.003
TIGHTER, WE NEED TO FIND MORE

02:50:47.070 --> 02:50:47.737
AND MORE CLEAN FUELS TO MEET

02:50:47.804 --> 02:50:49.539
THE STANDARD. THAT MEANS COSTS

02:50:49.606 --> 02:50:50.807
ARE GOING TO GO UP RIGHT. SO

02:50:50.873 --> 02:50:53.142
THAT'S THAT. SO THERE'S TWO

02:50:53.209 --> 02:50:53.710
FORCES. ONE FORCE IS PUSHING

02:50:53.776 --> 02:50:56.112
COSTS UP BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY

02:50:56.179 --> 02:50:57.480
75% OF THE DIESEL FUEL IS

02:50:57.547 --> 02:50:59.549
RENEWABLE. DIESEL POOL IN THE

02:50:59.616 --> 02:51:01.284
STATE IS RENEWABLE DIESEL. ONCE

02:51:01.351 --> 02:51:02.752
THAT GETS TO 100 WE CAN NO

02:51:02.819 --> 02:51:03.886
LONGER KEEP MOVING DIESEL OVER

02:51:03.953 --> 02:51:05.888
TO THE OTHER SIDE, INCREASING

02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:06.522
RENEWABLE DIESEL. WE'VE GOT TO

02:51:06.589 --> 02:51:08.558
FIND SOMETHING ELSE. RIGHT. SO

02:51:08.625 --> 02:51:09.792
SO IF TECHNOLOGY STAYS THE SAME,

02:51:09.859 --> 02:51:11.694
COSTS ARE GOING TO GO UP AND

02:51:11.761 --> 02:51:13.663
POTENTIALLY THEY COULD GO UP A

02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:14.897
LOT. THE WILD CARD AND THE

02:51:14.964 --> 02:51:16.532
THING THAT'S REALLY HARD TO

02:51:16.599 --> 02:51:18.901
PREDICT IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH

02:51:18.968 --> 02:51:20.470
TECHNOLOGY AND NOT EVEN

02:51:20.536 --> 02:51:21.738
TECHNOLOGY I GUESS JUST SCOPE

02:51:21.804 --> 02:51:23.506
FOR EXPANSION. I MEAN, I KNOW

02:51:23.573 --> 02:51:25.508
IN OUR STUDY IN 2019, WHEN WE

02:51:25.575 --> 02:51:26.643
PROJECTED THIS, WE WERE

02:51:26.709 --> 02:51:27.810
PROJECTING CREDIT PRICES WOULD

02:51:27.877 --> 02:51:29.479
JUMP UP TO THE CEILING BY 2030.

02:51:29.545 --> 02:51:30.813
ONE THING WE UNDER PREDICTED

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:32.749
WAS THE AMOUNT OF BIOGAS THAT

02:51:32.815 --> 02:51:34.450
WOULD COME INTO THE SYSTEM. AND

02:51:34.517 --> 02:51:36.753
SO WITH ALL OF THAT COMING IN,

02:51:36.819 --> 02:51:37.920
THAT'S ABLE TO BE THAT WAS

02:51:37.987 --> 02:51:39.589
DURING THAT TIME, AT LEAST IT

02:51:39.656 --> 02:51:40.823
WAS ABLE TO BE DEVELOPED AT A

02:51:40.890 --> 02:51:42.558
AT A PRICE THAT WAS, YOU KNOW,

02:51:42.625 --> 02:51:44.961
AT BELOW $200 A CREDIT. AND SO,

02:51:45.028 --> 02:51:47.497
SO, SO IT'S I WOULDN'T I

02:51:47.563 --> 02:51:48.831
WOULDN'T TRUST ANYONE WHO GIVES

02:51:48.898 --> 02:51:50.833
YOU A DEFINITIVE ANSWER TO THAT

02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:52.602
QUESTION. BUT, BUT THE, THE TWO

02:51:52.669 --> 02:51:54.737
FORCES ARE THAT AS YOU TIGHTEN

02:51:54.804 --> 02:51:55.938
THE STANDARD OVER TIME, IT'S

02:51:56.005 --> 02:51:57.907
GOING TO BE PUSHING PRICES UP.

02:51:57.974 --> 02:51:59.642
BUT AS WE GET CHEAPER ELECTRIC

02:51:59.709 --> 02:52:01.077
VEHICLES, FOR EXAMPLE, OR OTHER

02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:01.644
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS,

02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:02.845
THAT'S GOING TO BE PUSHING

02:52:02.912 --> 02:52:05.081
PRICES DOWN. SO WHICH EFFECT

02:52:05.148 --> 02:52:06.549
DOMINATES OVER TIME? IT CAN BE

02:52:06.616 --> 02:52:08.851
HARD TO PREDICT THAT. LET ME

02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:10.953
AGREE WITH THAT AND ADD TO IT

02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:14.123
BY SAYING WE DID SOME ANALYSIS

02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:14.590
PROJECTING SORT OF THE

02:52:14.657 --> 02:52:15.758
AGGREGATE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

02:52:15.825 --> 02:52:18.061
CREDITS IN THE LCFS MARKET

02:52:18.127 --> 02:52:18.695
BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS WE DID

02:52:18.761 --> 02:52:21.064
THIS LAST YEAR, SO WE DIDN'T

02:52:21.130 --> 02:52:22.832
HAVE A CHANCE TO DO IT WITH ALL

02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:24.200
THE CHANGES THAT THE NEW

02:52:24.267 --> 02:52:24.734
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ARE

02:52:24.801 --> 02:52:27.403
IMPOSING ON IT, BASED ON THE

02:52:27.470 --> 02:52:30.139
MARKET AT THE TIME, IT SEEMS

02:52:30.206 --> 02:52:31.374
VERY UNLIKELY WE'RE GOING TO

02:52:31.441 --> 02:52:32.642
SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:35.678
LCFS CREDIT PRICES ANYTIME SOON.

02:52:35.745 --> 02:52:38.681
WE HAVE STILL, WELL, YOU KNOW,

02:52:38.748 --> 02:52:40.383
75 I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE

02:52:40.450 --> 02:52:43.119
IN THE 80 TO 85% OF THE DIESEL

02:52:43.186 --> 02:52:44.721
POOL IS BIOMASS BASED DIESEL.

02:52:44.787 --> 02:52:46.789
NOW, THAT'S STILL ABOUT THREE

02:52:46.856 --> 02:52:47.824
QUARTERS OF A BILLION GALLONS

02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:49.392
OF DIESEL. SO THERE'S STILL

02:52:49.459 --> 02:52:50.593
SOME DIESEL MARKET LEFT TO GO

02:52:50.660 --> 02:52:53.629
AND KEEP GROWING THERE. AND BY

02:52:53.696 --> 02:52:55.565
THE TIME WE KIND OF EXHAUST THE

02:52:55.631 --> 02:52:58.067
ABILITY OF THAT TO MEET THE

02:52:58.134 --> 02:52:58.668
INCREASED TARGETS, LIGHT DUTY

02:52:58.735 --> 02:53:00.670
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE GOING TO

02:53:00.737 --> 02:53:02.772
BE PROVIDING A WHOLE LOT OF

02:53:02.839 --> 02:53:03.573
CREDITS AND FLOODING THE MARKET

02:53:03.639 --> 02:53:05.975
AND LIKELY TO PUSH CREDIT

02:53:06.042 --> 02:53:07.777
PRICES DOWN. SO WITH THE CAVEAT

02:53:07.844 --> 02:53:08.678
THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE THE

02:53:08.745 --> 02:53:09.846
MODELING TO REFLECT THE FEDERAL

02:53:09.912 --> 02:53:11.914
CHANGES, I DON'T THINK THOSE

02:53:11.981 --> 02:53:13.816
ARE GOING TO RADICALLY CHANGE

02:53:13.883 --> 02:53:16.986
THIS. MY MY SORT OF CONCLUSION

02:53:17.053 --> 02:53:19.021
IS IT'S UNLIKELY TO SEE

02:53:19.088 --> 02:53:20.823
PARTICULARLY HIGH CREDIT PRICES.

02:53:20.890 --> 02:53:22.725
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S MORE

02:53:22.792 --> 02:53:23.760
LIKELY THAN NOT THEY'LL STAY

02:53:23.826 --> 02:53:25.928
BELOW $100 FOR THE FUTURE. BUT,

02:53:25.995 --> 02:53:27.897
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF

02:53:27.964 --> 02:53:28.364
UNCERTAINTY AROUND ANY

02:53:28.431 --> 02:53:30.600
PROJECTION LIKE THAT AND NOT SO

02:53:30.666 --> 02:53:32.835
THAT, YOU KNOW, FOLKS FEEL THIS

02:53:32.902 --> 02:53:36.038
IS A CRITICISM, BUT MORE MAYBE

02:53:36.105 --> 02:53:37.673
A OBSERVATION IN THE

02:53:37.740 --> 02:53:39.142
DETERMINATIONS THAT ARE MADE IN

02:53:39.208 --> 02:53:43.746
THE ANALYSIS OF. WHEN CARB IS

02:53:43.813 --> 02:53:45.481
DISCUSSING OR WAS DISCUSSING

02:53:45.548 --> 02:53:48.017
THIS OR IS IN THE PAST, HAS IN

02:53:48.084 --> 02:53:51.788
THE PAST THOSE THOSE VARIABLES

02:53:51.854 --> 02:53:53.689
THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED AND

02:53:53.756 --> 02:53:58.861
DESCRIBED EARLIER. HOW IS THAT

02:53:58.928 --> 02:54:00.396
DISCUSSED IN THOSE DECISIONS

02:54:00.463 --> 02:54:03.566
THAT ARE MADE AT AT CARB'S

02:54:03.633 --> 02:54:04.700
LEVEL? AND UNFORTUNATELY, I

02:54:04.767 --> 02:54:06.435
THINK CHAIR RANDOLPH HAS GONE

02:54:06.502 --> 02:54:07.904
NOW. AND SO OTHERWISE I WOULD

02:54:07.970 --> 02:54:10.406
ASK DIRECTLY, BUT WHAT HAVE YOU

02:54:10.473 --> 02:54:12.508
HEARD IN TERMS OF THE

02:54:12.575 --> 02:54:13.776
DISCUSSION AS IT RELATES TO

02:54:13.843 --> 02:54:15.845
THOSE VARIABLES, AND HOW ARE

02:54:15.912 --> 02:54:19.749
THEY FACTORED INTO. YOU KNOW,

02:54:19.816 --> 02:54:20.716
OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T SPEAK ON

02:54:20.783 --> 02:54:22.585
BEHALF OF CARB AND HOW THEY

02:54:22.652 --> 02:54:24.854
MAKE THEIR DECISIONS. I DO KNOW

02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:25.822
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MODELING

02:54:25.888 --> 02:54:27.857
INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE

02:54:27.924 --> 02:54:28.558
MODELS, INCLUDING THE CATS

02:54:28.624 --> 02:54:31.160
MODEL AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT

02:54:31.227 --> 02:54:32.128
ARE USED TO INFORM THIS. YOU

02:54:32.195 --> 02:54:33.529
KNOW, THERE'S THE OLD SAYING

02:54:33.596 --> 02:54:35.665
THAT ALL MODELS ARE WRONG, SOME

02:54:35.731 --> 02:54:36.833
MODELS ARE USEFUL. AND THAT IS

02:54:36.899 --> 02:54:38.534
ABSOLUTELY TRUE IN THIS SPACE.

02:54:38.601 --> 02:54:40.570
I THINK THERE IS OFTEN A BIT OF

02:54:40.636 --> 02:54:42.805
A MISCONCEPTION THAT IF YOU

02:54:42.872 --> 02:54:43.706
HAVE A MODEL OF SOMETHING RIGHT,

02:54:43.773 --> 02:54:45.708
AND YOU PLUG IT'S BASED ON GOOD

02:54:45.775 --> 02:54:47.009
DATA AND YOU PLUG THE RIGHT

02:54:47.076 --> 02:54:48.578
DATA IN, IT'LL GIVE YOU A

02:54:48.644 --> 02:54:49.812
PREDICTION OF THE FUTURE. AND

02:54:49.879 --> 02:54:50.947
THAT'S REALLY NOT TRUE, BECAUSE

02:54:51.013 --> 02:54:52.582
EVERY MODEL IS GOING TO HAVE

02:54:52.648 --> 02:54:53.649
ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRED, AND EVERY

02:54:53.716 --> 02:54:54.817
MODEL IS GOING TO REQUIRE

02:54:54.884 --> 02:54:56.419
MAKING PREDICTIONS AND

02:54:56.485 --> 02:54:57.520
ABSTRACTING SOME THINGS AND

02:54:57.587 --> 02:54:59.622
SMOOTHING OVER AREAS WHERE WE

02:54:59.689 --> 02:55:01.390
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA. SO IN A

02:55:01.457 --> 02:55:02.758
LOT OF CASES, WHAT A MODEL

02:55:02.825 --> 02:55:04.961
TELLS YOU IS MORE ABOUT WHAT

02:55:05.027 --> 02:55:06.762
ASSUMPTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO

02:55:06.829 --> 02:55:08.564
ACHIEVE A GIVEN OUTCOME, SO IT

02:55:08.631 --> 02:55:10.633
CAN INFORM YOU. IT CAN GIVE YOU

02:55:10.700 --> 02:55:12.735
A LOT OF SORT OF, YOU KNOW,

02:55:12.802 --> 02:55:14.604
ALMOST WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING

02:55:14.670 --> 02:55:16.672
OF THAT, BUT IT CAN'T ALWAYS

02:55:16.739 --> 02:55:18.374
SAY WITH A LOT OF PRECISION

02:55:18.441 --> 02:55:19.642
QUANTITATIVELY, HERE'S EXACTLY

02:55:19.709 --> 02:55:20.776
WHERE YOU SHOULD SET THE TARGET.

02:55:20.843 --> 02:55:22.578
AND SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

02:55:22.645 --> 02:55:23.746
KIND OF THE PROCESS THAT GOES

02:55:23.813 --> 02:55:26.849
ON IS CARB LOOKS AT AT THESE

02:55:26.916 --> 02:55:28.484
MODELS, USES THEM FOR FOR

02:55:28.551 --> 02:55:29.752
GUIDANCE, RECOGNIZES THAT

02:55:29.819 --> 02:55:31.787
THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIMITED AND

02:55:31.854 --> 02:55:34.557
SIMPLY, YOU KNOW, TAKING THE

02:55:34.624 --> 02:55:35.825
QUANTITATIVE OUTPUT AT FACE

02:55:35.892 --> 02:55:38.628
VALUE ISN'T IS USUALLY NOT THE

02:55:38.694 --> 02:55:41.764
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. AND YOU

02:55:41.831 --> 02:55:44.500
KNOW WHAT MR. MURPHY SAID ABOUT

02:55:44.567 --> 02:55:47.570
THE MODELING RELATED TO THE

02:55:47.637 --> 02:55:49.505
WHAT THE COST WOULD BE? AND I

02:55:49.572 --> 02:55:51.974
THINK THAT'S SORT OF MY, MY

02:55:52.041 --> 02:55:52.742
BIGGEST TAKEAWAY FROM AND

02:55:52.808 --> 02:55:55.478
APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR

02:55:55.544 --> 02:55:56.679
PARTICIPATION HERE, BECAUSE

02:55:56.746 --> 02:55:59.515
OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE HEARD CERTAIN

02:55:59.582 --> 02:56:00.750
NUMBERS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

02:56:00.816 --> 02:56:02.718
COST TO CONSUMERS WERE GOING TO

02:56:02.785 --> 02:56:04.487
BE FOR, FOR, FOR GAS, AS A

02:56:04.553 --> 02:56:06.756
RESULT OF SOME MODELS, I THINK

02:56:06.822 --> 02:56:09.492
WE WERE ALL JUST, YOU KNOW, IT

02:56:09.558 --> 02:56:11.627
WAS A MOMENT OF LIKE, WELL,

02:56:11.694 --> 02:56:12.528
LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT'S

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:14.597
HAPPENING HERE? AND OF PAUSE,

02:56:14.664 --> 02:56:16.532
GIVEN WHERE THE COST OF LIVING

02:56:16.599 --> 02:56:18.801
IS FOR, FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND I

02:56:18.868 --> 02:56:21.637
THINK CERTAINLY A TAKE AWAY I,

02:56:21.704 --> 02:56:24.240
I HAVE FROM YOUR PRESENTATION

02:56:24.307 --> 02:56:26.943
HERE IS YOU USE CERTAIN

02:56:27.009 --> 02:56:27.977
ASSUMPTIONS AND DETERMINING

02:56:28.044 --> 02:56:30.613
WHAT THAT COULD BE. BUT ALSO

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:34.917
THAT'S A VERY YOU COULD ARGUE,

02:56:34.984 --> 02:56:35.718
CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL

02:56:35.785 --> 02:56:37.653
APPROACH, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:39.789
SEE THAT AS AS TO DETERMINING

02:56:39.855 --> 02:56:41.724
WHAT THAT COST COULD BE,

02:56:41.791 --> 02:56:42.625
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS

02:56:42.692 --> 02:56:45.094
THAT ARE UNKNOWN BUT ARE BUT

02:56:45.161 --> 02:56:46.462
BUT WE CAN EXPECT CAN PLAY A

02:56:46.529 --> 02:56:48.564
ROLE. WE JUST CAN'T REALLY

02:56:48.631 --> 02:56:49.966
QUANTIFY THAT ON THE FRONT END

02:56:50.032 --> 02:56:51.934
IS WHAT I THINK I UNDERSTOOD,

02:56:52.001 --> 02:56:52.835
AND I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY

02:56:52.902 --> 02:56:54.370
IMPORTANT AND HAS BEEN ONE OF

02:56:54.437 --> 02:56:55.604
MY SORT OF MISSIONS IN MY

02:56:55.671 --> 02:56:57.640
ACADEMIC WORK. IS IS SO MUCH

02:56:57.707 --> 02:56:58.574
ABOUT THE FUTURE WE DON'T KNOW.

02:56:58.641 --> 02:57:00.543
SO WE SHOULDN'T MAKE POLICY

02:57:00.609 --> 02:57:01.811
DEPENDING ON THE IDEA THAT WE

02:57:01.877 --> 02:57:03.746
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO

02:57:03.813 --> 02:57:05.314
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE

02:57:05.381 --> 02:57:06.682
DON'T. AND SO BRINGING IN THAT

02:57:06.749 --> 02:57:07.483
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT DO WE

02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:09.518
KNOW? WHAT DON'T WE KNOW, I

02:57:09.585 --> 02:57:10.953
THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:11.587
AND MAKING POLICY BASED ON, ON

02:57:11.654 --> 02:57:13.556
ON WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE

02:57:13.622 --> 02:57:15.691
DON'T KNOW. THE ONLY QUESTION I

02:57:15.758 --> 02:57:19.161
HAVE TO, MR. NAVARRETTE, ON THE

02:57:19.228 --> 02:57:21.130
PRESENTATION, I WAS TRYING TO

02:57:21.197 --> 02:57:22.698
REALLY FOLLOW ALONG. IT SOUNDED

02:57:22.765 --> 02:57:26.102
LIKE TO ME, AND PLEASE CORRECT

02:57:26.168 --> 02:57:27.503
ME IF I MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU

02:57:27.570 --> 02:57:28.671
WERE SUGGESTING IN YOUR

02:57:28.738 --> 02:57:30.873
PRESENTATION, THAT PERHAPS

02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:34.176
THERE SHOULD BE MORE SPECIFICS

02:57:34.243 --> 02:57:38.647
AND MAYBE PARAMETERS OR POLICY

02:57:38.714 --> 02:57:41.884
DIRECTION ON LCFS, ESSENTIALLY

02:57:41.951 --> 02:57:44.487
CREATING LESS OF A OF A MARKET

02:57:44.553 --> 02:57:46.689
DRIVEN SORT OF SYSTEM. IS THAT

02:57:46.756 --> 02:57:50.659
WHAT YOU WERE? SAYING IN YOUR

02:57:50.726 --> 02:57:52.728
COMMENTS, OR AT LEAST TRYING TO

02:57:52.795 --> 02:57:54.530
COMMUNICATE TO US? NO, I

02:57:54.597 --> 02:57:56.665
WOULDN'T QUITE PUT IT THAT WAY,

02:57:56.732 --> 02:58:04.907
I THINK MORE SO THAT. TO

02:58:04.974 --> 02:58:06.442
MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS, IT IS

02:58:06.509 --> 02:58:07.743
IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THESE

02:58:07.810 --> 02:58:09.812
OTHER FORCES THAT ARE HAPPENING.

02:58:09.879 --> 02:58:11.480
YOU KNOW, AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

02:58:11.547 --> 02:58:17.586
IN PARTICULAR, AND. INCORPORATE

02:58:17.653 --> 02:58:21.090
THOSE IN OUR ASSESSMENT OF HOW

02:58:21.157 --> 02:58:23.159
MUCH CREDIT, YOU KNOW, FUELS

02:58:23.225 --> 02:58:25.461
ARE GENERATING IN CALIFORNIA,

02:58:25.528 --> 02:58:27.730
RATHER THAN JUST ACT AS IF

02:58:27.797 --> 02:58:30.966
BECAUSE THE THING IS, LIKE THE

02:58:31.033 --> 02:58:33.769
IDEA WITH THE STANDARD IS

02:58:33.836 --> 02:58:35.604
EVERYBODY'S ON AN EQUAL PLAYING

02:58:35.671 --> 02:58:38.407
FIELD. AND SO THAT'S HOW YOU

02:58:38.474 --> 02:58:40.876
KNOW, YOU DERIVE, WHICH FUELS

02:58:40.943 --> 02:58:43.579
END UP IN THE SYSTEM. BUT WHEN

02:58:43.646 --> 02:58:45.147
THERE'S ALL THESE OUTSIDE

02:58:45.214 --> 02:58:47.450
FORCES THAT, YOU KNOW, SORT OF

02:58:47.516 --> 02:58:48.584
TILTS THE PLAYING FIELD IN

02:58:48.651 --> 02:58:50.686
CERTAIN DIRECTIONS AND IT MAKES

02:58:50.753 --> 02:58:52.588
THE PROGRAM LESS EFFECTIVE THAN

02:58:52.655 --> 02:58:54.657
IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE IN

02:58:54.723 --> 02:58:56.492
GETTING US WHERE WE WANT TO GO

02:58:56.559 --> 02:58:57.726
IN TERMS OF THE ZERO EMISSION

02:58:57.793 --> 02:59:00.429
VEHICLES AND OUR, YOU KNOW,

02:59:00.496 --> 02:59:01.630
ELIMINATING GREENHOUSE GASES IN

02:59:01.697 --> 02:59:03.866
THE STATE. YEAH. IF I COULD ADD

02:59:03.933 --> 02:59:05.668
ONE THING TO THAT, BECAUSE SO

02:59:05.734 --> 02:59:07.603
MUCH OF THE LCFS DEPENDS ON

02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:09.305
MODELING AND BECAUSE THERE'S

02:59:09.371 --> 02:59:09.939
ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRED THAT GIVES

02:59:10.005 --> 02:59:11.674
SOME FLEXIBILITY TO SORT OF

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:13.409
IMPART VALUES AND JUDGMENTS

02:59:13.476 --> 02:59:15.277
INTO THE PROGRAM AND CONFIGURE

02:59:15.344 --> 02:59:17.179
IT TO, TO, YOU KNOW, EMPHASIZE

02:59:17.246 --> 02:59:18.514
CERTAIN AREAS OR NOT. I THINK

02:59:18.581 --> 02:59:21.183
ONE OF THE AREAS OF, OF TENSION

02:59:21.250 --> 02:59:21.984
WHERE POLICY MAKERS LIKE

02:59:22.051 --> 02:59:23.619
YOURSELVES HAVE TO FIND BALANCE

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:25.654
IS YOU CAN HAVE A PROGRAM

02:59:25.721 --> 02:59:27.089
THAT'S OPTIMIZED TO MINIMIZE

02:59:27.156 --> 02:59:27.890
THE NEAR-TERM COMPLIANCE COSTS

02:59:27.957 --> 02:59:29.625
AND SORT OF MINIMIZE GAS PRICE

02:59:29.692 --> 02:59:32.795
IMPACTS IN THE NEAR TERM. BUT

02:59:32.862 --> 02:59:33.696
THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE TO

02:59:33.762 --> 02:59:35.097
MINIMIZE NEXT YEAR'S COMPLIANCE

02:59:35.164 --> 02:59:37.533
WITH THE LCFS, YOU KNOW, AND

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:38.734
THEN DECISIONS TO MINIMIZE THE

02:59:38.801 --> 02:59:39.702
FOLLOWING YEAR AND THE

02:59:39.768 --> 02:59:40.536
FOLLOWING YEAR AND THE

02:59:40.603 --> 02:59:41.637
FOLLOWING YEAR. THAT DOESN'T

02:59:41.704 --> 02:59:42.738
NECESSARILY GIVE YOU THE LOWEST

02:59:42.805 --> 02:59:44.406
COST, MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO GET

02:59:44.473 --> 02:59:45.674
TO YOUR LONG TERM GOAL TO GET

02:59:45.741 --> 02:59:48.077
TO CARBON NEUTRALITY AT THE END.

02:59:48.144 --> 02:59:48.978
AND SO I THINK, YOU KNOW,

02:59:49.044 --> 02:59:50.412
THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY TO

02:59:50.479 --> 02:59:51.714
PERFECTLY, YOU KNOW, POINT THE

02:59:51.780 --> 02:59:52.915
PROGRAM EXACTLY ONE DIRECTION

02:59:52.982 --> 02:59:54.950
OR THE OTHER. BUT I DO THINK

02:59:55.017 --> 02:59:56.152
THERE IS SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:59:56.218 --> 02:59:58.521
SAY, DO WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE

02:59:58.587 --> 02:59:59.522
MAXIMIZING THE EFFICIENCY OF

02:59:59.588 --> 03:00:00.689
THIS TRANSITION TO THE LONG

03:00:00.756 --> 03:00:02.858
TERM GOAL, OR DO WE WANT TO

03:00:02.925 --> 03:00:04.660
MAXIMIZE AND FIND THE LOWEST

03:00:04.727 --> 03:00:05.794
COST NEAR-TERM COMPLIANCE TO

03:00:05.861 --> 03:00:07.463
GET THROUGH THESE NEXT FEW

03:00:07.530 --> 03:00:09.532
YEARS AND MINIMIZE NEAR-TERM

03:00:09.598 --> 03:00:11.700
GAS COSTS? AND IT'S A SPECTRUM.

03:00:11.767 --> 03:00:13.502
YOU CAN FIND A PLACE IN THE

03:00:13.569 --> 03:00:14.637
MIDDLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO

03:00:14.703 --> 03:00:16.739
TOWARD ONE END OR THE OTHER,

03:00:16.805 --> 03:00:17.540
BUT THAT'S ULTIMATELY A VALUE

03:00:17.606 --> 03:00:18.741
DECISION, YOU KNOW? AND THAT'S

03:00:18.807 --> 03:00:19.775
SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN INFORM

03:00:19.842 --> 03:00:22.044
YOU. BUT ELECTED OFFICIALS,

03:00:22.111 --> 03:00:22.545
YOU'RE HERE TO SORT OF

03:00:22.611 --> 03:00:24.680
REPRESENT THE VALUES OF YOUR

03:00:24.747 --> 03:00:25.781
CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU.

03:00:25.848 --> 03:00:27.850
APPRECIATE YOU ALL. THANK YOU.

03:00:27.917 --> 03:00:29.451
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

03:00:29.518 --> 03:00:30.920
LACKEY. YEAH, I MEAN, NO

03:00:30.986 --> 03:00:33.989
DISRESPECT, BUT I, I FEEL LIKE

03:00:34.056 --> 03:00:36.525
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

03:00:36.592 --> 03:00:38.861
SPRINKLE SOME REALISM WITH THIS

03:00:38.928 --> 03:00:42.731
FORWARD PRESENTATION. LESS THAN

03:00:42.798 --> 03:00:45.501
25% OF OUR POPULATION CAN

03:00:45.568 --> 03:00:48.370
AFFORD ZEV VEHICLES. I QUOTED A

03:00:48.437 --> 03:00:49.738
RECENT STUDY THAT HAS INDICATED

03:00:49.805 --> 03:00:52.074
THE AVERAGE INCOME OF ZEV

03:00:52.141 --> 03:00:55.611
OWNERS IS ABOUT 190,000 A YEAR.

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:57.246
THE INCOME OF MY DISTRICT IS

03:00:57.313 --> 03:01:00.149
ABOUT 50. THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS

03:01:00.216 --> 03:01:02.518
PROBLEM. ZEV VEHICLES ALSO HAVE

03:01:02.585 --> 03:01:06.288
RANGE DIFFICULTIES. WHEN I TELL

03:01:06.355 --> 03:01:09.191
YOU THAT THE AVERAGE

03:01:09.258 --> 03:01:11.594
CONSTITUENT THAT I REPRESENT

03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:13.829
TRAVELS ABOUT WELL, AT LEAST

03:01:13.896 --> 03:01:17.166
OVER 100 MILES SOMETIMES EACH

03:01:17.233 --> 03:01:19.969
WAY. AND SO THERE'S RANGE

03:01:20.035 --> 03:01:21.570
DIFFICULTIES, BATTERY

03:01:21.637 --> 03:01:23.739
EFFICIENCIES, AND THE LIFE OF A

03:01:23.806 --> 03:01:24.673
BATTERY AND THE COST OF THE

03:01:24.740 --> 03:01:27.209
BATTERY. ALSO THE HAZARDS OF

03:01:27.276 --> 03:01:27.843
WHEN THEY CATCH FIRE. THERE ARE

03:01:27.910 --> 03:01:30.579
STILL SOME VERY SERIOUS

03:01:30.646 --> 03:01:31.647
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE NOT

03:01:31.714 --> 03:01:33.015
MENTIONED IN THE PRESENTATION

03:01:33.082 --> 03:01:36.752
THAT ARE REAL. AND FOR US TO

03:01:36.819 --> 03:01:39.888
RELY COMPLETELY ON THE ZEV

03:01:39.955 --> 03:01:42.458
IMPLEMENTATION, I THINK IS

03:01:42.524 --> 03:01:45.327
MISGUIDED. AND I THINK IT'S

03:01:45.394 --> 03:01:46.562
IT'S IT'S NOT REAL. IT'S JUST

03:01:46.629 --> 03:01:49.398
NOT REAL. I THINK THAT THESE

03:01:49.465 --> 03:01:51.433
ALTERNATE FUELS ARE REAL, AND

03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:53.135
ESPECIALLY THE PRODUCTION OF

03:01:53.202 --> 03:01:54.703
HYDROGEN. AND I THINK WE'RE

03:01:54.770 --> 03:01:56.005
GOING TO SEE HERE SOME

03:01:56.071 --> 03:01:58.641
PRESENTATIONS HERE IN THE NEAR

03:01:58.707 --> 03:01:59.875
FUTURE THAT MAKE ME OPTIMISTIC

03:01:59.942 --> 03:02:02.711
FOR THESE CLEAN ENERGY

03:02:02.778 --> 03:02:04.913
PROPOSALS NEED STRONG

03:02:04.980 --> 03:02:06.582
CONSIDERATION AND OVERRELIANCE

03:02:06.649 --> 03:02:09.218
ON ZEVS, I THINK IS MISGUIDED.

03:02:09.285 --> 03:02:11.220
SO I'M SORRY TO SHARE THAT, BUT

03:02:11.287 --> 03:02:14.523
I NEEDED TO IF I COULD RESPOND.

03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:16.625
SO YOU'RE CORRECT. RIGHT NOW,

03:02:16.692 --> 03:02:18.260
THE VAST MAJORITY OF ZEVS ARE

03:02:18.327 --> 03:02:19.628
OWNED BY BY PEOPLE, AND THE

03:02:19.695 --> 03:02:20.796
UPPER PART OF THE INCOME

03:02:20.863 --> 03:02:23.699
SPECTRUM, THE TECHNOLOGIES

03:02:23.766 --> 03:02:25.668
BEHIND ZEVS AND EVS ARE

03:02:25.734 --> 03:02:26.602
ADVANCING RAPIDLY. COSTS ARE

03:02:26.669 --> 03:02:28.570
COMING DOWN VERY RAPIDLY. AND

03:02:28.637 --> 03:02:30.773
WE HAVE PROJECTIONS WHICH HAVE

03:02:30.839 --> 03:02:33.709
SO FAR BEEN QUITE RIGHT,

03:02:33.776 --> 03:02:36.478
RELATIVELY ACCURATE, THAT

03:02:36.545 --> 03:02:37.980
PREDICT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:02:38.047 --> 03:02:39.848
CONTINUING TO, TO TO COME DOWN.

03:02:39.915 --> 03:02:41.650
SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT

03:02:41.717 --> 03:02:43.786
THAT THE EARLY EVS, THE FIRST

03:02:43.852 --> 03:02:45.821
ONES TO ENTER THE MARKET, WHICH

03:02:45.888 --> 03:02:47.056
IS MOST OF THE FLEET TODAY,

03:02:47.122 --> 03:02:49.024
THOSE WERE EXPENSIVE. AND WHEN

03:02:49.091 --> 03:02:50.893
YOU HAVE A NEW TECHNOLOGY, YOU

03:02:50.959 --> 03:02:52.728
KNOW, YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO

03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:54.063
GET IT INTO BUILD THE ECONOMIES

03:02:54.129 --> 03:02:55.698
OF SCALE AND GET TO THE POINT

03:02:55.764 --> 03:02:57.366
WHERE IT CAN BECOME CHEAPER.

03:02:57.433 --> 03:02:58.701
BUT I WOULD I WOULD JUST LIKE

03:02:58.767 --> 03:03:00.769
TO ADD TO YOU THAT THERE'S ALSO

03:03:00.836 --> 03:03:03.205
A STUDY THAT I JUST I DON'T

03:03:03.272 --> 03:03:03.772
HAVE IT BEFORE ME RIGHT NOW

03:03:03.839 --> 03:03:05.974
THAT IS INDICATED EVEN IN THE

03:03:06.041 --> 03:03:06.942
FUTURE, IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE

03:03:07.009 --> 03:03:07.676
MAJORITY OF MY DISTRICT WILL

03:03:07.743 --> 03:03:09.712
EVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD ZEVS. SO

03:03:09.778 --> 03:03:12.414
WE RECENTLY RELEASED SOME SOME

03:03:12.481 --> 03:03:15.050
MODELING ON THIS. MY COLLEAGUES

03:03:15.117 --> 03:03:16.151
LOU FULTON AND MARSHALL MILLER,

03:03:16.218 --> 03:03:17.553
BASED ON PROJECTIONS BOTH

03:03:17.619 --> 03:03:18.854
INTERNAL TO UC DAVIS AND

03:03:18.921 --> 03:03:22.624
ELSEWHERE, MOST OF THE LIGHT

03:03:22.691 --> 03:03:23.826
DUTY VEHICLES. SO PASSENGER

03:03:23.892 --> 03:03:26.528
CARS FOR, YOU KNOW, KIND OF THE

03:03:26.595 --> 03:03:27.863
SMALLER END OF THE SEDAN RANGE

03:03:27.930 --> 03:03:30.165
BY THE EARLY TO MID 2030S,

03:03:30.232 --> 03:03:30.766
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CHEAPER TO

03:03:30.833 --> 03:03:33.035
PURCHASE, NOT JUST OPERATE. THE

03:03:33.102 --> 03:03:33.769
OPERATIONAL COSTS ARE STILL

03:03:33.836 --> 03:03:34.603
BENEFITS ARE STILL THERE, BUT

03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:35.804
WILL BE CHEAPER TO PURCHASE.

03:03:35.871 --> 03:03:37.673
AND AS TIME GOES BY AND

03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:38.540
BATTERIES KEEP GETTING CHEAPER,

03:03:38.607 --> 03:03:41.577
THE ANTICIPATION IS MORE AND

03:03:41.643 --> 03:03:42.778
MORE OF THE FLEET. MORE AND

03:03:42.845 --> 03:03:44.446
MORE CLASSES OF VEHICLES ARE

03:03:44.513 --> 03:03:45.781
GOING TO BE CHEAPER TO PURCHASE

03:03:45.848 --> 03:03:47.783
AS AN EV THAN THEY WOULD AS AN

03:03:47.850 --> 03:03:48.650
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. YES,

03:03:48.717 --> 03:03:50.652
THAT IS A PROJECTION ABOUT THE

03:03:50.719 --> 03:03:52.588
FUTURE. BUT AGAIN, IT'S RELYING

03:03:52.654 --> 03:03:54.656
ON ON MODELS OF EV COST

03:03:54.723 --> 03:03:55.958
IMPROVEMENT AND CAPABILITY

03:03:56.024 --> 03:03:57.826
IMPROVEMENT THAT SO FAR HAVE

03:03:57.893 --> 03:03:59.595
BEEN PROVED OUT TO BE

03:03:59.661 --> 03:04:01.163
RELATIVELY CORRECT. SO WHILE

03:04:01.230 --> 03:04:03.632
THERE IS, YOU KNOW, THE CONCERN

03:04:03.699 --> 03:04:05.734
OVER THE HISTORICAL DISPOSITION

03:04:05.801 --> 03:04:10.372
OF WHO GETS EVS IS REAL, THE

03:04:10.439 --> 03:04:11.573
TECHNOLOGY IS EVOLVING, AND WE

03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:13.709
HAVE TO BE AWARE OF HOW THAT

03:04:13.776 --> 03:04:14.810
EVOLUTION IS GOING TO AFFECT

03:04:14.877 --> 03:04:16.545
THE AVAILABILITY OF EVS AND THE

03:04:16.612 --> 03:04:17.746
COST OF EVS FOR PEOPLE IN THE

03:04:17.813 --> 03:04:20.449
FUTURE. THAT'S UNDER DEBATE.

03:04:20.516 --> 03:04:23.786
THANK YOU. SO SOME FOLLOW UP

03:04:23.852 --> 03:04:25.821
QUESTIONS. SO ONE OF THE

03:04:25.888 --> 03:04:26.688
QUESTIONS THAT COME TO MIND

03:04:26.755 --> 03:04:27.823
PRIOR TO COMING IN HERE,

03:04:27.890 --> 03:04:29.491
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

03:04:29.558 --> 03:04:32.361
OUT OF STATE CREDITS AND WHO

03:04:32.428 --> 03:04:34.563
WHO BENEFITS IS WHETHER WE'RE

03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:36.899
BENEFITING AS CALIFORNIANS

03:04:36.965 --> 03:04:37.266
ECONOMICALLY AND

03:04:37.332 --> 03:04:38.467
ENVIRONMENTALLY. AND WHAT I

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:39.668
THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY AND I'M

03:04:39.735 --> 03:04:41.770
GOING TO STATE IT, THIS YOU

03:04:41.837 --> 03:04:43.472
SAID IT THIS WAY, BUT I'M GOING

03:04:43.539 --> 03:04:44.840
TO ADD SOMETHING ON TO IT AND

03:04:44.907 --> 03:04:47.242
TELL ME IF THIS IS AN ACCURATE

03:04:47.309 --> 03:04:47.876
STATEMENT, THAT THE AIR QUALITY

03:04:47.943 --> 03:04:49.578
BENEFITS OCCUR WHERE IT IS

03:04:49.645 --> 03:04:50.045
CONSUMED, WHICH MEANS

03:04:50.112 --> 03:04:51.046
CALIFORNIA GETS THE GREATER

03:04:51.113 --> 03:04:52.448
BENEFITS. BUT THE ECONOMIC

03:04:52.514 --> 03:04:54.716
BENEFIT IS WHERE THE

03:04:54.783 --> 03:04:55.751
INVESTMENTS OCCUR. IS THAT AN

03:04:55.818 --> 03:04:58.654
ACCURATE STATEMENT? FOR THE

03:04:58.720 --> 03:05:00.856
MOST PART, YES, IN THE

03:05:00.923 --> 03:05:02.724
SIMPLIFIED WAY. RIGHT. I WOULD

03:05:02.791 --> 03:05:04.526
ALSO SAY THE VALUE OF SLOWING

03:05:04.593 --> 03:05:06.595
CLIMATE CHANGE IS VERY REAL. IT

03:05:06.662 --> 03:05:08.263
HAS A HUGE ECONOMIC COST. ASK

03:05:08.330 --> 03:05:10.165
THE RESIDENTS OF PARADISE OR

03:05:10.232 --> 03:05:14.870
ALTADENA ABOUT THAT. AND SO SO

03:05:14.937 --> 03:05:17.739
THE INDIRECT. THE INDIRECT

03:05:17.806 --> 03:05:19.541
ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS ABOUT THEN

03:05:19.608 --> 03:05:23.145
THE COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE. YES

03:05:23.212 --> 03:05:24.646
THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. SO WE

03:05:24.713 --> 03:05:25.814
MIGHT NOT GET THE ECONOMIC

03:05:25.881 --> 03:05:27.616
BENEFIT IN THE PLUS YOU KNOW

03:05:27.683 --> 03:05:29.685
SIDE. BUT WE WOULD IN THE, THE

03:05:29.751 --> 03:05:31.487
SAVINGS SIDE. IS THAT WHAT

03:05:31.553 --> 03:05:32.688
YOU'RE SAYING. YES. SO IF

03:05:32.754 --> 03:05:34.289
YOU'RE IF WE'RE FOCUSED ON

03:05:34.356 --> 03:05:36.058
THINGS LIKE THE, THE JOBS FROM

03:05:36.124 --> 03:05:36.692
PRODUCING AND PRODUCING,

03:05:36.758 --> 03:05:37.693
REFINING, TRANSPORTING,

03:05:37.759 --> 03:05:39.828
DISTRIBUTING FUELS, SOME OF

03:05:39.895 --> 03:05:41.897
THAT NECESSARILY HAPPENS IN

03:05:41.964 --> 03:05:42.498
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE EVENTUALLY

03:05:42.564 --> 03:05:43.765
HAS TO COME TO CALIFORNIA. THE

03:05:43.832 --> 03:05:46.001
FUEL, THE FUELING STATION, THE

03:05:46.068 --> 03:05:47.603
FUEL DISPENSER, THE CHARGING

03:05:47.669 --> 03:05:49.505
DISPENSER HAS TO BE THERE. SO

03:05:49.571 --> 03:05:51.640
THERE'S REALLY NO WAY AROUND

03:05:51.707 --> 03:05:52.808
SOME PART OF THAT ECONOMIC

03:05:52.875 --> 03:05:53.842
ACTIVITY HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA.

03:05:53.909 --> 03:05:54.643
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. IF YOU'RE

03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:56.945
PRODUCING SOMETHING LIKE A, YOU

03:05:57.012 --> 03:05:57.546
KNOW, A BIOMASS BASED DIESEL

03:05:57.613 --> 03:05:59.648
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE, PROBABLY

03:05:59.715 --> 03:06:01.817
MOST OF THE EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

03:06:01.884 --> 03:06:03.585
AND THE JOB CREATION AND THAT

03:06:03.652 --> 03:06:05.587
ASSOCIATED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

03:06:05.654 --> 03:06:07.222
WOULD HAPPEN WHERE THE FUEL IS

03:06:07.289 --> 03:06:08.657
PRODUCED. OKAY. AND THEN

03:06:08.724 --> 03:06:10.392
TALKING ABOUT COST, BECAUSE

03:06:10.459 --> 03:06:11.760
THERE WAS A BIG CONVERSATION

03:06:11.827 --> 03:06:13.529
ABOUT COSTS ARE GOING TO GO UP

03:06:13.595 --> 03:06:15.597
$0.65. AND I THINK YOU HAD A

03:06:15.664 --> 03:06:16.832
SLIDE THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, HEY,

03:06:16.899 --> 03:06:17.699
UNDER THE NEW REGULATIONS,

03:06:17.766 --> 03:06:18.800
$0.62, RIGHT? WHICH IS FAIRLY

03:06:18.867 --> 03:06:20.802
CLOSE. AND SO I'M WONDERING

03:06:20.869 --> 03:06:24.640
THEN, BECAUSE THE DIRTY FUEL IS

03:06:24.706 --> 03:06:25.908
PAYING FOR THE CLEAN FUEL.

03:06:25.974 --> 03:06:28.677
RIGHT. AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

03:06:28.744 --> 03:06:30.445
FACT THAT WE WOULD OVERALL SEEM

03:06:30.512 --> 03:06:32.681
TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT. YOU'D

03:06:32.748 --> 03:06:35.584
HAVE LESS DIRTY FUEL AS PEOPLE

03:06:35.651 --> 03:06:38.787
CONVERT TO EVS, YOU'D HAVE LESS

03:06:38.854 --> 03:06:41.690
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, USING THE

03:06:41.757 --> 03:06:43.392
DIRTY FUEL. SO THAT MEANS THERE

03:06:43.458 --> 03:06:45.694
PER COSTS THEN GOES UP. AND IS

03:06:45.761 --> 03:06:47.896
THAT WHERE THE SKYROCKETING

03:06:47.963 --> 03:06:49.631
COST OCCURS AS WELL? THAT'S

03:06:49.698 --> 03:06:50.832
THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE POSSIBLE

03:06:50.899 --> 03:06:53.569
OUTCOME. THAT IS, WHETHER THAT

03:06:53.635 --> 03:06:54.836
HAPPENS IS GOING TO DEPEND ON

03:06:54.903 --> 03:06:56.371
THE SPECIFICS OF THE CREDIT

03:06:56.438 --> 03:06:57.606
PRICE AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

03:06:57.673 --> 03:06:59.641
IN THE AND THE RELATIVE TARGET.

03:06:59.708 --> 03:07:00.776
BUT IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. I

03:07:00.842 --> 03:07:01.710
THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY

03:07:01.777 --> 03:07:03.545
IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE FOCUS

03:07:03.612 --> 03:07:04.780
ON MAKING SURE THAT LOWER

03:07:04.846 --> 03:07:06.415
INCOME PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

03:07:06.481 --> 03:07:08.116
EVS AND HAVE ACCESS TO VEHICLES

03:07:08.183 --> 03:07:09.785
THAT CAN CONSUME THE FUELS THAT

03:07:09.851 --> 03:07:11.587
RECEIVE INCENTIVES FROM THE

03:07:11.653 --> 03:07:13.622
PROGRAM. IF SOMEBODY MAKES A

03:07:13.689 --> 03:07:16.091
PERSONAL CHOICE TO STAY IN AN

03:07:16.158 --> 03:07:16.692
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE AND

03:07:16.758 --> 03:07:18.727
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO DO

03:07:18.794 --> 03:07:19.895
THAT, MOST PEOPLE, IF YOU'RE

03:07:19.962 --> 03:07:21.697
KIND OF MIDDLE OR UPPER INCOME

03:07:21.763 --> 03:07:23.298
TRANSPORTATION, IS A RELATIVELY

03:07:23.365 --> 03:07:25.534
SMALL PART OF OF THE BUDGET.

03:07:25.601 --> 03:07:26.735
THAT'S A CHOICE PEOPLE CAN MAKE.

03:07:26.802 --> 03:07:27.970
AND WE'RE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO

03:07:28.036 --> 03:07:29.504
LET PEOPLE MAKE THOSE CHOICES.

03:07:29.571 --> 03:07:30.772
I THINK THE WHERE WE ONLY FOCUS

03:07:30.839 --> 03:07:33.342
IS ENSURING PEOPLE WHO DON'T

03:07:33.408 --> 03:07:33.909
HAVE A CHOICE, WHO ONLY HAVE

03:07:33.976 --> 03:07:35.510
ONE METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION,

03:07:35.577 --> 03:07:37.179
THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

03:07:37.245 --> 03:07:38.013
TO GET OUT OF A GASOLINE

03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:39.748
POWERED VEHICLE BEFORE THAT

03:07:39.815 --> 03:07:41.883
HAPPENS, OR TO TRY TO MAKE SURE

03:07:41.950 --> 03:07:43.852
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT, THAT

03:07:43.919 --> 03:07:44.853
SORT OF RUNAWAY IN THE FUTURE.

03:07:44.920 --> 03:07:46.521
THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS,

03:07:46.588 --> 03:07:48.790
I THINK THAT THAT HIGHER NUMBER

03:07:48.857 --> 03:07:49.891
OF THE 62 CENT NUMBER YOU

03:07:49.958 --> 03:07:51.627
PULLED WAS FROM THE SCENARIOS

03:07:51.693 --> 03:07:54.162
THAT THAT AARON PUT FORWARD. IF

03:07:54.229 --> 03:07:54.730
THE CREDIT PRICE WAS AT THE

03:07:54.796 --> 03:07:57.532
$250 CEILING, RIGHT, WHICH I

03:07:57.599 --> 03:07:58.800
THINK WE DON'T SEE IT, WE'LL GO

03:07:58.867 --> 03:08:01.570
BACK TO THAT. AND TO BE

03:08:01.637 --> 03:08:03.805
SPECIFIC, THAT THAT 62 CENT

03:08:03.872 --> 03:08:04.606
NUMBER WAS WHAT IF TODAY THE

03:08:04.673 --> 03:08:06.742
CREDIT PRICE WAS $250 AND THE

03:08:06.808 --> 03:08:08.810
CREDIT PRICE IS NOT $250, IT'S

03:08:08.877 --> 03:08:10.746
$60, RIGHT. AND BASED ON THE

03:08:10.812 --> 03:08:12.547
DEMAND OR BASED ON THE SUPPLY

03:08:12.614 --> 03:08:14.583
WOULDN'T GET THERE. IT WAS.

03:08:14.650 --> 03:08:16.618
YEAH. IT GOT THAT HIGH BECAUSE

03:08:16.685 --> 03:08:17.953
OF THE SUPPLY IN 2030. YOU KNOW,

03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:20.555
I THINK WE SHOULD YOU KNOW, WE

03:08:20.622 --> 03:08:22.824
SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR A RANGE

03:08:22.891 --> 03:08:25.961
OF POSSIBILITIES. AND THAT'S

03:08:26.028 --> 03:08:28.664
BECAUSE WE'RE WE HAVE WE PEOPLE

03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:31.366
ARE USING MORE OF THAT AND LESS

03:08:31.433 --> 03:08:32.701
OF THE DIRTY IS THE TWO FORCES

03:08:32.768 --> 03:08:34.736
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE MORE

03:08:34.803 --> 03:08:35.904
AND MORE CLEAN STUFF. AND SO

03:08:35.971 --> 03:08:37.506
THAT GETS MORE EXPENSIVE THAT

03:08:37.572 --> 03:08:39.007
THAT FORCE PUSHES PRICES UP.

03:08:39.074 --> 03:08:39.875
BUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

03:08:39.941 --> 03:08:41.410
NEW CLEAN FUELS THAT ARE

03:08:41.476 --> 03:08:42.477
GETTING CHEAPER, THAT ARE

03:08:42.544 --> 03:08:43.679
COMING ONLINE. AND THAT'S GOING

03:08:43.745 --> 03:08:45.380
TO PUSH PRICES DOWN. SO SO IT'S

03:08:45.447 --> 03:08:46.615
LIKE WHICH ONE WINS? AND I

03:08:46.682 --> 03:08:49.117
THINK I MEAN I DO AGREE WITH

03:08:49.184 --> 03:08:50.452
COLIN. I THINK I THINK THE THE

03:08:50.519 --> 03:08:51.687
COST OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS

03:08:51.753 --> 03:08:54.456
GOING TO DECLINE FAST AND

03:08:54.523 --> 03:08:56.591
FASTER THAN PERHAPS A LOT OF

03:08:56.658 --> 03:08:57.793
REGULAR PEOPLE THINK. AND SO I

03:08:57.859 --> 03:08:59.494
THINK WE'LL BE HAVING A

03:08:59.561 --> 03:09:00.562
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION TEN

03:09:00.629 --> 03:09:01.830
YEARS FROM NOW. BUT I MIGHT BE

03:09:01.897 --> 03:09:03.498
WRONG, HAVING BEEN TO VIETNAM

03:09:03.565 --> 03:09:04.733
AND SEEN SOME OF THE THEIR

03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:06.702
VEHICLES THERE, I MEAN, JUST

03:09:06.768 --> 03:09:08.003
HAVING NOW BEEN OTHER PLACES

03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:09.471
AND, AND SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING

03:09:09.538 --> 03:09:10.639
WITH THEIR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. I

03:09:10.706 --> 03:09:11.873
THINK UNITED STATES FALLING

03:09:11.940 --> 03:09:14.576
BEHIND I THINK. YEAH. YOU NOTED,

03:09:14.643 --> 03:09:15.877
COLIN, YOU NOTED WHEN TALKING

03:09:15.944 --> 03:09:17.979
ABOUT I LIKE YOU SAID, IF YOU

03:09:18.046 --> 03:09:19.715
GET IT WRONG, IT COULD BE VERY

03:09:19.781 --> 03:09:21.583
SEVERE. AND SO COULD YOU TALK A

03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:23.985
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT

03:09:24.052 --> 03:09:25.887
IS. YEAH. IF YOU SO YOU'RE UP

03:09:25.954 --> 03:09:27.556
IN THE 2000 WHEN THEY FIRST

03:09:27.622 --> 03:09:28.757
STARTED SORT OF ENGAGING ON

03:09:28.824 --> 03:09:29.825
ALTERNATIVE FUEL POLICIES,

03:09:29.891 --> 03:09:31.493
THEIR THEIR FLEET IS LARGELY

03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:32.761
MORE DIESEL HEAVY THAN, THAN

03:09:32.828 --> 03:09:35.464
THE US FLEET. SO THEIR

03:09:35.530 --> 03:09:36.531
SUBSIDIES TENDED TO EMPHASIZE

03:09:36.598 --> 03:09:37.799
DIESEL. THEY DIDN'T WHEN THEY

03:09:37.866 --> 03:09:38.967
FIRST DESIGNED THE FIRST DRAFT

03:09:39.034 --> 03:09:40.602
OF THESE POLICIES, DIDN'T HAVE

03:09:40.669 --> 03:09:41.703
ENOUGH CONSIDERATION OF THINGS

03:09:41.770 --> 03:09:43.371
LIKE INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGE.

03:09:43.438 --> 03:09:46.074
SO THEY GOT A LOT OF BIODIESEL

03:09:46.141 --> 03:09:47.042
AND SOME RENEWABLE DIESEL, ALL

03:09:47.109 --> 03:09:48.543
OF IT MADE FROM LIPIDS, AGAIN.

03:09:48.610 --> 03:09:50.912
SO FATS, OILS, GREASES. A LOT

03:09:50.979 --> 03:09:51.980
OF IT CAME FROM FROM VEGETABLE

03:09:52.047 --> 03:09:54.516
OIL. THEY GOT A LOT OF PALM OIL

03:09:54.583 --> 03:09:56.118
DERIVED BIOFUEL. AND SO WHEN

03:09:56.184 --> 03:09:58.220
YOU WHEN YOU JUST LOOK AT KIND

03:09:58.286 --> 03:09:59.521
OF THE, THE FERTILIZER GOES

03:09:59.588 --> 03:10:01.189
INTO GROWING PALM AND THE

03:10:01.256 --> 03:10:01.923
ENERGY NEEDED TO CONVERT IT

03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:03.925
INTO FUEL AND BRING IT TO

03:10:03.992 --> 03:10:05.794
MARKET, WHICH IS IGNORING THE

03:10:05.861 --> 03:10:06.962
INTELLECT, INDIRECT LAND USE

03:10:07.028 --> 03:10:07.829
CHANGE EFFECT. THOSE FUELS LOOK

03:10:07.896 --> 03:10:09.598
LIKE THEY'RE LOW CARBON, BUT

03:10:09.664 --> 03:10:10.899
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE PALM

03:10:10.966 --> 03:10:12.834
THAT WAS USED TO SATISFY THAT

03:10:12.901 --> 03:10:13.869
DEMAND CAME FROM INDONESIA AND

03:10:13.935 --> 03:10:15.403
OTHER AND MALAYSIA AND OTHER

03:10:15.470 --> 03:10:16.571
PARTS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, IT

03:10:16.638 --> 03:10:19.474
LARGELY CAME FROM AREAS WHERE

03:10:19.541 --> 03:10:20.609
THEY DEFORESTED TROPICAL

03:10:20.675 --> 03:10:22.644
RAINFOREST THAT WAS IN HIGH

03:10:22.711 --> 03:10:23.912
PEAT SOIL. SO SOILS THAT HAD A

03:10:23.979 --> 03:10:25.614
LOT OF CARBON STORED IN THEM.

03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:27.616
AND WHEN YOU DISTURB THAT SOIL,

03:10:27.682 --> 03:10:28.850
THAT CARBON DECOMPOSES THE THE

03:10:28.917 --> 03:10:29.785
NET EFFECT, ONCE YOU INCLUDE

03:10:29.851 --> 03:10:31.720
THE INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGES,

03:10:31.787 --> 03:10:32.554
THOSE FUELS WERE WORSE THAN

03:10:32.621 --> 03:10:35.490
THAN PETROLEUM. AND THAT WAS

03:10:35.557 --> 03:10:37.692
SORT OF AN EXAMPLE OF VERY BAD

03:10:37.759 --> 03:10:38.493
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY DESIGN.

03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:41.630
WHAT NOT TO DO IN THIS SPACE.

03:10:41.696 --> 03:10:43.665
NOW, TO BE CLEAR, I DON'T THINK

03:10:43.732 --> 03:10:45.667
THE, YOU KNOW, THE US BIOFUEL

03:10:45.734 --> 03:10:46.535
POLICIES ARE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT

03:10:46.601 --> 03:10:48.770
BAD RIGHT NOW, BUT IT IS A

03:10:48.837 --> 03:10:50.705
CONCERN THAT WE NEED TO BE

03:10:50.772 --> 03:10:53.575
AWARE OF. AND IF YOU HAVE

03:10:53.642 --> 03:10:54.810
POLICIES THAT, YOU KNOW, SORT

03:10:54.876 --> 03:10:56.411
OF HAVE A LOT MORE AGRICULTURAL

03:10:56.478 --> 03:10:57.746
COMMODITIES GOING INTO THE FUEL

03:10:57.813 --> 03:11:00.315
SYSTEM, ALL THE PEOPLE, ANIMALS,

03:11:00.382 --> 03:11:02.584
ETC. THAT WERE EATING, YOU KNOW,

03:11:02.651 --> 03:11:03.618
THOSE COMMODITIES OR

03:11:03.685 --> 03:11:04.085
SUBSTITUTES FOR THOSE

03:11:04.152 --> 03:11:05.821
COMMODITIES. THEY STILL HAVE TO

03:11:05.887 --> 03:11:06.822
BE FED. SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE IS

03:11:06.888 --> 03:11:08.857
GOING TO FIND A WAY TO FEED

03:11:08.924 --> 03:11:10.058
THEM. RIGHT. THERE'S NOW A

03:11:10.125 --> 03:11:11.760
MARKET DEMAND FOR THAT. IF THEY

03:11:11.827 --> 03:11:13.361
CLEAR LAND, WHICH IS ONE OF THE

03:11:13.428 --> 03:11:14.729
WAYS THAT THAT YOU CAN INCREASE

03:11:14.796 --> 03:11:15.864
DEMAND, THEN YOU GET THOSE

03:11:15.931 --> 03:11:16.998
INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGE

03:11:17.065 --> 03:11:18.500
OPTIONS. SO TO SOME EXTENT, YOU

03:11:18.567 --> 03:11:20.569
KNOW, YOU CAN IMPACT THE ACTUAL

03:11:20.635 --> 03:11:22.437
EFFECT OF LAND USE CHANGE BY

03:11:22.504 --> 03:11:25.040
TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, WORK WITH

03:11:25.106 --> 03:11:26.708
FARMERS AROUND THE WORLD TO USE

03:11:26.775 --> 03:11:27.475
MORE EFFICIENT CROPS, USE MORE

03:11:27.542 --> 03:11:29.010
EFFICIENT FERTILIZERS, GET MORE

03:11:29.077 --> 03:11:30.612
YIELD PER ACRE, SO YOU DON'T

03:11:30.679 --> 03:11:32.247
HAVE TO CLEAR MORE LAND. THAT

03:11:32.314 --> 03:11:33.048
CAN HELP. WORKING WITH

03:11:33.114 --> 03:11:34.983
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SENSITIVE

03:11:35.050 --> 03:11:37.219
LAND, YOU KNOW, SOUTHEAST ASIA,

03:11:37.285 --> 03:11:39.654
BRAZIL, OTHER AMAZON COUNTRIES

03:11:39.721 --> 03:11:40.822
TO TRY TO GIVE THEM MORE

03:11:40.889 --> 03:11:41.556
ABILITY TO PREVENT

03:11:41.623 --> 03:11:44.025
DEFORESTATION DIRECTLY CAN ALSO

03:11:44.092 --> 03:11:46.361
HELP. THOSE THINGS ARE LARGELY

03:11:46.428 --> 03:11:46.928
OUTSIDE OF OUR JURISDICTION,

03:11:46.995 --> 03:11:48.763
AND THAT DOES MAKE IT COMPLEX

03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:50.232
FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT WANT TO

03:11:50.298 --> 03:11:51.533
ADOPT FUEL POLICIES TO HAVE TO

03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:53.702
WORK, KNOWING THAT WE NEED TO

03:11:53.768 --> 03:11:54.870
PREVENT THIS SORT OF CAUSAL

03:11:54.936 --> 03:11:56.538
CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT IS

03:11:56.605 --> 03:11:58.206
INDIRECT AND SPANS THE GLOBE

03:11:58.273 --> 03:11:59.608
WHEN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CHAIN

03:11:59.674 --> 03:12:01.743
ARE JUST OUTSIDE OF OUR ABILITY

03:12:01.810 --> 03:12:03.511
TO INFLUENCE. AND THAT'S WHY I

03:12:03.578 --> 03:12:05.580
THINK YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

03:12:05.647 --> 03:12:06.882
AND I WOULD ARGUE, I THINK IT'S

03:12:06.948 --> 03:12:08.650
BETTER ON I LIKE TO ON THE SIDE

03:12:08.717 --> 03:12:11.319
OF CONSERVATISM, TO ON THE SIDE

03:12:11.386 --> 03:12:12.420
OF OVERESTIMATING ILUC IMPACTS,

03:12:12.487 --> 03:12:14.956
BECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT AND YOU

03:12:15.023 --> 03:12:15.924
USE TOO LITTLE BIOFUELS, THERE

03:12:15.991 --> 03:12:17.926
IS A REAL COST THERE, RIGHT?

03:12:17.993 --> 03:12:18.760
YOU ARE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY

03:12:18.827 --> 03:12:19.961
TO TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

03:12:20.028 --> 03:12:21.429
EMISSIONS. AND CLIMATE CHANGE

03:12:21.496 --> 03:12:23.531
IS A CRISIS. SO I DON'T WANT TO

03:12:23.598 --> 03:12:24.699
DOWNPLAY THAT COST TOO MUCH.

03:12:24.766 --> 03:12:26.868
BUT I THINK THE RISKS ON THE

03:12:26.935 --> 03:12:27.836
OTHER SIDE OF OF OVERCONSUMING

03:12:27.903 --> 03:12:29.671
BIOFUELS AND LEADING TO

03:12:29.738 --> 03:12:30.906
SOMETHING AKIN TO WHAT HAPPENED

03:12:30.972 --> 03:12:32.540
IN THE PAST, LEADING TO THE

03:12:32.607 --> 03:12:33.942
LOSS OF OF NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS

03:12:34.009 --> 03:12:35.543
AND THE LOSS OF SOIL CARBON,

03:12:35.610 --> 03:12:37.512
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT IT TAKES

03:12:37.579 --> 03:12:38.780
DECADES TO CENTURIES FOR CARBON

03:12:38.847 --> 03:12:40.482
TO ACCUMULATE BY NATURAL MEANS.

03:12:40.548 --> 03:12:42.651
I THINK THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW,

03:12:42.717 --> 03:12:44.286
ERRING ON THE SIDE OF BEING A

03:12:44.352 --> 03:12:44.719
LITTLE CONSERVATIVE,

03:12:44.786 --> 03:12:45.987
CONSERVATIVE, ERRING ON THE

03:12:46.054 --> 03:12:48.056
SIDE OF OVERESTIMATING ILUC IS

03:12:48.123 --> 03:12:50.558
THE SAFER CHOICE, AND ONE WE'RE

03:12:50.625 --> 03:12:51.826
LESS LIKELY TO REGRET IN THE

03:12:51.893 --> 03:12:53.528
FUTURE. AND IF I COULD JUST ADD,

03:12:53.595 --> 03:12:54.696
I, I WOULD AGREE WITH

03:12:54.763 --> 03:12:55.830
EVERYTHING COLLIN SAID. EXCEPT

03:12:55.897 --> 03:12:57.532
ONE THING I DO THINK US POLICY,

03:12:57.599 --> 03:12:59.601
IN FACT, IS IN A PLACE WHERE

03:12:59.668 --> 03:13:00.068
WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT

03:13:00.135 --> 03:13:00.869
DEFORESTATION EFFECTS IN THE

03:13:00.936 --> 03:13:02.570
WORLD AND THAT IN FACT, MANY OF

03:13:02.637 --> 03:13:04.673
WE MAY NOT HAVE REDUCED CARBON

03:13:04.739 --> 03:13:06.808
EMISSIONS VERY MUCH, IF AT ALL,

03:13:06.875 --> 03:13:07.509
FROM BIOFUELS. AND THAT'S

03:13:07.575 --> 03:13:08.777
THAT'S AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

03:13:08.843 --> 03:13:09.878
AND THE STATE. I WAS

03:13:09.945 --> 03:13:11.413
CONTRIBUTING TO THAT. AND IS

03:13:11.479 --> 03:13:12.647
THAT MORE ATTRIBUTED TO THE

03:13:12.714 --> 03:13:14.716
FEDS AND US POLICY VERSUS

03:13:14.783 --> 03:13:15.483
CALIFORNIA ONLY POLICY? AND

03:13:15.550 --> 03:13:16.851
THAT GETS TO THE ADDITIONALITY

03:13:16.918 --> 03:13:18.787
QUESTION. RIGHT. SO HOW MUCH OF

03:13:18.853 --> 03:13:19.754
THE ETHANOL, RENEWABLE DIESEL

03:13:19.821 --> 03:13:21.690
THAT WE SEE AND THAT WE'RE

03:13:21.756 --> 03:13:22.891
CONSUMING IN THIS STATE IN THE

03:13:22.958 --> 03:13:23.992
COUNTRY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

03:13:24.059 --> 03:13:24.759
ANYWAY, EVEN IF CALIFORNIA

03:13:24.826 --> 03:13:27.696
DIDN'T HAVE AN LCFS. AND SO AND

03:13:27.762 --> 03:13:28.530
THERE'S A BACKWARD LOOKING

03:13:28.596 --> 03:13:29.531
QUESTION AND THERE'S A FORWARD

03:13:29.597 --> 03:13:30.732
LOOKING QUESTION. AND SO, YOU

03:13:30.799 --> 03:13:32.767
KNOW, ETHANOL, I'D SAY

03:13:32.834 --> 03:13:33.368
CALIFORNIA IS NOT CONTRIBUTING

03:13:33.435 --> 03:13:34.703
TO THE EXPANSION OF THE AMOUNT

03:13:34.769 --> 03:13:36.671
OF ETHANOL WE'RE USING FOR

03:13:36.738 --> 03:13:37.939
RENEWABLE DIESEL. I THINK YOU

03:13:38.006 --> 03:13:41.042
CAN MAKE A CASE THAT, THAT THE

03:13:41.109 --> 03:13:43.511
RENEWABLE DIESEL INDUSTRY SORT

03:13:43.578 --> 03:13:44.813
OF THEY KNEW THAT THE FEDERAL

03:13:44.879 --> 03:13:46.548
STANDARD IS WRITTEN SO THAT THE

03:13:46.614 --> 03:13:49.617
THE FEDS WILL REQUIRE SOME

03:13:49.684 --> 03:13:50.819
NUMBER OF GALLONS. THAT'S,

03:13:50.885 --> 03:13:52.620
THAT'S THAT COMPORTS WITH

03:13:52.687 --> 03:13:53.788
AVAILABLE PRODUCTION CAPACITY.

03:13:53.855 --> 03:13:56.291
SO, SO I THINK YOU CAN TELL A

03:13:56.358 --> 03:13:57.559
STORY WHERE INDUSTRY SORT OF

03:13:57.625 --> 03:13:59.060
USED THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM AS

03:13:59.127 --> 03:13:59.928
A WAY TO BUILD OUT THIS

03:13:59.995 --> 03:14:01.496
CAPACITY, AND THEN THE FEDERAL

03:14:01.563 --> 03:14:02.697
GOVERNMENT STEPPED IN AND SAID,

03:14:02.764 --> 03:14:03.999
OKAY, NOW WE'RE GOING TO

03:14:04.065 --> 03:14:05.133
MANDATE THAT THAT CAPACITY GETS

03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:06.568
INCLUDED IN IN OUR FUEL.

03:14:06.634 --> 03:14:07.836
BECAUSE THE THING TO UNDERSTAND

03:14:07.902 --> 03:14:08.636
WITH DIESEL IS THAT RENEWABLE

03:14:08.703 --> 03:14:10.572
DIESEL IS ABOUT $2 A GALLON

03:14:10.638 --> 03:14:11.539
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PETROLEUM,

03:14:11.606 --> 03:14:12.841
SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE ANY

03:14:12.907 --> 03:14:14.876
OF IT UNLESS WE HAVE POLICY

03:14:14.943 --> 03:14:16.611
SUPPORT THROUGH THE FEDERAL

03:14:16.678 --> 03:14:18.346
PROGRAM, BUT ALSO THE STATE

03:14:18.413 --> 03:14:19.581
PROGRAM. YEAH, AND I THINK

03:14:19.647 --> 03:14:20.782
WE'RE SEEING REAL TIME EFFECTS

03:14:20.849 --> 03:14:23.518
OF THAT IN CALIFORNIA. I, I,

03:14:23.585 --> 03:14:25.687
LIKE MY COLLEAGUE, HAVE A LOT

03:14:25.754 --> 03:14:26.554
MORE QUESTIONS THAN CAN BE

03:14:26.621 --> 03:14:28.523
ANSWERED IN THIS TIME. SO I

03:14:28.590 --> 03:14:29.724
DEFINITELY WILL BE FOLLOWING UP

03:14:29.791 --> 03:14:31.393
TO DO THOSE. I'M LOOKING AT ALL

03:14:31.459 --> 03:14:33.528
MY NOTES, BUT I WILL I WANT TO

03:14:33.595 --> 03:14:34.529
DO WANT TO END WITH THIS

03:14:34.596 --> 03:14:35.930
QUESTION. AND AND IT'S BASED

03:14:35.997 --> 03:14:37.699
KIND OF ON THE SAME SECTION OF

03:14:37.766 --> 03:14:40.101
WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT I LIKE

03:14:40.168 --> 03:14:40.702
THE, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALL

03:14:40.769 --> 03:14:41.836
THESE THINGS THAT NEED

03:14:41.903 --> 03:14:42.904
ATTENTION AND WILL EVENTUALLY

03:14:42.971 --> 03:14:44.706
NEED ADJUSTMENTS OR WE WILL GET

03:14:44.773 --> 03:14:45.740
INTO A CRISIS. SO THIS QUESTION

03:14:45.807 --> 03:14:48.176
IS FOR EACH ONE OF YOU. IF YOU

03:14:48.243 --> 03:14:49.577
WANT TO ANSWER, WHAT DO YOU SEE

03:14:49.644 --> 03:14:50.712
AS AS THE DIFFERENCE IN

03:14:50.779 --> 03:14:51.913
ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND

03:14:51.980 --> 03:14:55.450
ISSUES AROUND LCFS AND AS A

03:14:55.517 --> 03:14:57.585
WHOLE, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

03:14:57.652 --> 03:15:00.555
THE RULEMAKING PROCESS AND THE

03:15:00.622 --> 03:15:01.756
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS? AND WHERE

03:15:01.823 --> 03:15:03.658
SHOULD SOME OF THESE THINGS BE

03:15:03.725 --> 03:15:06.828
ADDRESSED? IF YOU IF YOU WILL,

03:15:06.895 --> 03:15:08.530
YOU DON'T ALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT.

03:15:08.596 --> 03:15:10.698
BUT IF I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THE

03:15:10.765 --> 03:15:12.133
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, I WOULD

03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:13.601
SAY IT'S PROBABLY BETTER

03:15:13.668 --> 03:15:14.803
ADDRESSED AT THE RULEMAKING

03:15:14.869 --> 03:15:16.771
LEVEL JUST BECAUSE IT IS SO

03:15:16.838 --> 03:15:18.673
COMPLEX AND INFORMATION AND AND

03:15:18.740 --> 03:15:22.577
DATA DEPENDENT. I YOU KNOW, I

03:15:22.644 --> 03:15:24.846
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AND YOUR

03:15:24.913 --> 03:15:26.648
COLLEAGUES GET UP TO SPEED AND

03:15:26.714 --> 03:15:27.849
START LEARNING THIS DATA. AND

03:15:27.916 --> 03:15:29.851
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOU ON A

03:15:29.918 --> 03:15:30.518
WONDERFUL JOURNEY THROUGH

03:15:30.585 --> 03:15:32.253
MODELING AND HELP YOU

03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:32.821
UNDERSTAND ALL THIS STUFF.

03:15:32.887 --> 03:15:34.556
YOU'VE GOT A BUSY JOB. I DON'T

03:15:34.622 --> 03:15:36.624
THINK YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF

03:15:36.691 --> 03:15:38.726
FREE TIME, SORT OF, YOU KNOW,

03:15:38.793 --> 03:15:39.794
BURNING A HOLE ON ON YOUR

03:15:39.861 --> 03:15:41.696
CALENDAR RIGHT NOW. SO I THINK

03:15:41.763 --> 03:15:42.831
BECAUSE OF THE THE COMPLEX

03:15:42.897 --> 03:15:44.499
TECHNICAL NATURE OF THIS AND

03:15:44.566 --> 03:15:45.667
BECAUSE OF THE DATA

03:15:45.733 --> 03:15:46.701
DEPENDENCIES, BECAUSE OF THE

03:15:46.768 --> 03:15:48.436
FACT THAT SO MUCH OF THIS CAN

03:15:48.503 --> 03:15:49.537
ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD THROUGH

03:15:49.604 --> 03:15:50.705
MODELS. AND, YOU KNOW, THE

03:15:50.772 --> 03:15:51.706
MODELS ARE UNCERTAIN, AND YOU

03:15:51.773 --> 03:15:53.975
HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT WHEN

03:15:54.042 --> 03:15:54.776
YOU INTERPRET MODELING RESULTS.

03:15:54.843 --> 03:15:57.112
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY BETTER

03:15:57.178 --> 03:15:57.679
LEFT TO AGENCIES WHERE THEY

03:15:57.745 --> 03:15:59.614
HAVE A LOT OF SPECIALIZED

03:15:59.681 --> 03:16:01.716
EXPERTISE AND MODELING CAPACITY.

03:16:01.783 --> 03:16:02.517
OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS AN

03:16:02.584 --> 03:16:03.718
OVERSIGHT ROLE THAT THE

03:16:03.785 --> 03:16:05.887
LEGISLATURE CAN AND SHOULD

03:16:05.954 --> 03:16:08.957
CONTINUE TO TO FULFILL. BUT

03:16:09.023 --> 03:16:11.493
YEAH, AND TO THAT, I WOULD ADD

03:16:11.559 --> 03:16:13.728
THAT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE

03:16:13.795 --> 03:16:14.696
RIGHT QUESTIONS. SO HOW MUCH IS

03:16:14.762 --> 03:16:16.998
THIS COSTING US, AND WHAT IS

03:16:17.065 --> 03:16:18.666
THE BENEFIT FOR THE PEOPLE OF

03:16:18.733 --> 03:16:19.634
THE STATE? AND I THINK YOU

03:16:19.701 --> 03:16:21.202
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY KEEP ASKING

03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:22.737
THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE, YOU

03:16:22.804 --> 03:16:26.107
KNOW, WE HAVE WE HAVE LAWS PUT

03:16:26.174 --> 03:16:27.809
IN PLACE AND THEN WE HAVE CARB

03:16:27.876 --> 03:16:29.010
DOING THEIR BEST TO IMPLEMENT

03:16:29.077 --> 03:16:30.645
THOSE. AND SOMETIMES, EVEN IF

03:16:30.712 --> 03:16:32.847
IT'S THE LOWEST COST REGULATION

03:16:32.914 --> 03:16:35.550
THAT GOES INTO PLACE, MAYBE YOU

03:16:35.617 --> 03:16:36.885
LOOK AT IT LATER AND YOU SAY,

03:16:36.951 --> 03:16:38.586
YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT WORTH IT

03:16:38.653 --> 03:16:41.089
FOR US, OR IT IS WORTH IT FOR

03:16:41.156 --> 03:16:43.391
US, WE SHOULD DO MORE. SO I

03:16:43.458 --> 03:16:43.992
THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT

03:16:44.058 --> 03:16:45.693
QUESTIONS. I WOULD JUST AGREE

03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:47.896
WITH THOSE COMMENTS AND SAY, I

03:16:47.962 --> 03:16:49.697
THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

03:16:49.764 --> 03:16:51.366
HAPPY TO ALSO HELP ON THE

03:16:51.432 --> 03:16:52.567
EDUCATION SIDE BECAUSE I THINK

03:16:52.634 --> 03:16:55.003
THAT REALLY IS THE KEY THING. I

03:16:55.069 --> 03:16:55.436
MEAN, IT'S IT'S VERY

03:16:55.503 --> 03:16:57.405
COMPLICATED, BUT IT IS

03:16:57.472 --> 03:16:58.706
UNDERSTANDABLE AND IT'S

03:16:58.773 --> 03:17:02.577
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT IT IN A

03:17:02.644 --> 03:17:04.379
CLEAR EYED WAY AND REALLY

03:17:04.445 --> 03:17:05.213
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.

03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:06.748

03:17:12.854 --> 03:17:14.489
INFORMATIVE, AND YOU DID A

03:17:14.556 --> 03:17:15.557

THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

03:17:32.574 --> 03:17:34.642
NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO

03:17:34.709 --> 03:17:38.112
OUR FINAL PANEL, WHICH IS OUR

03:17:38.179 --> 03:17:39.714
STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES.

03:17:39.781 --> 03:17:41.883
THEY'VE ALL BEEN GIVEN A SHORT

03:17:41.950 --> 03:17:43.618
AMOUNT OF TIME. AND SO WE'RE

03:17:43.685 --> 03:17:45.286
GOING TO CALL THEM UP. AND

THEY'LL GO IN THE ORDER THAT

03:17:46.721 --> 03:17:49.724
THEY ARE AWARE OF. WE WILL ALSO

03:17:49.791 --> 03:17:51.993
STILL MAKE THEM MAKE THEMSELVES.

03:17:52.060 --> 03:17:52.560
THEY'VE ALL MADE THEMSELVES

03:17:52.627 --> 03:17:53.895
AVAILABLE FOR THE PANEL FOR ANY.

03:17:53.962 --> 03:17:55.496
I'M SORRY FOR THE MEMBERS TO

03:18:48.750 --> 03:18:49.517
AVAILABLE, YOU CAN COME UP. WE

03:18:49.584 --> 03:18:51.619
CAN ALSO GET ANOTHER CHAIR, BUT

03:18:51.686 --> 03:18:53.254
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY MIKES, BUT

03:18:53.321 --> 03:18:54.455
WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT. THERE IS

03:18:54.522 --> 03:18:55.723
ANOTHER ONE. OKAY. MAKE SURE

03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:57.725
BECAUSE I LISTED YOU ALL AT

FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH

03:19:05.667 --> 03:19:06.901
YOU TODAY. I'M SAM WADE, VICE

03:19:06.968 --> 03:19:08.136
PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY WITH

03:19:08.202 --> 03:19:09.637
THE RNG COALITION. WE REPRESENT

03:19:09.704 --> 03:19:11.205
APPROXIMATELY 400 MEMBER

03:19:11.272 --> 03:19:12.206
COMPANIES, AND WE'RE WORKING

03:19:12.273 --> 03:19:13.074
TOWARD A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR

03:19:13.141 --> 03:19:14.842
RENEWABLE GAS. THE LOW CARBON

03:19:14.909 --> 03:19:16.411
FUEL STANDARD IS A COST

03:19:16.477 --> 03:19:17.512
EFFECTIVE METHOD OF MEETING OUR

03:19:17.578 --> 03:19:18.746
GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS. AS YOU'VE

03:19:18.813 --> 03:19:19.781
ALREADY HEARD TODAY, THE

03:19:19.847 --> 03:19:20.915
PROGRAM WORKED WELL

03:19:20.982 --> 03:19:21.482
HISTORICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS

03:19:21.549 --> 03:19:22.684
TECHNOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL,

03:19:22.750 --> 03:19:24.786
GEOGRAPHICALLY FLEXIBLE, AND

03:19:24.852 --> 03:19:26.487
OPEN TO PRIVATE SECTOR

03:19:26.554 --> 03:19:27.922
INNOVATION THAT HELPED DELIVER

03:19:27.989 --> 03:19:28.723
THE CLEANEST FUELS AT THE

03:19:28.790 --> 03:19:30.758
LOWEST COST TO CALIFORNIANS.

03:19:30.825 --> 03:19:31.693
BECAUSE OF THE LCFS, RNG GROWTH

03:19:31.759 --> 03:19:33.628
IN CALIFORNIA OCCURRED RAPIDLY

03:19:33.695 --> 03:19:35.563
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE NOW

03:19:35.630 --> 03:19:37.765
HAVE THE GREATEST TOTAL NUMBER

03:19:37.832 --> 03:19:39.367
OF RNG PROJECTS IN THE STATE OR

03:19:39.434 --> 03:19:41.669
SORRY, OF ANY STATE. WE HAVE

03:19:41.736 --> 03:19:43.438
225 PROJECTS ACROSS FOOD, WASTE,

03:19:43.504 --> 03:19:44.906
DIVERSION, LANDFILL WASTE,

03:19:44.972 --> 03:19:46.674
WATER AND AGRICULTURAL

03:19:46.741 --> 03:19:47.542
ACTIVITIES. THE HIGHEST NUMBER

03:19:47.608 --> 03:19:49.610
OF R&amp;D PROJECTS ARE IN THE

03:19:49.677 --> 03:19:52.213
DAIRY SPACE. WE HAVE 168 DAIRY

03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:52.747
DIGESTERS IN OPERATION IN

03:19:52.814 --> 03:19:54.982
CALIFORNIA, WITH ANOTHER 75 IN

03:19:55.049 --> 03:19:55.750
DEVELOPMENT. MOST OF THESE

03:19:55.817 --> 03:19:57.652
PROJECTS MAKE RNG FOR NATURAL

03:19:57.719 --> 03:20:00.221
GAS TRUCKS, BUT SOME MAKE

03:20:00.288 --> 03:20:01.389
ELECTRICITY OR HYDROGEN. SO

03:20:01.456 --> 03:20:03.558
WHILE WE HAVE THE THE MOST RNG

03:20:03.624 --> 03:20:05.660
PROJECTS OF ANY STATE, AS I

03:20:05.727 --> 03:20:07.061
SAID, WE DO STILL RELY ON

03:20:07.128 --> 03:20:08.696
IMPORTS TO HELP MEET TOTAL

03:20:08.763 --> 03:20:09.897
DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS, VEHICLE

03:20:09.964 --> 03:20:11.699
FUEL AND GROWING DEMAND FOR

03:20:11.766 --> 03:20:13.701
OTHER FUELS THAT CAN BE MADE

03:20:13.768 --> 03:20:15.603
FROM RNG. AND THESE IMPORTED

03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:17.839
FUELS DO STILL DELIVER IN-STATE

03:20:17.905 --> 03:20:19.374
AIR QUALITY BENEFITS AS THEY'RE

03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:20.608
USED IN CLEAN VEHICLES, AS YOU

03:20:20.675 --> 03:20:22.977
HEARD EARLIER, AND DISPLACING

03:20:23.044 --> 03:20:24.479
ONE AGING DIESEL TRUCK WITH A

03:20:24.545 --> 03:20:26.614
NEW RNG TRUCK CREATES THE SAME

03:20:26.681 --> 03:20:27.482
AIR QUALITY BENEFITS AS TAKING

03:20:27.548 --> 03:20:30.785
119 CARS OFF THE ROAD. IMPORTED

03:20:30.852 --> 03:20:31.919
RNG OCCURS FOR THE SAME REASON

03:20:31.986 --> 03:20:33.855
THAT CALIFORNIA IMPORTS ANY

03:20:33.921 --> 03:20:34.989
FUEL IMPORT. COMPETITION KEEPS

03:20:35.056 --> 03:20:36.391
COSTS LOWER FOR THE TRUCKING

03:20:36.457 --> 03:20:38.860
FLEETS USING RNG, AND THEREFORE

03:20:38.926 --> 03:20:39.827
LOWERS THE COST TO CONSUMERS OF

03:20:39.894 --> 03:20:41.863
GOODS MOVED USING THOSE BY

03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:43.765
THOSE FLEETS. THE IN-STATE

03:20:43.831 --> 03:20:45.666
PRODUCTION SHARE FOR RNG IS

03:20:45.733 --> 03:20:47.568
GROWING EVERY YEAR AND IS NOW

03:20:47.635 --> 03:20:49.170
HIGHER THAN FOR THE FOSSIL

03:20:49.237 --> 03:20:51.439
FUELS WE DISPLACE. IN 2024, 23%

03:20:51.506 --> 03:20:53.941
OF OUR ENERGY SUPPLY CAME FROM

03:20:54.008 --> 03:20:55.109
CALIFORNIA PROJECTS, UP FROM

03:20:55.176 --> 03:20:58.980
ONLY 7% IN 2021. AND BY FOR

03:20:59.046 --> 03:20:59.747
COMPARISON, CALIFORNIA PRODUCES

03:20:59.814 --> 03:21:01.516
ONLY 10% OF THE FOSSIL NATURAL

03:21:01.582 --> 03:21:04.118
GAS WE USE AND ROUGHLY 23% OF

03:21:04.185 --> 03:21:05.453
THE OIL WE USE TO MAKE

03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:07.455
CONVENTIONAL DIESEL. AS YOU

03:21:07.522 --> 03:21:09.490
ALSO HEARD FROM CARB EARLIER,

03:21:09.557 --> 03:21:10.758
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATES

03:21:10.825 --> 03:21:11.926
WORKING TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA ON

03:21:11.993 --> 03:21:15.496
LCFS. AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

03:21:15.563 --> 03:21:18.466
REALLY BEING DRIVEN BY THE SAME

03:21:18.533 --> 03:21:19.667
ENTITIES THAT HAVE SERVED

03:21:19.734 --> 03:21:21.769
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM OVER TIME.

03:21:21.836 --> 03:21:23.571
SO BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE

03:21:23.638 --> 03:21:24.839
IMPORTS IN THE PROGRAM, STILL,

03:21:24.906 --> 03:21:26.707
YOU ALSO RECEIVE THE CLIMATE

03:21:26.774 --> 03:21:27.408
LEADERSHIP BENEFIT ASSOCIATED

03:21:27.475 --> 03:21:30.711
WITH MOTIVATING OTHERS TO ACT.

03:21:30.778 --> 03:21:31.612
SO WE RECOMMEND AGAINST ANY

03:21:31.679 --> 03:21:34.215
FURTHER MAJOR LCFS PROGRAMMATIC

03:21:34.282 --> 03:21:34.816
CHANGES AT THIS TIME, I THINK

03:21:34.882 --> 03:21:36.584
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A SIMILAR

03:21:36.651 --> 03:21:37.718
THEME FROM SOME OF THE OTHER

03:21:37.785 --> 03:21:39.821
CLEAN FUEL VOICES UP HERE TODAY.

03:21:39.887 --> 03:21:40.588
THE RECENT UNCERTAINTY CREATED

03:21:40.655 --> 03:21:41.722
BY MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OF

03:21:41.789 --> 03:21:44.025
DELIBERATIONS AT CARB AND IN

03:21:44.091 --> 03:21:45.393
LEGISLATIVE CONVERSATIONS HAS

03:21:45.460 --> 03:21:46.861
UNDERMINED BASICALLY THE

03:21:46.928 --> 03:21:48.162
INVESTMENT THESIS FOR PRIVATE

03:21:48.229 --> 03:21:50.965
CAPITAL, TRYING TO BE HELPFUL

03:21:51.032 --> 03:21:51.866
IN ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S GOALS

03:21:51.933 --> 03:21:53.901
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. AND SO WE

03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:55.736
NEED TO FOCUS ON STABILIZING

03:21:55.803 --> 03:21:56.804
INCENTIVES TO INVEST IN CLIMATE

03:21:56.871 --> 03:21:58.940
ACTION AND FULLY EMBRACE THE

03:21:59.006 --> 03:22:00.842
LCFS AS A KEY TOOL TO DO THAT.

03:22:00.908 --> 03:22:02.510
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD

03:22:02.577 --> 03:22:03.644
AFTERNOON. I'M MICHAEL

03:22:03.711 --> 03:22:05.980
BOCCADORO, AND I WORK CLOSELY

03:22:06.047 --> 03:22:06.814
WITH THE STATE'S AG SECTOR AND

03:22:06.881 --> 03:22:08.082
THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHANE

03:22:08.149 --> 03:22:10.151
REDUCTION EFFORTS ON THE

03:22:10.218 --> 03:22:10.885
STATE'S FAMILY DAIRY FARMS. I

03:22:10.952 --> 03:22:12.453
WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH TWO

03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:14.755
IMPORTANT POINTS TODAY. FIRST,

03:22:14.822 --> 03:22:16.257
CLIMATE SCIENTISTS AGREE THAT

03:22:16.324 --> 03:22:17.492
REDUCTION OF METHANE IS THE

03:22:17.558 --> 03:22:19.961
MOST IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL

03:22:20.027 --> 03:22:21.462
SHORT TERM ACTION TO LIMIT

03:22:21.529 --> 03:22:23.965
LIMIT GLOBAL WARMING AND

03:22:24.031 --> 03:22:25.433
CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SECONDLY,

03:22:25.500 --> 03:22:26.701
DAIRY METHANE REDUCTION IS

03:22:26.767 --> 03:22:28.769
HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA, IN

03:22:28.836 --> 03:22:29.937
LARGE PART DUE TO THE SUCCESS

03:22:30.004 --> 03:22:32.673
OF THE LCFS PROGRAM. AND AS A

03:22:32.740 --> 03:22:34.775
RESULT, THE DAIRY SECTOR IS ON

03:22:34.842 --> 03:22:36.944
PATH TO ACHIEVING A FULL 40%

03:22:37.011 --> 03:22:39.046
REDUCTION IN METHANE BY 2030.

03:22:39.113 --> 03:22:40.615
CONSISTENT WITH STATE GOALS.

03:22:40.681 --> 03:22:42.884
THE DAIRY SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA

03:22:42.950 --> 03:22:43.885
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A MAJOR

03:22:43.951 --> 03:22:45.453
MILESTONE IN ACHIEVING 5

03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:47.755
MILLION METRIC TONS OF METHANE

03:22:47.822 --> 03:22:49.490
REDUCTION AS CO2 Â ANNUALLY.

03:22:49.557 --> 03:22:51.626
THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF

03:22:51.692 --> 03:22:52.627
REMARKABLE AND A MAJOR BRIGHT

03:22:52.693 --> 03:22:54.996
SPOT IN THE STATE'S GLOBAL

03:22:55.062 --> 03:22:56.163
CLIMATE. LEADERSHIP. NO OTHER

03:22:56.230 --> 03:22:58.599
JURISDICTION IN THE U.S. OR THE

03:22:58.666 --> 03:22:59.800
WORLD IS EVEN CLOSE TO

03:22:59.867 --> 03:23:02.470
ACHIEVING A 40% REDUCTION. NONE

03:23:02.537 --> 03:23:04.705
OF THIS HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT.

03:23:04.772 --> 03:23:05.506
IT HAPPENED AS PART OF A

03:23:05.573 --> 03:23:07.575
COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY SET IN

03:23:07.642 --> 03:23:10.144
MOTION BY THE LEGISLATURE'S

03:23:10.211 --> 03:23:10.878
ADOPTION OF SENATE BILL 1383

03:23:10.945 --> 03:23:14.015
LARA IN 2016, CREATING THE

03:23:14.081 --> 03:23:14.582
STATE'S SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

03:23:14.649 --> 03:23:18.052
POLLUTION PROGRAM. SB 1383 WAS

03:23:18.119 --> 03:23:19.854
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE STATE'S

03:23:19.921 --> 03:23:20.655
APPROACH TO DAIRY METHANE

03:23:20.721 --> 03:23:22.790
REDUCTION, ADOPTING A MARKET

03:23:22.857 --> 03:23:26.160
BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAM BEFORE

03:23:26.227 --> 03:23:28.129
ANY DIRECT REGULATION. AND IT

03:23:28.195 --> 03:23:29.430
HAS WORKED AS DESIGNED, AND THE

03:23:29.497 --> 03:23:31.399
REDUCTIONS ARE BEING ACHIEVED

03:23:31.465 --> 03:23:33.034
WITHOUT WREAKING HAVOC ON THE

03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:34.902
STATE'S DAIRY FAMILIES AND

03:23:34.969 --> 03:23:37.271
WITHOUT CAUSING SIGNIFICANT

03:23:37.338 --> 03:23:38.573
EMISSIONS LEAKAGE TO OTHER

03:23:38.639 --> 03:23:40.641
STATES. THOSE WERE TWO VERY

03:23:40.708 --> 03:23:41.409
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS CONSIDERED

03:23:41.475 --> 03:23:44.946
IN 2016. THE LEGISLATURE

03:23:45.012 --> 03:23:45.713
CORRECTLY RECOGNIZED AND

03:23:45.780 --> 03:23:46.547
INCENTIVES WERE A BETTER

03:23:46.614 --> 03:23:48.783
APPROACH IN THE FARMING SECTOR

03:23:48.849 --> 03:23:50.985
DUE TO THE FACT THAT FARMS, AS

03:23:51.052 --> 03:23:52.520
PRICE TAKERS, CANNOT PASS ON

03:23:52.587 --> 03:23:54.422
THE COST OF CLIMATE AND OTHER

03:23:54.488 --> 03:23:56.023
REGULATORY PROGRAMS. SB 1383

03:23:56.090 --> 03:23:58.993
WAS VERY CLEAR. IT REQUIRED THE

03:23:59.060 --> 03:24:00.428
CPUC TO ESTABLISH AND FUND

03:24:00.494 --> 03:24:03.664
DAIRY BIO METHANE PROJECTS. IT

03:24:03.731 --> 03:24:04.899
REQUIRED CARB TO PROVIDE A

03:24:04.966 --> 03:24:06.601
PATHWAY FOR DAIRY PROJECTS.

03:24:06.667 --> 03:24:09.470
UNDER THE LCFS, IT REQUIRED THE

03:24:09.537 --> 03:24:11.606
CDC TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT

03:24:11.672 --> 03:24:12.807
STRATEGIES FOR RENEWABLE GAS TO

03:24:12.873 --> 03:24:14.075
ACHIEVE THE STATE'S CLIMATE

03:24:14.141 --> 03:24:15.543
GOALS, AND REQUIRED ALL

03:24:15.610 --> 03:24:17.411
AGENCIES TO CONSIDER AND ADOPT

03:24:17.478 --> 03:24:19.614
POLICIES AND INCENTIVES TO

03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:20.781
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE

03:24:20.848 --> 03:24:22.850
SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND USE

03:24:22.917 --> 03:24:25.553
OF RENEWABLE GAS. FINALLY, SB

03:24:25.620 --> 03:24:27.388
1383 DIRECTED STATE AGENCIES TO

03:24:27.455 --> 03:24:30.091
GIVE PRIORITY TO FUELS WITH THE

03:24:30.157 --> 03:24:30.891
GREATEST GREENHOUSE GAS

03:24:30.958 --> 03:24:33.561
EMISSION BENEFITS, INCLUDING

03:24:33.628 --> 03:24:34.829
CONSIDERATION OF CARBON

03:24:34.895 --> 03:24:35.863
INTENSITY AND REDUCTION IN

03:24:35.930 --> 03:24:37.698
SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS

03:24:37.765 --> 03:24:41.535
I.E. METHANE OR RNG. AS A

03:24:41.602 --> 03:24:43.571
RESULT, AS SAM SAID, WE HAVE

03:24:43.638 --> 03:24:44.872
168 OPERATING DAIRY DIGESTERS

03:24:44.939 --> 03:24:47.208
IN CALIFORNIA, WITH PLANS TO

03:24:47.274 --> 03:24:48.809
BUILD ANOTHER 60 TO 70 BY 2030.

03:24:48.876 --> 03:24:50.544
WITH THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF

03:24:50.611 --> 03:24:53.347
THE LCFS PROGRAM AND CONTINUED

03:24:53.414 --> 03:24:53.914
INCENTIVES, POLICYMAKERS CAN

03:24:53.981 --> 03:24:56.117
ENSURE THE STATE ACHIEVES THE

03:24:56.183 --> 03:24:58.019
FULL 40% REDUCTION IN DAIRY

03:24:58.085 --> 03:24:59.553
METHANE BY 2030. LET ME JUST

03:24:59.620 --> 03:25:02.456
CLOSE BY SAYING MANURE HAPPENS,

03:25:02.523 --> 03:25:04.625
AND THE LEGISLATURE AND CARB

03:25:04.692 --> 03:25:06.661
HAVE HAD THE FORESIGHT TO MAKE

03:25:06.727 --> 03:25:09.664
THE MOST OF IT. ONE MIGHT SAY

03:25:09.730 --> 03:25:14.135
IT'S UTTERLY REMARKABLE. BUT GO

03:25:14.201 --> 03:25:17.405
AHEAD. THANK YOU. GOOD

03:25:17.471 --> 03:25:22.076
AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON. IS

03:25:22.143 --> 03:25:24.645
THAT ON? OKAY, OKAY. MY NAME IS

03:25:24.712 --> 03:25:27.548
MARY SELECKY. I'M WITH AGW.

03:25:27.615 --> 03:25:28.716
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE

03:25:28.783 --> 03:25:30.584
TODAY. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT

03:25:30.651 --> 03:25:33.120
THE ROLE OF LIQUID BIOFUELS

03:25:33.187 --> 03:25:35.056
WITHIN THE LCFS AND ITS

03:25:35.122 --> 03:25:36.557
AFFORDABILITY IMPLICATIONS. SO

03:25:36.624 --> 03:25:38.893
I'D LIKE TO ZOOM OUT A BIT AND

03:25:38.959 --> 03:25:40.628
TALK, GIVE YOU THAT BIGGER

03:25:40.695 --> 03:25:42.663
PICTURE. LOOK AT HOW

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:43.531
ALTERNATIVE FUELS ALL PLAY A

03:25:43.597 --> 03:25:45.533
ROLE IN REPLACING CONVENTIONAL

03:25:45.599 --> 03:25:48.736
FUELS. THE LIQUID ALTERNATIVES

03:25:48.803 --> 03:25:50.871
INCLUDE BIODIESEL, RENEWABLE

03:25:50.938 --> 03:25:52.440
DIESEL, SUSTAINABLE AVIATION

03:25:52.506 --> 03:25:55.676
FUEL, ETHANOL, METHANOL, DME,

03:25:55.743 --> 03:25:58.546
AND MORE. ALL OF THESE CAN BE

03:25:58.612 --> 03:26:00.614
AND ARE MADE AT COMMERCIAL

03:26:00.681 --> 03:26:02.683
LEVELS, EITHER IN CALIFORNIA OR

03:26:02.750 --> 03:26:07.121
AT LEAST DOMESTICALLY. WHILE

03:26:07.188 --> 03:26:08.756
CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG TERM

03:26:08.823 --> 03:26:11.459
VISION OF ELECTRIFICATION, MOST

03:26:11.525 --> 03:26:13.661
DRIVERS TODAY STILL DRIVE CARS

03:26:13.728 --> 03:26:14.962
THAT USE SOME TYPE OF LIQUID

03:26:15.029 --> 03:26:17.665
FUEL. AS YOU KNOW, NOT ALL

03:26:17.732 --> 03:26:18.632
CALIFORNIA DRIVERS CAN AFFORD

03:26:18.699 --> 03:26:21.535
TO PURCHASE AN EV. AND SO WHAT

03:26:21.602 --> 03:26:23.237
THE LCFS DOES IS ENCOURAGE

03:26:23.304 --> 03:26:24.538
ALTERNATIVES THAT GIVE

03:26:24.605 --> 03:26:27.108
DECARBONIZATION VALUE TODAY AND

03:26:27.174 --> 03:26:28.743
ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONTINUE USING

03:26:28.809 --> 03:26:30.611
THEIR SAME VEHICLE. THESE

03:26:30.678 --> 03:26:32.713
ALTERNATIVES ALSO INTRODUCE

03:26:32.780 --> 03:26:34.482
COMPETITION, BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

03:26:34.548 --> 03:26:35.850
THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS ALL

03:26:35.916 --> 03:26:38.452
ABOUT. WE KNOW THAT COMPETITION

03:26:38.519 --> 03:26:40.755
CREATES BETTER PRICES. I TOOK

03:26:40.821 --> 03:26:42.490
THIS PICTURE OF A PROPEL

03:26:42.556 --> 03:26:44.692
STATION YESTERDAY IN SAN JOSE,

03:26:44.759 --> 03:26:47.027
WHERE E85 AND RENEWABLE DIESEL

03:26:47.094 --> 03:26:49.597
ARE BEING SOLD AT A SUBSTANTIAL

03:26:49.663 --> 03:26:51.432
DISCOUNT. YOU CAN SEE THAT IN

03:26:51.499 --> 03:26:54.068
THAT LOWER PART THERE, COMPARED

03:26:54.135 --> 03:26:57.538
TO THE CONVENTIONAL FUEL

03:26:57.605 --> 03:26:59.573
COUNTERPARTS. THEY'RE SAVING

03:26:59.640 --> 03:27:02.610
AROUND A DOLLAR A GALLON AND

03:27:02.676 --> 03:27:04.578
COST SAVINGS. THAT WAS

03:27:04.645 --> 03:27:09.416
YESTERDAY. WHILE LIQUID

03:27:09.483 --> 03:27:10.751
RENEWABLE FUELS PROVIDE

03:27:10.818 --> 03:27:12.887
IMMEDIATE WAYS TO DECARBONIZE,

03:27:12.953 --> 03:27:14.455
THEY ALSO HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY

03:27:14.522 --> 03:27:15.656
AS THE STATE MOVES TOWARD

03:27:15.723 --> 03:27:17.992
GREATER VOLUMES OF

03:27:18.058 --> 03:27:18.626
ELECTRIFICATION. MOST COMPANIES

03:27:18.692 --> 03:27:20.628
THAT PRODUCE THESE LIQUID FUELS

03:27:20.694 --> 03:27:21.929
HAVE LONG TERM BUSINESS PLANS

03:27:21.996 --> 03:27:23.564
THAT INVOLVE SHIFTING TOWARD

03:27:23.631 --> 03:27:27.334
HEAVY DUTY USES LIKE MARINE,

03:27:27.401 --> 03:27:29.603
AVIATION AND LOCOMOTIVE, WHERE

03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:32.439
ELECTRIFICATION IS MUCH HARDER.

03:27:32.506 --> 03:27:34.642
MATCHING ENERGY DENSE LIQUID

03:27:34.708 --> 03:27:36.377
FUELS WITH HIGHER ENERGY

03:27:36.443 --> 03:27:38.646
INTENSE NEEDS MAKES SENSE,

03:27:38.712 --> 03:27:40.414
SINCE LIGHTER DUTY NEEDS CAN BE

03:27:40.481 --> 03:27:42.583
READILY MET USING BATTERIES.

03:27:42.650 --> 03:27:44.852
LUCKILY, THE LCFS IS DESIGNED

03:27:44.919 --> 03:27:47.087
TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS. IT'S

03:27:47.154 --> 03:27:48.689
DESIGNED TO INTRODUCE

03:27:48.756 --> 03:27:50.491
COMPETITION INTO THE MARKET,

03:27:50.558 --> 03:27:52.726
REWARD IMMEDIATE

03:27:52.793 --> 03:27:53.460
DECARBONIZATION WITHOUT

03:27:53.527 --> 03:27:55.596
DICTATING MARKET CHOICES, AND

03:27:55.663 --> 03:27:58.432
THIRD, CREATE A BRIDGE TOWARD

03:27:58.499 --> 03:28:00.768
LONGER TERM MARKETS. THANK YOU

03:28:00.835 --> 03:28:04.205
FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

03:28:04.271 --> 03:28:06.640
CHAIRS AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS

03:28:06.707 --> 03:28:07.474
MICHAEL SKVARLA. I'M HERE ON

03:28:07.541 --> 03:28:09.343
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

03:28:09.410 --> 03:28:10.044
HYDROGEN COALITION.

03:28:10.110 --> 03:28:11.579
CALIFORNIA'S LCFS HAS BEEN

03:28:11.645 --> 03:28:13.948
ESSENTIAL TO MAKING HYDROGEN A

03:28:14.014 --> 03:28:15.282
REAL OPTION IN OUR

03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.916
TRANSPORTATION FUTURE. IT'S ONE

03:28:15.983 --> 03:28:17.685
OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL ELEMENTS

03:28:17.751 --> 03:28:20.020
OF THE LCFS IS THE

03:28:20.087 --> 03:28:21.322
INFRASTRUCTURE CREDITS, BOTH

03:28:21.388 --> 03:28:24.625
FOR HYDROGEN AND FAST CHARGING.

03:28:24.692 --> 03:28:25.192
WITHOUT THESE INFRASTRUCTURE

03:28:25.259 --> 03:28:26.894
CREDITS, CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT

03:28:26.961 --> 03:28:28.329
HAVE BUILT THE INITIAL BACKBONE

03:28:28.395 --> 03:28:29.230
OF HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS

03:28:29.296 --> 03:28:30.831
THAT SUPPORT THOUSANDS OF

03:28:30.898 --> 03:28:31.665
VEHICLES TODAY, AND MOST

03:28:31.732 --> 03:28:34.034
RECENTLY, THE UPDATES POSITION

03:28:34.101 --> 03:28:34.635
OURSELVES TO SERVE THE MEDIUM

03:28:34.702 --> 03:28:36.604
AND HEAVY DUTY SECTORS MOVING

03:28:36.670 --> 03:28:37.872
FORWARD. THE INFRASTRUCTURE

03:28:37.938 --> 03:28:40.574
PATHWAY IS UNIQUE AND IS BEING

03:28:40.641 --> 03:28:43.744
MODELED BY OTHER STATES AS THEY

03:28:43.811 --> 03:28:44.578
PURSUE CLEAN FUEL STANDARDS AND

03:28:44.645 --> 03:28:47.715
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS. THIS

03:28:47.781 --> 03:28:48.616
ALLOWS STATIONS TO BE FINANCED

03:28:48.682 --> 03:28:50.651
AND BUILT AHEAD OF DEMAND,

03:28:50.718 --> 03:28:51.719
ESSENTIALLY SOLVING FOR THE

03:28:51.785 --> 03:28:54.288
CHICKEN OR EGG PROBLEM. IT'S

03:28:54.355 --> 03:28:58.559
THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG. IT'S

03:28:58.626 --> 03:28:59.927
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CREDITS

03:28:59.994 --> 03:29:01.462
ARE GENERATED AT THE NOZZLE OR

03:29:01.528 --> 03:29:02.696
THE PLUG, MEANING THE BENEFITS

03:29:02.763 --> 03:29:04.665
ARE ACCRUED AT THE STATE LEVEL

03:29:04.732 --> 03:29:05.933
IN OUR COMMUNITIES, BOTH FOR

03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:06.700
MOLECULES AND ELECTRONS, FOR

03:29:06.767 --> 03:29:09.370
THE CARS, TRUCKS, AND BUSSES OF

03:29:09.436 --> 03:29:11.238
THE FUTURE. IMPORTANTLY, THESE

03:29:11.305 --> 03:29:13.340
BENEFITS ARE ACCRUING HERE AT

03:29:13.407 --> 03:29:16.577
HOME FOR CLEANER AIR FOR FOLKS

03:29:16.644 --> 03:29:18.178
WHO ARE LIVING NEAR PORTS,

03:29:18.245 --> 03:29:20.281
ALONG FREEWAYS, IN THE FREIGHT

03:29:20.347 --> 03:29:21.749
CORRIDORS, AND IN CONGESTED

03:29:21.815 --> 03:29:23.751
URBAN CENTERS WHERE CLEANER

03:29:23.817 --> 03:29:24.585
FUELS ARE PROVIDING IMMEDIATE

03:29:24.652 --> 03:29:26.787
AIR QUALITY BENEFITS, AND IN

03:29:26.854 --> 03:29:28.055
THE CASE OF BATTERY ELECTRIC

03:29:28.122 --> 03:29:29.690
VEHICLES AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

03:29:29.757 --> 03:29:31.158
VEHICLES, ZERO TAILPIPE

03:29:31.225 --> 03:29:33.060
EMISSIONS. NO GREENHOUSE GASES,

03:29:33.127 --> 03:29:35.296
NO CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. NO AIR

03:29:35.362 --> 03:29:38.465
TOXICS. THE LCFS IS ALSO

03:29:38.532 --> 03:29:39.533
HELPING SUPPORT THE

03:29:39.600 --> 03:29:41.802
DECARBONIZATION OF HYDROGEN

03:29:41.869 --> 03:29:43.771
WHEN THE PROGRAM IS HEALTHIER.

03:29:43.837 --> 03:29:45.773
PRIOR TO MARKET DISRUPTIONS OF

03:29:45.839 --> 03:29:47.875
THE FOUR YEARS OF DELIBERATION,

03:29:47.942 --> 03:29:50.010
AS WELL AS THE PANDEMIC, WE'RE

03:29:50.077 --> 03:29:51.445
SEEING UPWARDS OF 90% RENEWABLE

03:29:51.512 --> 03:29:52.646
HYDROGEN COME TO MARKET, DRIVEN

03:29:52.713 --> 03:29:55.582
EXCLUSIVELY BY THE LCFS. TODAY,

03:29:55.649 --> 03:29:57.718
WE'RE STILL AT 55% WITH A

03:29:57.785 --> 03:30:00.321
CARBON INTENSITY OF ZERO. IT'S

03:30:00.387 --> 03:30:02.222
DUE TO THE MECHANISM OF THE

03:30:02.289 --> 03:30:03.991
LCFS THAT'S CRITICALLY

03:30:04.058 --> 03:30:04.825
SUPPORTING THESE INVESTMENTS,

03:30:04.892 --> 03:30:06.593
AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CAPITAL,

03:30:06.660 --> 03:30:07.795
HEAVY INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE

03:30:07.861 --> 03:30:09.463
BEEN COMMITTED TO CALIFORNIA

03:30:09.530 --> 03:30:10.698
THROUGH ITS HYDROGEN HUB. IT IS

03:30:10.764 --> 03:30:12.800
LCFS THAT IS SUPPORTING THAT

03:30:12.866 --> 03:30:13.634
DRIVE AND THAT INVESTABLE

03:30:13.701 --> 03:30:15.669
SIGNAL TO THE STATE. SO, IN

03:30:15.736 --> 03:30:17.771
SHORT, THE LCFS HAS BEEN A

03:30:17.838 --> 03:30:19.239
CATALYST, SUPPORTS ZERO

03:30:19.306 --> 03:30:19.840
EMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE

03:30:19.907 --> 03:30:21.709
NONE EXISTED. IT ENABLES THE

03:30:21.775 --> 03:30:22.710
TRANSITION TO RENEWABLE FUELS

03:30:22.776 --> 03:30:24.745
WHERE PREVIOUSLY DIDN'T EXIST,

03:30:24.812 --> 03:30:26.480
AND DELIVERS REAL LOCAL PUBLIC

03:30:26.547 --> 03:30:27.648
HEALTH BENEFITS. AND FOR THESE

03:30:27.715 --> 03:30:30.184
REASONS, PRESERVING AND

03:30:30.250 --> 03:30:30.918
STRENGTHENING THE PROGRAM IS

03:30:30.985 --> 03:30:35.422
CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA. GOOD

03:30:35.489 --> 03:30:37.558
AFTERNOON, CO-CHAIRS AND

03:30:37.624 --> 03:30:38.692
MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING

03:30:38.759 --> 03:30:39.893
ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS

03:30:39.960 --> 03:30:41.428
TIFFANY ROBERTS AND I REPRESENT

03:30:41.495 --> 03:30:44.031
PHILLIPS 66. OUR COMPANY

03:30:44.098 --> 03:30:46.133
TRANSITIONED OUR TRADITIONAL

03:30:46.200 --> 03:30:49.303
REFINERY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:30:49.370 --> 03:30:51.071
TO PRODUCE RENEWABLE FUELS,

03:30:51.138 --> 03:30:52.606
NAMELY RENEWABLE DIESEL AND

03:30:52.673 --> 03:30:54.541
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL. WE

03:30:54.608 --> 03:30:56.610
WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY SHUTTERED

03:30:56.677 --> 03:30:59.079
THAT FACILITY HAD IT NOT BEEN

03:30:59.146 --> 03:31:00.714
FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THE LOW

03:31:00.781 --> 03:31:02.716
CARBON FUEL STANDARD. THE

03:31:02.783 --> 03:31:04.952
APPROACH AND VIEW OF OUR

03:31:05.019 --> 03:31:08.822
COMPANY IS THAT IF THE STATE OF

03:31:08.889 --> 03:31:09.356
CALIFORNIA WANTS RENEWABLE

03:31:09.423 --> 03:31:10.824
FUELS, WE WILL MEET CALIFORNIA

03:31:10.891 --> 03:31:13.460
IN THAT MOMENT AND WE WILL HELP

03:31:13.527 --> 03:31:15.095
YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS. THE

03:31:15.162 --> 03:31:17.164
FACILITY HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR

03:31:17.231 --> 03:31:20.300
129 YEARS, AND WE'VE GONE

03:31:20.367 --> 03:31:22.236
THROUGH A FEW TRANSITIONS FROM

03:31:22.302 --> 03:31:23.971
KEROSENE PRODUCTION TO

03:31:24.038 --> 03:31:25.472
TRADITIONAL FUELS TO NOW

03:31:25.539 --> 03:31:26.907
RENEWABLE DIESEL AND

03:31:26.974 --> 03:31:28.642
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL. I

03:31:28.709 --> 03:31:29.543
WANT TO PROVIDE A FEW STATS

03:31:29.610 --> 03:31:31.478
BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE

03:31:31.545 --> 03:31:32.713
IMPORTANT. AS WE THINK ABOUT

03:31:32.780 --> 03:31:33.814
WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE OF THE

03:31:33.881 --> 03:31:35.582
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. FIRST

03:31:35.649 --> 03:31:37.184
AND FOREMOST, OUR FACILITY

03:31:37.251 --> 03:31:41.922
EMPLOYS 385 EMPLOYEES AND 225

03:31:41.989 --> 03:31:45.059
CONTRACTORS. MOST OF THESE ARE

03:31:45.125 --> 03:31:47.461
UNITED STEELWORKERS LABORERS

03:31:47.528 --> 03:31:49.496
BUILDING TRADES. AND I THINK

03:31:49.563 --> 03:31:51.598
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT.

03:31:51.665 --> 03:31:53.700
AT FULL PRODUCTION, WE CAN

03:31:53.767 --> 03:31:56.737
PRODUCE 800 MILLION GALLONS OF

03:31:56.804 --> 03:31:58.906
FUEL. THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. IT

03:31:58.972 --> 03:32:01.742
ACTUALLY PUTS US IN POLE

03:32:01.809 --> 03:32:03.544
POSITION AS THE LARGEST

03:32:03.610 --> 03:32:05.712
RENEWABLE FUEL FACILITY IN THE

03:32:05.779 --> 03:32:07.548
WORLD. AND THAT IS BEHIND,

03:32:07.614 --> 03:32:09.183
CLOSELY BEHIND, BUT NONETHELESS

03:32:09.249 --> 03:32:11.952
BEHIND NESTY AND SINGAPORE. SO

03:32:12.019 --> 03:32:12.786
ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT. YOU

03:32:12.853 --> 03:32:15.989
HAVE THAT HERE IN YOUR BACKYARD.

03:32:16.056 --> 03:32:16.490
YOU'VE GOT THAT HERE IN

03:32:16.557 --> 03:32:18.459
CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT WE DO, WE

03:32:18.525 --> 03:32:20.027
TAKE USED MATERIAL THAT WOULD

03:32:20.094 --> 03:32:21.762
HAVE GONE INTO A LANDFILL AND

03:32:21.829 --> 03:32:23.897
WE MAKE IT INTO SOMETHING

03:32:23.964 --> 03:32:25.632
USEFUL. I REALLY APPRECIATED

03:32:25.699 --> 03:32:27.101
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT CROP

03:32:27.167 --> 03:32:28.535
BASED FEEDSTOCKS AND PALM OIL,

03:32:28.602 --> 03:32:30.571
THINGS LIKE THAT. I DO WANT TO

03:32:30.637 --> 03:32:32.206
NOTE FOR YOU, REALLY IMPORTANT

03:32:32.272 --> 03:32:33.474
PALM OIL DOES NOT RECEIVE AN

03:32:33.540 --> 03:32:34.808
LCFS CREDIT. IT'S BASICALLY

03:32:34.875 --> 03:32:36.844
TREATED AS FOSSIL DIESEL UNDER

03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:38.679
THE STATE'S LOW CARBON FUEL

03:32:38.745 --> 03:32:42.149
STANDARD. OUR FACILITY, WE HAVE

03:32:42.216 --> 03:32:46.120
VERY UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY THAT

03:32:46.186 --> 03:32:48.822
ALLOWS US TO TAKE SOME OF THIS

03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:51.492
VERY ROUGH STUFF AND CONVERT IT

03:32:51.558 --> 03:32:55.362
INTO VERY LOW CARBON INTENSIVE

03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:58.899
FUELS. SO RATHER THAN USING

03:32:58.966 --> 03:32:59.733
CROP BASED FEEDSTOCKS, WE

03:32:59.800 --> 03:33:01.602
ACTUALLY HAVE A COMPETITIVE

03:33:01.668 --> 03:33:04.872
ADVANTAGE FOR USING WASTE BASED

03:33:04.938 --> 03:33:06.673
FEEDSTOCKS. AGAIN, REALLY

03:33:06.740 --> 03:33:07.774
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF

03:33:07.841 --> 03:33:09.510
CALIFORNIA. A COUPLE OF OTHER

03:33:09.576 --> 03:33:12.079
THINGS TO FLAG AS YOU'RE

03:33:12.146 --> 03:33:12.579
THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE

03:33:12.646 --> 03:33:14.548
BENEFITS OF THE LOW CARBON FUEL

03:33:14.615 --> 03:33:17.317
STANDARD ARE, OUR FACILITY, WE

03:33:17.384 --> 03:33:19.153
WERE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR SOCKS

03:33:19.219 --> 03:33:26.093
BY 80%, PM10 BY 20%, NOX BY 33%.

03:33:26.160 --> 03:33:28.762
THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT LOCAL AIR

03:33:28.829 --> 03:33:30.397
EMISSION REDUCTIONS. THOSE ARE

03:33:30.464 --> 03:33:31.765
REALLY IMPORTANT. THE

03:33:31.832 --> 03:33:33.534
CONVERSION ALSO ALLOWS US TO

03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:35.869
REDUCE OUR WATER USAGE BY 160

03:33:35.936 --> 03:33:40.307
MILLION GALLONS PER YEAR. IN

03:33:40.374 --> 03:33:41.475
TERMS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF

03:33:41.542 --> 03:33:44.111
THE FACILITY, I DO WANT TO FLAG

03:33:44.178 --> 03:33:46.180
A COUPLE OF THINGS. DURING THE

03:33:46.246 --> 03:33:47.881
CONSTRUCTION PROCESS, WE

03:33:47.948 --> 03:33:50.117
EMPLOYED 2400 PEOPLE AT THAT

03:33:50.184 --> 03:33:53.754
SITE, 6 MILLION TOTAL HOURS, 6

03:33:53.820 --> 03:33:56.590
MILLION MAN HOURS OF

03:33:56.657 --> 03:33:58.158
CONSTRUCTION. THESE ARE HIGH

03:33:58.225 --> 03:34:02.029
PAYING FAMILY WAGE JOBS, VERY

03:34:02.095 --> 03:34:03.797
IMPORTANT. FOR EVERY ONE OF

03:34:03.864 --> 03:34:05.632
THOSE JOBS, THERE IS A

03:34:05.699 --> 03:34:07.868
MULTIPLIER EFFECT OF 12. SO

03:34:07.935 --> 03:34:09.803
THAT MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOT

03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:11.438
PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED THERE,

03:34:11.505 --> 03:34:12.639
BUT THEY'RE GOING OUT INTO THE

03:34:12.706 --> 03:34:14.341
COMMUNITY. THEY'RE USING THEIR

03:34:14.408 --> 03:34:15.842
WAGES. THAT IS HAVING AN

03:34:15.909 --> 03:34:18.645
INDUCED EFFECT TO IMPACT OTHER

03:34:18.712 --> 03:34:20.781
JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY.

03:34:20.847 --> 03:34:22.482
ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE OF OUR

03:34:22.549 --> 03:34:24.651
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

03:34:24.718 --> 03:34:25.519
ADVANTAGE, WE ARE ABLE TO

03:34:25.586 --> 03:34:26.720
PROVIDE NOT ONLY SUSTAINABLE

03:34:26.787 --> 03:34:29.389
AVIATION FUEL FOR SFO, WE'RE

03:34:29.456 --> 03:34:31.892
ALSO ABLE TO PROVIDE IT FOR LAX

03:34:31.959 --> 03:34:33.727
FOR SAN DIEGO. SO IT HAS AN

03:34:33.794 --> 03:34:36.597
IMPACT UP AND DOWN THE STATE. I

03:34:36.663 --> 03:34:38.665
DO WANT TO FLAG, THOUGH, THAT

03:34:38.732 --> 03:34:39.666
WE ARE FACING ECONOMIC

03:34:39.733 --> 03:34:42.069
HEADWINDS, AND IT'S BECAUSE

03:34:42.135 --> 03:34:44.504
PROGRAMS LIKE THE LCFS ARE

03:34:44.571 --> 03:34:46.773
UNDER ATTACK. AND SO WE WOULD

03:34:46.840 --> 03:34:48.875
ASK, AS YOU ARE DELIBERATING ON

03:34:48.942 --> 03:34:51.678
THE LCFS, TO RECOGNIZE THAT

03:34:51.745 --> 03:34:53.480
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BENEFITS

03:34:53.547 --> 03:34:55.616
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM.

03:34:55.682 --> 03:34:58.685
AND ALSO, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

03:34:58.752 --> 03:35:01.388
TO NOTE THAT MARKET CERTAINTY

03:35:01.455 --> 03:35:05.359
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. WE HAVE

03:35:05.425 --> 03:35:06.460
MADE BIG INVESTMENTS IN THIS

03:35:06.526 --> 03:35:09.196
STATE, AND IF FACILITIES LIKE

03:35:09.263 --> 03:35:11.965
OURS AREN'T ABLE TO SUSTAIN

03:35:12.032 --> 03:35:13.166
THAT INVESTMENT, THAT SIGNALS

03:35:13.233 --> 03:35:15.502
TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, IT

03:35:15.569 --> 03:35:17.037
SIGNALS TO THE REST OF THE

03:35:17.104 --> 03:35:18.672
WORLD. THE CALIFORNIA IS NOT

03:35:18.739 --> 03:35:19.940
OPEN FOR BUSINESS. AND I KNOW

03:35:20.007 --> 03:35:21.708
THAT NONE OF YOU WANT TO SIGNAL

03:35:21.775 --> 03:35:24.011
THAT. SO WITH THAT, I WILL

03:35:24.077 --> 03:35:24.978
CLOSE MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO

03:35:25.045 --> 03:35:32.419
TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO

03:35:32.486 --> 03:35:33.420
MUCH. LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR

03:35:33.487 --> 03:35:34.821
JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:35:34.888 --> 03:35:35.889
WE'RE A COMMUNITY BASED

03:35:35.956 --> 03:35:37.424
ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION BASED IN

03:35:37.491 --> 03:35:39.159
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND

03:35:39.226 --> 03:35:40.761
COACHELLA VALLEY. TO ANSWER

03:35:40.827 --> 03:35:42.562
CHAIR WILSON'S QUESTION THAT

03:35:42.629 --> 03:35:45.732
OPENED THIS HEARING. NO, THE

03:35:45.799 --> 03:35:47.567
BENEFIT OF THE LCFS AS THE

03:35:47.634 --> 03:35:49.603
PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY DESIGNED,

03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:51.905
DO NOT JUSTIFY ITS COSTS. COSTS

03:35:51.972 --> 03:35:54.241
THAT ARE REGRESSIVE AND WILL

03:35:54.308 --> 03:35:55.542
INCREASE OVER TIME. I WILL

03:35:55.609 --> 03:35:57.644
FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON LIVESTOCK,

03:35:57.711 --> 03:35:58.812
BIOGAS, AND THERE ARE SIMILAR

03:35:58.879 --> 03:36:00.547
CONCERNS THAT HOPEFULLY OTHERS

03:36:00.614 --> 03:36:02.683
WILL BRING UP LATER TODAY ABOUT

03:36:02.749 --> 03:36:06.119
CROP BASED FUELS, ESPECIALLY

03:36:06.186 --> 03:36:07.554
WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL

03:36:07.621 --> 03:36:08.155
JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AND LOWER

03:36:08.221 --> 03:36:10.657
INCOME COMMUNITIES. AS YOU'VE

03:36:10.724 --> 03:36:12.926
HEARD TODAY ALREADY, LIVESTOCK

03:36:12.993 --> 03:36:14.928
BIOGAS RECEIVES WILDLY, I WOULD

03:36:14.995 --> 03:36:16.697
SAY, ABSURDLY NEGATIVE CARBON

03:36:16.763 --> 03:36:18.498
INTENSITY SCORES, WHICH IN TURN

03:36:18.565 --> 03:36:20.767
DRIVES CREDIT GENERATION AND

03:36:20.834 --> 03:36:22.502
CREDIT SALES TO OIL AND GAS

03:36:22.569 --> 03:36:24.805
PRODUCERS WHO IN TURN PASS SOME

03:36:24.871 --> 03:36:26.740
OR ALL OF THOSE COSTS TO

03:36:26.807 --> 03:36:28.875
DRIVERS. THIS NEGATIVE CARBON

03:36:28.942 --> 03:36:29.810
INTENSITY IS DUE ENTIRELY TO

03:36:29.876 --> 03:36:31.278
ALLEGED METHANE EMISSIONS

03:36:31.345 --> 03:36:32.779
REDUCTIONS AT LIVESTOCK

03:36:32.846 --> 03:36:35.482
OPERATIONS. LIVESTOCK BIOGAS IS

03:36:35.549 --> 03:36:37.651
NOT A CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUEL.

03:36:37.718 --> 03:36:39.586
IT EMITS CLIMATE AND AIR

03:36:39.653 --> 03:36:41.555
POLLUTION WHEN COMBUSTED, JUST

03:36:41.621 --> 03:36:43.790
LIKE ANY OTHER FUEL. BIOGAS

03:36:43.857 --> 03:36:45.792
PRODUCTION REQUIRES.

03:36:45.859 --> 03:36:47.861
ADDITIONALLY, THE ACCUMULATION

03:36:47.928 --> 03:36:51.998
OF VAST AMOUNTS OF LIQUEFIED

03:36:52.065 --> 03:36:53.266
WET MANURE. AS MR. BOCCADORO

03:36:53.333 --> 03:36:55.502
SAID, YES, MANURE HAPPENS. IT

03:36:55.569 --> 03:36:56.770
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIQUEFIED

03:36:56.837 --> 03:36:59.840
AND STORED IN VAST, VAST VATS,

03:36:59.906 --> 03:37:04.978
MANURE POOLS. THE. THIS

03:37:05.045 --> 03:37:06.680
ACCUMULATION OF WET MANURE

03:37:06.747 --> 03:37:07.948
RESULTS IN AIR AND WATER

03:37:08.014 --> 03:37:09.549
POLLUTION IN LOWER INCOME

03:37:09.616 --> 03:37:11.718
COMMUNITIES NEAR LOWER INCOME

03:37:11.785 --> 03:37:13.120
COMMUNITIES, ALMOST ENTIRELY IN

03:37:13.186 --> 03:37:14.721
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND IN

03:37:14.788 --> 03:37:17.824
CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY,

03:37:17.891 --> 03:37:19.659
BIOGAS REPRESENTS, BECAUSE OF

03:37:19.726 --> 03:37:21.461
THE THE LOW CARBON INTENSITY

03:37:21.528 --> 03:37:23.163
SCORES, A VERY HIGH PORTION OF

CREDITS IN THE PROGRAM, ABOUT

03:37:25.532 --> 03:37:28.268
CLOSE TO 20% IN A MINUSCULE

03:37:28.335 --> 03:37:29.703
AMOUNT OF THE ACTUAL FUEL IN

03:37:29.770 --> 03:37:33.907
THE PROGRAM. LCFS COSTS BORNE

03:37:33.974 --> 03:37:35.876
BY CALIFORNIANS AND

03:37:35.942 --> 03:37:37.377
DISPROPORTIONATELY BY LOWER

03:37:37.444 --> 03:37:39.579
INCOME CALIFORNIANS AS A RESULT

03:37:39.646 --> 03:37:42.015
OF THE PURCHASE OF LIVESTOCK.

03:37:42.082 --> 03:37:43.350
BIOGAS CREDITS DO NOT

03:37:43.417 --> 03:37:45.685
CONTRIBUTE TO A LOWER TO A

03:37:45.752 --> 03:37:49.089
CLEANER FUEL MIX IN CALIFORNIA.

03:37:49.156 --> 03:37:51.425
RATHER, AT BEST, CALIFORNIA

03:37:51.491 --> 03:37:54.060
DRIVERS ARE PAYING AND WILL PAY

03:37:54.127 --> 03:37:55.829
INCREASINGLY MORE TO PARTIALLY

03:37:55.896 --> 03:37:58.198
ABATE METHANE POLLUTION AT

03:37:58.265 --> 03:37:59.933
LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS, EVEN AS

03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:00.634
THOSE LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS

03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:02.769
CONTINUE TO POLLUTE NEARBY

03:38:02.836 --> 03:38:05.372
COMMUNITIES. IF CARB AND THE

03:38:05.439 --> 03:38:07.541
LEGISLATURE WANT THE LCFS TO

03:38:07.607 --> 03:38:09.743
TRULY BE A CLEAN FUEL AND

03:38:09.810 --> 03:38:10.844
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM, THE

03:38:10.911 --> 03:38:13.713
LCFS MUST BE MODIFIED TO STOP

03:38:13.780 --> 03:38:15.549
FORCING CALIFORNIA DRIVERS TO

03:38:15.615 --> 03:38:18.084
SUBSIDIZE POLLUTING BIOGAS

03:38:18.151 --> 03:38:19.419
PRODUCTION AND INSTEAD INVEST

03:38:19.486 --> 03:38:21.721
LWCF DOLLARS IN ZERO EMISSION

03:38:21.788 --> 03:38:24.491
SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH

03:38:24.558 --> 03:38:27.828
FOR YOUR TIME. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE

03:38:27.894 --> 03:38:30.564
GOING TO SWITCH OUT. AND AS WE

03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:31.731
NAVIGATE I KNOW THAT THE

03:38:31.798 --> 03:38:32.966
PANELISTS ARE STAYING AROUND.

03:38:33.033 --> 03:38:34.968
SO WE'LL FIGURE OUT CHAIR

03:38:35.035 --> 03:38:36.970
BETWEEN THE CHAIRS AND THE

03:38:37.037 --> 03:38:37.737
PUBLIC COMMENT MICROPHONE IN

03:38:37.804 --> 03:38:40.207
TERMS OF ASKING QUESTIONS AS

03:38:40.273 --> 03:38:48.482
MEMBERS MAY CALL ON FOLKS. ALL

03:38:48.548 --> 03:38:50.750
RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:38:50.817 --> 03:38:51.618
GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M CAITLIN

03:38:51.685 --> 03:38:53.587
SUTTER, I'M CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR

03:38:53.653 --> 03:38:56.089
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND.

03:38:56.156 --> 03:38:57.624
APPRECIATE YOU HAVING THIS

03:38:57.691 --> 03:38:58.892
HEARING AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

03:38:58.959 --> 03:39:00.427
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

03:39:00.494 --> 03:39:02.562
TRANSPORTATION PRODUCES NEARLY

03:39:02.629 --> 03:39:04.197
40% OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE

03:39:04.264 --> 03:39:06.466
GAS EMISSIONS. AND THE LCFS

03:39:06.533 --> 03:39:09.102
DIRECTLY TACKLES THIS BY

03:39:09.169 --> 03:39:09.870
REQUIRING CLEANER FUELS THAT

03:39:09.936 --> 03:39:12.072
MEET OR EXCEED THE CARBON

03:39:12.138 --> 03:39:13.507
INTENSITY STANDARDS SET BY THE

03:39:13.573 --> 03:39:14.808
PROGRAM. I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD

03:39:14.875 --> 03:39:17.744
ALL THESE DETAILS TODAY, BUT

03:39:17.811 --> 03:39:18.879
IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL AS

03:39:18.945 --> 03:39:20.580
CALIFORNIA SEEKS TO DECARBONIZE

03:39:20.647 --> 03:39:22.215
OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FOR

03:39:22.282 --> 03:39:23.984
ALL OF THE HEALTH AND CLIMATE

03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:25.619
BENEFITS THAT WOULD COME ALONG

03:39:25.685 --> 03:39:27.721
WITH THAT, WE REALLY HAVE TO BE

03:39:27.787 --> 03:39:29.689
ACCELERATING THE TRANSFER, THE

03:39:29.756 --> 03:39:31.324
TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL

03:39:31.391 --> 03:39:34.661
FUELS. UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THE

03:39:34.728 --> 03:39:36.596
RECENT, I WOULD SAY, ILLEGAL

03:39:36.663 --> 03:39:38.665
ACTIONS BY CONGRESS, THE STATE

03:39:38.732 --> 03:39:41.134
HAS EVEN FEWER TOOLS AVAILABLE

03:39:41.201 --> 03:39:42.869
TO US TO ADDRESS TRANSPORTATION

03:39:42.936 --> 03:39:45.105
EMISSIONS SPECIFICALLY. AND

03:39:45.171 --> 03:39:47.774
THAT MAKES THE LOW CARBON FUEL

03:39:47.841 --> 03:39:48.975
STANDARD EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL

03:39:49.042 --> 03:39:51.678
THAN EVER. A KEY TO THIS

03:39:51.745 --> 03:39:53.747
PROGRAM'S SUCCESS IS ITS

03:39:53.813 --> 03:39:55.849
FLEXIBLE, MARKET BASED DESIGN,

03:39:55.916 --> 03:39:56.816
WHICH LETS FUEL PROVIDERS FIND

03:39:56.883 --> 03:39:59.119
THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAY TO CUT

03:39:59.185 --> 03:40:00.387
FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS AND

03:40:00.453 --> 03:40:02.522
REDUCE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF

03:40:02.589 --> 03:40:04.424
THE FUELS THAT THEY PRODUCE. A

03:40:04.491 --> 03:40:06.693
MORE AMBITIOUS CARBON INTENSITY

03:40:06.760 --> 03:40:08.929
STANDARD LIKE NO CARB PASSED

03:40:08.995 --> 03:40:10.564
THAT YOU HEARD ALL ABOUT

03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:12.132
EARLIER ENSURES THAT EVEN

03:40:12.198 --> 03:40:14.801
CURRENT ALTERNATIVE FUELS LIKE

03:40:14.868 --> 03:40:16.069
RENEWABLE DIESEL MUST

03:40:16.136 --> 03:40:17.404
CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THEIR

03:40:17.470 --> 03:40:19.039
PERFORMANCE AND CONTINUOUSLY

03:40:19.105 --> 03:40:20.907
REDUCE THEIR CARBON INTENSITY.

03:40:20.974 --> 03:40:23.510
WHILE MANY TRANSPORTATION NEEDS

03:40:23.577 --> 03:40:25.645
CAN AND SHOULD BE FULLY

03:40:25.712 --> 03:40:27.414
ELECTRIFIED, WHERE WE CONTINUE

03:40:27.480 --> 03:40:29.015
TO NEED LIQUID FUELS, THEY

03:40:29.082 --> 03:40:30.650
SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY IMPROVING

03:40:30.717 --> 03:40:31.885
THEIR PERFORMANCE. AND THIS IS

03:40:31.952 --> 03:40:34.120
WHAT IS SUPPORTED BY THE LOW

03:40:34.187 --> 03:40:34.921
CARBON FUEL STANDARD.

03:40:34.988 --> 03:40:36.456
CALIFORNIA HAS SET THE

03:40:36.523 --> 03:40:37.857
PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR

03:40:37.924 --> 03:40:38.725
TRANSPORTATION FUELS AND LETS

03:40:38.792 --> 03:40:40.927
THE MARKET INNOVATE SOLUTIONS,

03:40:40.994 --> 03:40:43.096
WHICH THEREFORE MINIMIZES THE

03:40:43.163 --> 03:40:45.165
COST OF ACHIEVING THESE

03:40:45.231 --> 03:40:46.666
EMISSION REDUCTIONS. CALIFORNIA

03:40:46.733 --> 03:40:49.769
HAS PROVEN THAT WE CAN BOTH CUT

03:40:49.836 --> 03:40:50.604
EMISSIONS AND SUPPORT ECONOMIC

03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:53.573
GROWTH AT THE SAME TIME, AND

03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:55.075
FLEXIBLE, AMBITIOUS MARKET

03:40:55.141 --> 03:40:58.044
BASED POLICIES LIKE THE LCFS IS

03:40:58.111 --> 03:40:58.645
ESSENTIAL TO CONTINUING BOTH

03:40:58.712 --> 03:41:00.747
THIS EMISSION AND ECONOMIC

03:41:00.814 --> 03:41:03.650
PROGRESS FOR THE LCFS IS NOT

03:41:03.717 --> 03:41:05.852
JUST ABOUT REDUCING THE CARBON

03:41:05.919 --> 03:41:07.554
INTENSITY OF FUELS, IT'S ALSO

03:41:07.621 --> 03:41:08.655
HELPING TO MAKE ZERO EMISSION

03:41:08.722 --> 03:41:10.857
VEHICLES MORE AFFORDABLE.

03:41:10.924 --> 03:41:12.859
REVENUE FROM LCFS LCFS CREDITS

03:41:12.926 --> 03:41:15.695
HAS FUNDED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

03:41:15.762 --> 03:41:16.630
OF DOLLARS IN REBATES FOR

03:41:16.696 --> 03:41:18.431
ELECTRIC CARS AND CHARGING

03:41:18.498 --> 03:41:19.833
STATIONS, INCLUDING PROGRAMS

03:41:19.899 --> 03:41:21.735
THAT ASSIST LOW AND MIDDLE

03:41:21.801 --> 03:41:23.637
INCOME DRIVERS. I KNOW LARA IS

03:41:23.703 --> 03:41:25.305
GOING TO TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT

03:41:25.372 --> 03:41:27.273
THAT, BUT BUT THE UPSHOT IS

03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:28.675
THIS IS REALLY A KEY DRIVER OF

03:41:28.742 --> 03:41:30.477
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION.

03:41:30.543 --> 03:41:32.812
SO THIS PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL.

03:41:32.879 --> 03:41:35.148
IT IS COST EFFECTIVE TO REDUCE

03:41:35.215 --> 03:41:35.749
OUR TRANSPORTATION POLLUTION.

03:41:35.815 --> 03:41:38.418
BUT IT IS NOT PERFECT. MORE CAN

03:41:38.485 --> 03:41:40.453
BE DONE TO ADDRESS LOCAL

03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:41.888
POLLUTION AROUND DAIRIES,

03:41:41.955 --> 03:41:44.424
AROUND PORTS, AROUND AIRPORTS.

03:41:44.491 --> 03:41:46.660
WE NEED CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

03:41:46.726 --> 03:41:48.528
IN MEASURING AND ADDRESSING

03:41:48.595 --> 03:41:49.729
INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGE AND

03:41:49.796 --> 03:41:51.965
AVOIDING PURPOSE GROWN FUEL

03:41:52.032 --> 03:41:53.600
CROPS. WE ALSO NEED TO BE

03:41:53.667 --> 03:41:55.568
MAXIMIZING OPPORTUNITIES TO

03:41:55.635 --> 03:41:57.737
SUPPORT FULLY ZERO EMISSION

03:41:57.804 --> 03:41:59.539
TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING

03:41:59.606 --> 03:42:02.442
ELECTRIFICATION, AND WE NEED TO

03:42:02.509 --> 03:42:03.643
ADDRESS EMISSIONS FROM GROWING

03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:06.413
AND HARD TO ABATE SECTORS LIKE

03:42:06.479 --> 03:42:08.048
AVIATION. SO MAKE NO MISTAKE

03:42:08.114 --> 03:42:09.649
CALIFORNIA MUST CONTINUE TO

03:42:09.716 --> 03:42:10.984
REDUCE CLIMATE, POLLUTION AND

03:42:11.051 --> 03:42:12.952
LOCAL AIR POLLUTION, AND

03:42:13.019 --> 03:42:14.421
TRANSPORTATION IS THE LARGEST

03:42:14.487 --> 03:42:16.489
CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT POLLUTION,

03:42:16.556 --> 03:42:19.392
AND THE LCFS IS ONE OF THE FEW

03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:21.594
TOOLS WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

03:42:21.661 --> 03:42:22.662
TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS THAT

03:42:22.729 --> 03:42:24.464
WE HAVE NOT LOST UNDER THE

03:42:24.531 --> 03:42:25.532
CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION.

03:42:25.598 --> 03:42:27.801
IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST COST

03:42:27.867 --> 03:42:30.170
EFFECTIVE CLIMATE POLICIES IN

03:42:30.236 --> 03:42:32.172
OUR PORTFOLIO. SO I REALLY

03:42:32.238 --> 03:42:33.506
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR

03:42:33.573 --> 03:42:36.042

03:42:48.188 --> 03:42:50.690
COALITION, OR MTC, AND WE ARE

03:42:50.757 --> 03:42:51.391
AN INDUSTRY COALITION

03:42:51.458 --> 03:42:53.893
REPRESENTING THE ELECTRIC

03:42:53.960 --> 03:42:55.261
UTILITIES, AUTOMAKERS AND

03:42:55.328 --> 03:42:56.529
CHARGING STATION PROVIDERS THAT

03:42:56.596 --> 03:42:58.598
ARE COMMITTED TO THE ZERO

03:42:58.665 --> 03:43:00.467
EMISSION TRANSPORTATION FUTURE.

03:43:00.533 --> 03:43:03.069
CÁC MEMBERS STRONGLY SUPPORT

03:43:03.136 --> 03:43:04.938
THE LCFS AS THE ELECTRIC

03:43:05.004 --> 03:43:06.606
UTILITIES AND THE FUELING

03:43:06.673 --> 03:43:08.708
SUPPLY EQUIPMENT OWNERS EARN

03:43:08.775 --> 03:43:10.543
CREDITS, MONETIZE THOSE CREDITS,

03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:11.644
AND FUND PROGRAMS AND

INVESTMENTS IN ELECTRIC

03:43:12.979 --> 03:43:14.714
VEHICLES. I WANT TO FIRST START

03:43:14.781 --> 03:43:16.716
WITH THE UTILITIES FOR THE

03:43:16.783 --> 03:43:18.852
UTILITIES, A PORTION OF THE

03:43:18.918 --> 03:43:20.019
CREDITS THAT THEY EARN ARE

03:43:20.086 --> 03:43:21.721
DEPOSITED INTO A STATEWIDE

03:43:21.788 --> 03:43:23.790
PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA

03:43:23.857 --> 03:43:25.892

03:43:25.959 --> 03:43:26.793
PORTION OF THE CREDITS, OR

03:43:26.860 --> 03:43:28.661
HOLDBACK FUNDS, ARE USED FOR

03:43:28.728 --> 03:43:30.697
EACH BY EACH UTILITY FOR

03:43:30.764 --> 03:43:32.432
PROGRAMS WITHIN THEIR

UTILITIES EARN FROM THE LCFS GO

03:43:39.005 --> 03:43:41.040
BACK TO CUSTOMER PROGRAMS. ZERO

03:43:41.107 --> 03:43:42.876
CREDITS GO TO UTILITIES, BOTTOM

LCFS, THE UTILITIES, BOTH THE

03:43:46.613 --> 03:43:47.847
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND

03:43:47.914 --> 03:43:49.916
THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES

03:43:49.983 --> 03:43:52.719
HAVE SPENT OVER $840 MILLION IN

03:43:52.786 --> 03:43:54.420
PROGRAMS INCENTIVIZING ZERO

03:43:54.487 --> 03:43:56.589
EMISSION VEHICLE ADOPTION.

03:43:56.656 --> 03:43:58.925
THEY'VE PROVIDED OVER 700,000

03:43:58.992 --> 03:44:01.728
REBATES TO EV BUYERS, PRE OWNED

03:44:01.795 --> 03:44:04.130
OR USED EV REBATE PROGRAMS,

03:44:04.197 --> 03:44:04.731
WITH INCREASED INCENTIVES FOR

THE FUTURE, THE UTILITIES WILL

03:44:21.447 --> 03:44:23.516
USE THE HOLDBACK PROGRAMS FOR

03:44:23.583 --> 03:44:26.553
SIMILAR, SIMILAR TYPE PROGRAMS.

03:44:26.619 --> 03:44:27.654
ADDITIONALLY, SOME WILL ALSO

03:44:27.720 --> 03:44:29.589
USE THE HOLDBACK FUNDS FOR

03:44:29.656 --> 03:44:30.657
NEEDED GRID INVESTMENTS TO

03:44:30.723 --> 03:44:33.226
SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION.

03:44:33.293 --> 03:44:34.327
PURSUANT TO THE 2024 AMENDMENTS,

03:44:34.394 --> 03:44:36.663
THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN FUEL

03:44:36.729 --> 03:44:38.998
REWARD PROGRAM, WHICH IS THE

03:44:39.065 --> 03:44:39.499
STATEWIDE UTILITY FUNDED

03:44:39.566 --> 03:44:41.067
PROGRAM, WILL SHIFT FROM A

03:44:41.134 --> 03:44:42.569
STATEWIDE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE

03:44:42.635 --> 03:44:44.637
REBATE TO A STATEWIDE MEDIUM

03:44:44.704 --> 03:44:47.540
AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE AND ZERO

03:44:47.607 --> 03:44:50.610
EMISSION MOTORCYCLE REBATE. THE

03:44:50.677 --> 03:44:51.811
FEELING NOW TURNING TO THE

03:44:51.878 --> 03:44:52.946
FUELING SUPPLY, EQUIPMENT

03:44:53.012 --> 03:44:54.547
OWNERS OR THE CHARGING STATION

03:44:54.614 --> 03:44:57.417
PROVIDERS. THEY ALSO EARN LCFS

03:44:57.483 --> 03:44:59.586
CREDITS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.

03:44:59.652 --> 03:45:01.821
THEY CAN EARN CREDITS BY

03:45:01.888 --> 03:45:03.523
NONRESIDENTIAL EV CHARGING, BY

03:45:03.590 --> 03:45:05.425
RESIDENTIAL METERED CHARGING.

03:45:05.491 --> 03:45:06.693
IF THE RESIDENTIAL CHARGING IS

03:45:06.759 --> 03:45:09.596
CLEANER THAN THE AVERAGE GRID

03:45:09.662 --> 03:45:11.531
ELECTRICITY, AND FROM CAPACITY

03:45:11.598 --> 03:45:14.033
CREDITING. SIMILAR TO WHAT MIKE

03:45:14.100 --> 03:45:14.901
TALKED ABOUT FROM THE HYDROGEN

03:45:14.968 --> 03:45:16.703
CONTEXT, CAPACITY CREDITING

03:45:16.769 --> 03:45:17.804
ALLOWS THE FUEL SUPPLY

03:45:17.871 --> 03:45:20.039
EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS TO EARN

03:45:20.106 --> 03:45:20.940
CREDITS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE

03:45:21.007 --> 03:45:23.142
STATIONS, EVEN IF THEY AREN'T

03:45:23.209 --> 03:45:24.477
FULLY UTILIZED. THIS IS

03:45:24.544 --> 03:45:27.313
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE BUILDOUT OF

03:45:27.380 --> 03:45:27.947
NEEDED CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

03:45:28.014 --> 03:45:29.916
THAT CONSUMERS NEED TO SEE IN

03:45:29.983 --> 03:45:31.718
ORDER TO FEEL CONFIDENT IN

03:45:31.784 --> 03:45:33.820
PURCHASING AN EV IN THE

03:45:33.887 --> 03:45:34.687
ELECTRIC VEHICLE SPACE. WE ALSO

03:45:34.754 --> 03:45:37.090
HAVE THE CHICKEN AND EGG

03:45:37.156 --> 03:45:38.458
PROBLEM. WITHOUT INFRASTRUCTURE,

03:45:38.524 --> 03:45:39.626
CUSTOMERS DON'T WANT TO

03:45:39.692 --> 03:45:41.895
PURCHASE AN EV, BUT WITHOUT EV

03:45:41.961 --> 03:45:43.062
PURCHASES, CHARGING PROVIDERS

03:45:43.129 --> 03:45:44.664
CAN'T GET THE CERTAINTY THEY

03:45:44.731 --> 03:45:46.366
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

03:45:46.432 --> 03:45:49.168
PROJECTS OR REACH PROFITABLE

03:45:49.235 --> 03:45:50.837
UTILIZATION OVER TIME. AS

03:45:50.904 --> 03:45:53.606
STATION UTILIZATION INCREASES,

03:45:53.673 --> 03:45:55.842
THE STATION GENERATES MORE LCFS

03:45:55.909 --> 03:45:57.543
CREDITS FOR DISPENSED FUEL AND

03:45:57.610 --> 03:45:59.245
FUEL, FEWER INFRASTRUCTURE

03:45:59.312 --> 03:46:02.115
CREDITS. WITH THE 2024

03:46:02.181 --> 03:46:03.683
AMENDMENTS TO THE LCFS FUELING

03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:04.517
SUPPLY, EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS CAN

03:46:04.584 --> 03:46:06.519
ALSO EARN CAPACITY CREDITS FOR

03:46:06.586 --> 03:46:08.655
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY CHARGING.

03:46:08.721 --> 03:46:09.522
THESE TWO PROGRAMS WILL

03:46:09.589 --> 03:46:12.625
DOVETAIL NICELY WITH THE

03:46:12.692 --> 03:46:13.793
STATEWIDE REBATE FOR MEDIUM AND

03:46:13.860 --> 03:46:15.561
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. THE

03:46:15.628 --> 03:46:16.696
CREDITS PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED

03:46:16.763 --> 03:46:18.431
UPFRONT FUNDS FOR INSTALLATION

03:46:18.498 --> 03:46:19.766
AND OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

03:46:19.832 --> 03:46:21.801
COSTS, SINCE THE CAPACITY

03:46:21.868 --> 03:46:23.436
CREDITING PROGRAM ORIGINALLY

03:46:23.503 --> 03:46:25.805
TOOK EFFECT IN 2019, CARB HAS

03:46:25.872 --> 03:46:28.474
ISSUED NEARLY 1 MILLION IN

03:46:28.541 --> 03:46:29.575
INFRASTRUCTURE CREDITS,

03:46:29.642 --> 03:46:31.177
TOTALING ALMOST. I'M SORRY

03:46:31.244 --> 03:46:32.378
ISSUED NEARLY 1 MILLION

03:46:32.445 --> 03:46:33.746
INFRASTRUCTURE CREDITS TOTALING

03:46:33.813 --> 03:46:35.815
ALMOST $100 MILLION IN VALUE.

03:46:35.882 --> 03:46:38.584
FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE,

03:46:38.651 --> 03:46:40.486
ITC STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE LCFS

03:46:40.553 --> 03:46:42.655
AND SIMILARLY ENCOURAGES NO

03:46:42.722 --> 03:46:44.691
CHANGES AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU

03:46:44.757 --> 03:46:46.092
FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND TIME

03:46:46.159 --> 03:46:49.729
TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO

03:46:49.796 --> 03:46:51.664
ALL OF OUR PANELISTS IN THIS

03:46:51.731 --> 03:46:52.966
THIRD PANEL FOR YOUR REMARKS.

03:46:53.032 --> 03:46:54.534
WE KNOW WE HAD TO HAVE YOU

03:46:54.600 --> 03:46:56.102
TRUNCATE THEM INTO A LITTLE

03:46:56.169 --> 03:46:58.271
SHORT SOUNDBITE. SO WE

03:46:58.338 --> 03:46:58.705
APPRECIATE YOU BEING

03:46:58.771 --> 03:47:00.540
INFORMATIVE WHILE STILL BEING

03:47:00.606 --> 03:47:01.874
CONCISE. I'M GOING TO BRING IT

03:47:01.941 --> 03:47:04.043
BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR

03:47:04.110 --> 03:47:06.012
QUESTIONS, STARTING WITH MY CO

03:47:06.079 --> 03:47:07.480
CHAIR FOR COMMENTS. THANK YOU.

03:47:07.547 --> 03:47:09.682
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

03:47:09.749 --> 03:47:12.085
TO ALL THE PANELISTS. CERTAINLY

03:47:12.151 --> 03:47:14.554
HERE AT THE END. BUT EVEN THE

03:47:14.620 --> 03:47:15.722
PRIOR PANELISTS, I KNOW I HAD

03:47:15.788 --> 03:47:17.490
QUESTIONS FOR THE OTHERS, AND I

03:47:17.557 --> 03:47:18.758
WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS

03:47:18.825 --> 03:47:21.394
HERE AT THE END WHO AT SOME

03:47:21.461 --> 03:47:23.596
POINT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS

03:47:23.663 --> 03:47:26.599
REACHED OUT AND PROVIDED SOME

03:47:26.666 --> 03:47:28.835
INPUT. IT'S REALLY BEEN HELPFUL

03:47:28.901 --> 03:47:30.703
TO ME. TODAY HAS BEEN REALLY

03:47:30.770 --> 03:47:33.239
HELPFUL JUST IN LEARNING MORE

03:47:33.306 --> 03:47:35.408
AND IDENTIFYING SORT OF FROM A

03:47:35.475 --> 03:47:37.577
POLICY PERSPECTIVE WHERE WE

03:47:37.643 --> 03:47:39.645
WANT TO GO. AND I THINK MY MY

03:47:39.712 --> 03:47:44.117
TAKEAWAYS ARE THAT LCFS HAS

03:47:44.183 --> 03:47:47.754
BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM

03:47:47.820 --> 03:47:50.590
AND IT'S DONE. SO IN A WAY,

03:47:50.656 --> 03:47:51.858
FROM THE DATA THAT'S BEEN

03:47:51.924 --> 03:47:54.027
PRESENTED AND THE INFORMATION

03:47:54.093 --> 03:47:56.696
AND AGAIN, THE RESEARCH THAT

03:47:56.763 --> 03:47:58.564
HAS BEEN PRESENTED DONE SO

03:47:58.631 --> 03:48:00.800
PRIMARILY IN AN EFFICIENT AND

03:48:00.867 --> 03:48:03.136
COST EFFECTIVE WAY. WE'VE HEARD

03:48:03.202 --> 03:48:03.803
IT FROM OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:06.539
AND WE'VE HEARD IT FROM THOSE

03:48:06.606 --> 03:48:07.940
WHO REPRESENT INDUSTRY AND

03:48:08.007 --> 03:48:10.410
ACADEMICS ALL AROUND. I THINK

03:48:10.476 --> 03:48:12.645
IT'S PRETTY, PRETTY CLEAR IT'S

03:48:12.712 --> 03:48:14.714
TODAY'S HEARING HAS REALLY

03:48:14.781 --> 03:48:16.582
CONFIRMED THAT FOR ME

03:48:16.649 --> 03:48:18.384
PERSONALLY, AND I WANTED TO

03:48:18.451 --> 03:48:20.286
MAKE SURE I SAID THAT AT THE

03:48:20.353 --> 03:48:22.688
ONSET, IT I THINK IT ALSO HAS

03:48:22.755 --> 03:48:24.323
DRIVEN SOMETHING WE DON'T MAYBE

03:48:24.390 --> 03:48:26.659
TALK ABOUT. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

03:48:26.726 --> 03:48:28.728
WE DON'T QUANTIFY VERY WELL IS

03:48:28.795 --> 03:48:30.696
THE INNOVATION THAT'S BEEN

03:48:30.763 --> 03:48:32.799
DRIVEN AS A RESULT OF THIS. AND

03:48:32.865 --> 03:48:34.934
IF NOTHING ELSE, IN CALIFORNIA,

03:48:35.001 --> 03:48:38.538
WE ARE REALLY WE HAVE BEEN

03:48:38.604 --> 03:48:42.041
SUCCESSFUL IN OUR ECONOMY AND

03:48:42.108 --> 03:48:43.576
IN JOB CREATION AND WHERE WE

03:48:43.643 --> 03:48:45.711
STAND AS A RESULT OF INNOVATION,

03:48:45.778 --> 03:48:47.647
IN THIS CASE, THE FORESIGHT OF

03:48:47.713 --> 03:48:49.882
THOSE WHO IMPLEMENTED THESE

03:48:49.949 --> 03:48:52.852
PROGRAMS TO BEGIN WITH. I KNOW

03:48:52.919 --> 03:48:54.954
OFTEN THE THE THE IDEA THAT

03:48:55.021 --> 03:48:56.589
INNOVATION WOULD OCCUR IN A NEW

03:48:56.656 --> 03:48:59.092
ECONOMY, A NEW SECTOR, IF YOU

03:48:59.158 --> 03:49:01.761
WILL, WOULD BE CREATED, PERHAPS

03:49:01.828 --> 03:49:03.496
WAS HAS BEEN UNDERVALUED. AND I

03:49:03.563 --> 03:49:05.431
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

03:49:05.498 --> 03:49:06.899
MUST ACKNOWLEDGE AND THAT I

03:49:06.966 --> 03:49:09.435
CERTAINLY DO SO TODAY. SO I

03:49:09.502 --> 03:49:11.771
ALSO WANT TO THANK SUSAN CHAN,

03:49:11.838 --> 03:49:13.506
WHO'S THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE, WHO

03:49:13.573 --> 03:49:15.975
REALLY HELPED US OVER THE LAST

03:49:16.042 --> 03:49:17.410
COUPLE OF MONTHS AS WE HAD A

03:49:17.477 --> 03:49:18.478
LOT OF CONVERSATIONS, THE

03:49:18.544 --> 03:49:20.780
CO-CHAIRS ABOUT HAVING THIS

03:49:20.847 --> 03:49:21.814
CONVERSATION AND HOPEFULLY

03:49:21.881 --> 03:49:23.749
PREPARING SOMETHING FOR THE

03:49:23.816 --> 03:49:26.085
PUBLIC TO REALLY GET THAT

03:49:26.152 --> 03:49:27.220
BETTER, UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:49:27.286 --> 03:49:29.722
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TO ACHIEVE

03:49:29.789 --> 03:49:32.425
AS A RESULT OF CONVERSATIONS SO

03:49:32.492 --> 03:49:33.693
THAT WE UNDERSTAND AGAIN WHERE

03:49:33.759 --> 03:49:35.728
WHERE THINGS STAND. AND AGAIN,

03:49:35.795 --> 03:49:37.063
GOING BACK TO MY INITIAL

03:49:37.130 --> 03:49:39.165
COMMENTS, REALLY FOCUSED ON

03:49:39.232 --> 03:49:39.899
ENSURING THAT REACHING OUR

03:49:39.966 --> 03:49:41.934
CLIMATE GOALS COMES AT THE

03:49:42.001 --> 03:49:43.769
APPROPRIATE COST. AND I THINK I

03:49:43.836 --> 03:49:45.371
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE

03:49:45.438 --> 03:49:47.974
WE DON'T WANT TO PRETEND AS IF

03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:49.742
THERE IS NO COST. THE SAME WAY

03:49:49.809 --> 03:49:53.212
WE SHOULDN'T SAY THAT THIS COST

03:49:53.279 --> 03:49:56.482
IS SO PROHIBITIVE THAT IT'S NOT

03:49:56.549 --> 03:49:57.817
WORTH WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED

03:49:57.884 --> 03:49:59.485
SO FAR, AND THAT ACHIEVING OUR

03:49:59.552 --> 03:50:02.121
GOALS OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE

03:50:02.188 --> 03:50:04.690
CHANGE AND AND ALL OF THE THE

03:50:04.757 --> 03:50:07.026
GOALS THAT WE'VE SET HAS A COST,

03:50:07.093 --> 03:50:08.461
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE

03:50:08.528 --> 03:50:10.596
APPROPRIATELY BALANCED WITH

03:50:10.663 --> 03:50:11.898
CALIFORNIANS COSTS. AND I THINK

03:50:11.964 --> 03:50:14.167
THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED HERE

03:50:14.233 --> 03:50:15.535
TODAY DEFINITELY DEMONSTRATE

03:50:15.601 --> 03:50:19.772
THAT. SO THE SELECT COMMITTEE I

03:50:19.839 --> 03:50:22.542
THINK HAS IDENTIFIED THAT, BUT

03:50:22.608 --> 03:50:24.610
IT'S ALSO IDENTIFIED FROM MY

03:50:24.677 --> 03:50:27.113
PERSPECTIVE THAT A LOT OF

03:50:27.180 --> 03:50:29.682
PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WILL RELY

03:50:29.749 --> 03:50:31.517
ON A COMBUSTION ENGINE FOR

03:50:31.584 --> 03:50:33.753
QUITE SOME TIME. AND SO WE'VE

03:50:33.819 --> 03:50:35.688
GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE

03:50:35.755 --> 03:50:37.957
GOING TO GET TO WHERE WE WANT

03:50:38.024 --> 03:50:40.126
TO GO TO IN A COLLECTIVE WAY,

03:50:40.193 --> 03:50:41.961
BY IDENTIFYING ALL OF THE

03:50:42.028 --> 03:50:43.396
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT WERE

03:50:43.462 --> 03:50:45.565
PRESENTED BY THIS LAST PANEL

03:50:45.631 --> 03:50:47.633
AND BY OTHERS, AND BEING VERY

03:50:47.700 --> 03:50:50.236
REALISTIC ABOUT THAT, AND THAT

03:50:50.303 --> 03:50:52.705
THE COST OF MOVING IN THE

03:50:52.772 --> 03:50:54.473
DIRECTION WE WANT TO MOVE INTO

03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:56.776
SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED BY ANY

03:50:56.842 --> 03:50:59.612
ONE PARTICULAR SECTOR OF OUR,

03:50:59.679 --> 03:51:01.581
OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND ONE THING

03:51:01.647 --> 03:51:03.583
THAT WAS SAID, AND I THINK I

03:51:03.649 --> 03:51:04.717
WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE AND HAVE

03:51:04.784 --> 03:51:05.952
ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE PAST, IS

03:51:06.018 --> 03:51:07.486
THAT THE COST OF OF

03:51:07.553 --> 03:51:09.155
ELECTRIFYING AND CERTAINLY

03:51:09.222 --> 03:51:10.890
REDUCING EMISSIONS IN

03:51:10.957 --> 03:51:11.490
TRANSPORTATION SHOULD NOT BE

03:51:11.557 --> 03:51:13.526
BORNE IN THE LONG TERM, WHICH

03:51:13.593 --> 03:51:15.528
IS A VERY HUGE CONCERN OF MINE

03:51:15.595 --> 03:51:17.597
IN THE LONG TERM ON THE BACKS

03:51:17.663 --> 03:51:18.664
OF THOSE WHO, UNFORTUNATELY,

03:51:18.731 --> 03:51:19.665
CANNOT MAKE THAT TRANSITION FOR

03:51:19.732 --> 03:51:21.667
A VARIETY OF REASONS. AND SOME

03:51:21.734 --> 03:51:23.603
OF IT IS, YES, ECONOMICS AND

03:51:23.669 --> 03:51:25.738
AGREE THAT THE PRICE IS COMING

03:51:25.805 --> 03:51:27.440
DOWN OF THOSE VEHICLES AND

03:51:27.506 --> 03:51:28.474
BECOMES MORE ACHIEVABLE FOR

03:51:28.541 --> 03:51:29.809
FAMILIES THAT I REPRESENT. BUT

03:51:29.875 --> 03:51:31.777
SOME OF IT IS JUST LOGISTICAL.

03:51:31.844 --> 03:51:33.379
ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE, AS

03:51:33.446 --> 03:51:34.714
SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN ONE OF THE

03:51:34.780 --> 03:51:37.350
OLDEST COMMUNITIES IN SAN DIEGO,

03:51:37.416 --> 03:51:39.685
YOU KNOW, I ONLY VERY RECENTLY

03:51:39.752 --> 03:51:41.287
UPDATED MY ELECTRICAL PANEL.

03:51:41.354 --> 03:51:42.622
PRIOR TO THAT, THERE WAS NOT

03:51:42.688 --> 03:51:44.790
EVEN A THOUGHT THAT WOULD CROSS

03:51:44.857 --> 03:51:46.525
MY MIND THAT I COULD GET INTO

03:51:46.592 --> 03:51:47.693
AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE. THAT WAS

03:51:47.760 --> 03:51:49.795
NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY

03:51:49.862 --> 03:51:51.430
ACHIEVABLE. SO I'VE SLOWLY,

03:51:51.497 --> 03:51:52.765
OVER THE COURSE OF TIME, AS WE

03:51:52.832 --> 03:51:54.500
ARE A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY, HAVE

03:51:54.567 --> 03:51:56.035
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS

03:51:56.102 --> 03:51:56.736
AND INVESTMENTS IN OUR OWN

03:51:56.802 --> 03:51:58.704
PROPERTY. THAT NOW PUT ME IN A

03:51:58.771 --> 03:52:00.473
POSITION WHERE AS SOON AS YOU

03:52:00.539 --> 03:52:02.842
KNOW, I'M IN A BETTER POSITION

03:52:02.908 --> 03:52:05.044
TO FINANCIALLY AFFORD MAKING A

03:52:05.111 --> 03:52:06.679
PURCHASE OF A NEW VEHICLE, I

03:52:06.746 --> 03:52:07.947
MAY MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION NOW.

03:52:08.014 --> 03:52:09.448
BUT YOU KNOW, PRIOR TO THAT, I

03:52:09.515 --> 03:52:10.750
COULDN'T DO THAT. AND THE

03:52:10.816 --> 03:52:11.884
MAJORITY OF MY NEIGHBORS CANNOT

03:52:11.951 --> 03:52:13.619
DO THAT BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE

03:52:13.686 --> 03:52:14.654
GARAGES, WE DO NOT HAVE

03:52:14.720 --> 03:52:17.023
DRIVEWAYS, WE PARK OUR VEHICLES

03:52:17.089 --> 03:52:17.657
ON THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. AND

03:52:17.723 --> 03:52:19.992
SO THAT'S A REALITY THAT EXISTS

03:52:20.059 --> 03:52:22.161
AND THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

03:52:22.228 --> 03:52:22.762
HOW WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION

03:52:22.828 --> 03:52:24.497
THAT FLEET. BUT ALSO OBVIOUSLY

03:52:24.563 --> 03:52:26.132
HEAVY DUTY FLEET, WHICH I

03:52:26.198 --> 03:52:27.900
REPRESENT THE PORT OF ENTRY.

03:52:27.967 --> 03:52:29.735
AND WE HAVE THOUSANDS, 4000

03:52:29.802 --> 03:52:31.404
VEHICLES, YOU KNOW, CROSSING

03:52:31.470 --> 03:52:32.838
THE BORDER FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY

03:52:32.905 --> 03:52:34.440
THAT HAVE DIFFERENT

03:52:34.507 --> 03:52:35.074
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. AND

03:52:35.141 --> 03:52:37.243
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RELY

03:52:37.310 --> 03:52:38.944
ON A DIFFERENT, POTENTIALLY

03:52:39.011 --> 03:52:43.215
TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO TO MEET

03:52:43.282 --> 03:52:44.850
SOME OF OUR SOME OF OUR GOALS.

03:52:44.917 --> 03:52:46.719
AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT, BUT

03:52:46.786 --> 03:52:47.887
WE'VE GOT TO BE THOUGHTFUL

03:52:47.953 --> 03:52:49.755
ABOUT NOT IMPACTING OUR

03:52:49.822 --> 03:52:50.623
BINATIONAL ECONOMY, WHICH

03:52:50.690 --> 03:52:52.825
DRIVES OUR STATE ECONOMY,

03:52:52.892 --> 03:52:54.460
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS OUR

03:52:54.527 --> 03:52:55.761
MEXICO IS OUR NUMBER ONE

03:52:55.828 --> 03:52:56.796
TRADING PARTNER, AND THAT

03:52:56.862 --> 03:52:57.930
CREATES JOBS FOR ALL OF

03:52:57.997 --> 03:52:59.565
CALIFORNIANS. SO THOSE ARE ALL

03:52:59.632 --> 03:53:01.734
THINGS THAT I THINK ABOUT AS WE

03:53:01.801 --> 03:53:02.501
TALK ABOUT THE TRANSITION. BUT

03:53:02.568 --> 03:53:04.537
CERTAINLY I SEE A PLACE FOR THE

03:53:04.603 --> 03:53:05.705
LCFS IN THIS TRANSITION. THE

03:53:05.771 --> 03:53:07.373
TESTIMONY TODAY REALLY MADE

03:53:07.440 --> 03:53:10.042
THAT CLEAR, AND IT ACTUALLY

03:53:10.109 --> 03:53:11.110
MAKES ME HOPEFUL THAT THE

03:53:11.177 --> 03:53:11.877
INNOVATION THAT HAS OCCURRED

03:53:11.944 --> 03:53:13.446
CAN CONTINUE TO OCCUR. AND WE

03:53:13.512 --> 03:53:15.614
CERTAINLY NEED TO MAKE THIS

03:53:15.681 --> 03:53:17.616
COMMITMENT TODAY, AS WE SEE,

03:53:17.683 --> 03:53:18.851
UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT'S HAPPENING

03:53:18.918 --> 03:53:20.753
FEDERALLY, WITH THE COMMITMENT

03:53:20.820 --> 03:53:23.656
BEING SCALED BACK, WE CANNOT DO

03:53:23.723 --> 03:53:25.558
THE SAME. WE MUST CONTINUE IN

03:53:25.624 --> 03:53:27.660
ORDER TO CREATE SOME STABILITY

03:53:27.727 --> 03:53:28.928
IN THIS MARKET THAT IS OUT

03:53:28.994 --> 03:53:29.729
THERE, AND THE DECISIONS THAT

03:53:29.795 --> 03:53:31.664
GET MADE BY THOSE WHO INVEST

03:53:31.731 --> 03:53:33.399
AND OR ARE SEEKING TO INVEST IN

03:53:33.466 --> 03:53:34.967
NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATION

03:53:35.034 --> 03:53:38.170
AND THIS ECONOMY. SO I WANT TO

03:53:38.237 --> 03:53:40.439
APPRECIATE EVERYBODY ALSO

03:53:40.506 --> 03:53:41.741
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE COST OF

03:53:41.807 --> 03:53:43.476
GAS IS VERY IMPORTANT. THERE

03:53:43.542 --> 03:53:44.744
ARE ANOTHER CONVERSATION THAT

03:53:44.810 --> 03:53:46.779
WE'RE HAVING ABOUT THAT, THAT I

03:53:46.846 --> 03:53:48.647
THINK WE'LL SEE SOME POSITIVE

03:53:48.714 --> 03:53:50.583
MOVEMENT IN THAT REGARD. SOME

03:53:50.649 --> 03:53:51.984
OF US HAVE BILLS AROUND

03:53:52.051 --> 03:53:53.719
REDUCING THE COST OF GASOLINE

03:53:53.786 --> 03:53:56.689
IN OTHER WAYS. AND SO I THINK

03:53:56.756 --> 03:53:58.557
THAT CONVERSATION MUST REMAIN,

03:53:58.624 --> 03:53:59.825
BUT IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE

03:53:59.892 --> 03:54:02.528
FOCUSED SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND,

03:54:02.595 --> 03:54:04.997
YOU KNOW, UNDERMINING LCFS IS

03:54:05.064 --> 03:54:06.999
CERTAINLY NOT MY CONCLUSION AS

03:54:07.066 --> 03:54:10.002
OF TODAY, THE PLACE WHERE WE

03:54:10.069 --> 03:54:10.569
NEED TO DO THAT. SO, MADAM

03:54:10.636 --> 03:54:12.738
CHAIR, THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR

03:54:12.805 --> 03:54:14.740
WORK AS WELL AND YOUR STAFF FOR

03:54:14.807 --> 03:54:15.608
GETTING US HERE TODAY. THANK

03:54:15.674 --> 03:54:17.076
YOU. SAME THING. I APPRECIATE

03:54:17.143 --> 03:54:18.411
YOUR YOUR ENGAGEMENT FROM THE

03:54:18.477 --> 03:54:19.578
VERY BEGINNING WHEN WE WERE

03:54:19.645 --> 03:54:21.747
DESIGNATED CO-CHAIRS AND HAVE

03:54:21.814 --> 03:54:23.416
LOVED WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS

03:54:23.482 --> 03:54:24.517
AND BRINGING THIS TOGETHER. AND

03:54:24.583 --> 03:54:25.751
TO YOUR POINT, THE STAFF THAT

03:54:25.818 --> 03:54:27.953
HAS BEEN INVOLVED FROM BOTH OF

03:54:28.020 --> 03:54:29.088
OUR OFFICE, TRANSPORTATION

03:54:29.155 --> 03:54:30.589
COMMITTEE STAFF AND SUSAN CHAN

03:54:30.656 --> 03:54:31.891
OF THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE HAS

03:54:31.957 --> 03:54:33.058
BEEN PHENOMENAL. MY CO-CHAIR

03:54:33.125 --> 03:54:35.761
DOES HAVE TO CATCH A FLIGHT. SO

03:54:35.828 --> 03:54:37.329
WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO

03:54:37.396 --> 03:54:39.765
LET HIM GO. AND WHILE HE DOES

03:54:39.832 --> 03:54:41.700
THAT, WE'LL MOVE IT BACK TO

03:54:41.767 --> 03:54:42.902
COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY

03:54:42.968 --> 03:54:44.804
QUESTIONS. AND WE'LL DO REMARKS

03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:45.704
AT THE END. HE'S DOING THEM

03:54:45.771 --> 03:54:47.673
BECAUSE HE HAD TO LEAVE. SO IF

03:54:47.740 --> 03:54:48.808
THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OF OUR

03:54:48.874 --> 03:54:50.810
PANEL, I WANT TO TURN IT OVER

03:54:50.876 --> 03:54:51.677
TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

03:54:51.744 --> 03:54:53.979
COMMITTEE BEFORE I GET INTO

03:54:54.046 --> 03:54:55.080
MINE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COLLINS.

03:54:55.147 --> 03:54:56.649
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. AND THANK

03:54:56.715 --> 03:54:58.784
YOU SO MUCH, CHAIR AND CO-CHAIR.

03:54:58.851 --> 03:55:00.052
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A PHENOMENAL

03:55:00.119 --> 03:55:02.721
JOB, AND I DO SHARE IN THE SAME

03:55:02.788 --> 03:55:04.089
SENTIMENTS OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

03:55:04.156 --> 03:55:06.525
FROM SAN DIEGO HAS SAID. THOSE

03:55:06.592 --> 03:55:07.893
ARE THINGS THAT WE DEFINITELY

03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:09.428
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO.

03:55:09.495 --> 03:55:11.764
AND SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF

03:55:11.831 --> 03:55:18.037
QUESTIONS. AS FOR MR. WADE. AND

03:55:18.103 --> 03:55:23.976
ALSO MICHAEL SKVARLA. ALL RIGHT.

03:55:24.043 --> 03:55:26.479
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

03:55:26.545 --> 03:55:29.381
FOR YOU BOTH. AND SAFE TRAVELS.

03:55:29.448 --> 03:55:35.688
YES. AND LISTENING TO YOUR YOUR

03:55:35.754 --> 03:55:37.923
PRESENTATIONS, A COUPLE OF

03:55:37.990 --> 03:55:38.791
THINGS WAS COMING TO MIND. ONE

03:55:38.858 --> 03:55:40.726
OF THEM, AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK

03:55:40.793 --> 03:55:42.795
ABOUT THE THE LCFS PROCESS, I'M

03:55:42.862 --> 03:55:45.498
ALWAYS GETTING LCFS. I'M ON MY

03:55:45.564 --> 03:55:48.367
EDUCATION SIDE. I DO THE SAME

03:55:48.434 --> 03:55:52.671
THING. THIS ONE IS FOR FOR MR.

03:55:52.738 --> 03:55:55.007
WADE. WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

03:55:55.074 --> 03:55:57.743
THE LCFS STOPPED INCENTIVIZING

03:55:57.810 --> 03:56:00.546
DAIRY DIGESTER PROJECTS? YEAH,

03:56:00.613 --> 03:56:01.780
THERE THERE ACTUALLY HAS BEEN

03:56:01.847 --> 03:56:03.382
SOME LEGISLATIVE WORK LOOKING

03:56:03.449 --> 03:56:06.018
AT THIS. AND IF IT HAD TO BE

03:56:06.085 --> 03:56:07.019
REPLACED WITH DIRECT FUNDING

03:56:07.086 --> 03:56:08.554
FROM FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR

03:56:08.621 --> 03:56:09.922
SOME OTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING,

03:56:09.989 --> 03:56:12.424
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE 3 TO $4

03:56:12.491 --> 03:56:14.693
BILLION A HIT. SO THE LCFS IS

03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:16.462
FUNDING APPROXIMATELY, YOU KNOW,

03:56:16.529 --> 03:56:18.764
THAT DIRECT CAPITAL INVESTMENT

03:56:18.831 --> 03:56:19.798
IN THESE PROJECTS, THERE IS

03:56:19.865 --> 03:56:21.534
ONGOING OPERATING COSTS TO KEEP

03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:23.002
THEM RUNNING AS WELL. BUT IF

03:56:23.068 --> 03:56:24.670
THERE WAS ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE

03:56:24.737 --> 03:56:25.437
FUNDING SOURCE, THAT'S THE

03:56:25.504 --> 03:56:28.974
GENERAL MAGNITUDE OF IT. OKAY.

03:56:29.041 --> 03:56:30.476
THANK YOU. AND THEN WHEN WE

03:56:30.543 --> 03:56:32.144
WERE WHEN YOU WERE TALKING

03:56:32.211 --> 03:56:34.446
ABOUT BENEFITS, SO WHAT WHAT

03:56:34.513 --> 03:56:35.981
BENEFITS CAN WE SAY THAT

03:56:36.048 --> 03:56:38.050
CALIFORNIA RECEIVES FROM THE

03:56:38.117 --> 03:56:39.552
IN-STATE METHANE CAPTURE AT THE

03:56:39.618 --> 03:56:41.687
DAIRIES? THERE ARE AIR QUALITY

03:56:41.754 --> 03:56:42.955
IMPROVEMENTS BOTH WITH RESPECT

03:56:43.022 --> 03:56:45.524
TO ODOR AND WITH RESPECT TO

03:56:45.591 --> 03:56:48.260
SOME, SOME OF THE HAZARDOUS

03:56:48.327 --> 03:56:49.528
GASES ASSOCIATED WITH MANURE

03:56:49.595 --> 03:56:51.230
COLLECTION, INCLUDING HYDROGEN

03:56:51.297 --> 03:56:52.565
SULFIDE. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO,

03:56:52.631 --> 03:56:54.366
OF COURSE, THE GREEN JOB

03:56:54.433 --> 03:56:55.901
BENEFITS AND THE FACT THAT

03:56:55.968 --> 03:56:57.536
THESE ARE WELL-PAID ENERGY JOBS

03:56:57.603 --> 03:56:59.572
IN REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT

03:56:59.638 --> 03:57:01.373
MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE THOSE

03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:05.411
TYPES OF OF OPPORTUNITIES. SO,

03:57:05.477 --> 03:57:07.513
OKAY, BY THAT BEING A BENEFIT,

03:57:07.580 --> 03:57:09.648
THEN WHY IS THE OUT OF STATE

03:57:09.715 --> 03:57:10.449
PRODUCTION OF THE RENEWABLE

03:57:10.516 --> 03:57:11.550
NATURAL GAS IMPORTANT FOR

03:57:11.617 --> 03:57:13.352
CALIFORNIA? I KNOW YOU

03:57:13.419 --> 03:57:14.787
MENTIONED THAT WE RELY HEAVILY

03:57:14.853 --> 03:57:17.623
ON ON OUR IMPORTS. SO WHY IS

03:57:17.690 --> 03:57:19.758
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE

03:57:19.825 --> 03:57:21.594
OUT-OF-STATE PRODUCTION IS IS

03:57:21.660 --> 03:57:23.896
IMPORTANT FOR US, RIGHT. SO OF

03:57:23.963 --> 03:57:25.998
COURSE WE LOVE THE IN-STATE

03:57:26.065 --> 03:57:27.132
PROJECTS. THOSE ARE FANTASTIC.

03:57:27.199 --> 03:57:28.434
AND OUR MEMBERS ARE VERY HAPPY

03:57:28.500 --> 03:57:29.702
TO BUILD THEM IN CALIFORNIA.

03:57:29.768 --> 03:57:30.803
BUT OUT-OF-STATE COMPETITION IS

03:57:30.869 --> 03:57:33.405
GOOD FOR CONSUMERS, JUST AS IT

03:57:33.472 --> 03:57:35.741
IS FOR ANY FUEL. IF YOU HAVE

03:57:35.808 --> 03:57:37.710
TOO LIMITED OF A MARKET, THEN

03:57:37.776 --> 03:57:38.711
THE PRICE THAT YOU WILL PAY IN

03:57:38.777 --> 03:57:41.146
THAT MARKET WILL BE HIGHER. AND

03:57:41.213 --> 03:57:41.880
BECAUSE WE'RE SO FOCUSED ON

03:57:41.947 --> 03:57:42.548
AFFORDABILITY, WE THINK

03:57:42.615 --> 03:57:44.750
REMAINING VERY OPEN TO IMPORTS

03:57:44.817 --> 03:57:46.719
IS SMART POLICY, AND IT ALSO

03:57:46.785 --> 03:57:47.519
PROVIDES LEADERSHIP FOR THE

03:57:47.586 --> 03:57:49.622
REST OF THE COUNTRY. WHEN

03:57:49.688 --> 03:57:50.789
THERE'S A RENEWABLE FUEL

03:57:50.856 --> 03:57:52.558
FACILITY, INCLUDING RNG

03:57:52.625 --> 03:57:53.626
ESTABLISHED OUTSIDE OF

03:57:53.692 --> 03:57:55.494
CALIFORNIA, YOU'VE PUT A VOICE

03:57:55.561 --> 03:57:58.097
IN THAT STATE THAT CARES ABOUT

03:57:58.163 --> 03:57:59.765
CLIMATE ACTION AND CARES ABOUT

03:57:59.832 --> 03:58:00.833
IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:58:00.899 --> 03:58:02.768
PERFORMANCE, YOU KNOW, IN THESE

03:58:02.835 --> 03:58:04.670
INDUSTRIES, AND THEN THEY CAN

03:58:04.737 --> 03:58:05.804
ADVOCATE FOR SIMILAR POLICIES

03:58:05.871 --> 03:58:08.807
IN THAT JURISDICTION. THANK YOU.

03:58:08.874 --> 03:58:11.377
I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING MY

03:58:11.443 --> 03:58:13.746
QUESTIONS. GOING OVER TO MR.

03:58:13.812 --> 03:58:16.081
KAVALA. AM I SAYING IT RIGHT?

03:58:16.148 --> 03:58:18.517
SURE. OH, OKAY. HE'S LIKE,

03:58:18.584 --> 03:58:20.586
HOWEVER, WHATEVER YOU GOT. NO.

03:58:20.653 --> 03:58:22.521
STILL TALKING ABOUT HYDROGEN? I

03:58:22.588 --> 03:58:23.656
HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE A

03:58:23.722 --> 03:58:24.890
CONVERSATION EARLIER TODAY AS

03:58:24.957 --> 03:58:26.659
WELL AS PERTAINS TO HYDROGEN,

03:58:26.725 --> 03:58:27.660
BUT I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF

03:58:27.726 --> 03:58:30.062
GET A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY

03:58:30.129 --> 03:58:31.697
ON HOW HYDROGEN BENEFITS ARE

03:58:31.764 --> 03:58:34.299
ACTUALLY CAPTURED HERE IN

03:58:34.366 --> 03:58:34.833
CALIFORNIA. I JUST NEED A

03:58:34.900 --> 03:58:36.368
LITTLE MORE CLARIFICATION ON

03:58:36.435 --> 03:58:38.604
THAT. YEAH. SO THE MOST OF THE

03:58:38.671 --> 03:58:40.406
BENEFITS ACCRUE AT THE STATION

03:58:40.472 --> 03:58:42.808
LEVEL. SO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY

03:58:42.875 --> 03:58:44.710
CREDITS, JUST LIKE THEIR FAST

03:58:44.777 --> 03:58:45.878
CHARGING CAPACITY CREDITS WHICH

03:58:45.944 --> 03:58:48.847
SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING CAPITAL

03:58:48.914 --> 03:58:50.582
INVESTMENT TO BUILD THIS

03:58:50.649 --> 03:58:52.618
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ALSO HAVE

03:58:52.685 --> 03:58:53.819
IN-STATE PRODUCTION AND SOME

03:58:53.886 --> 03:58:54.753
ADJACENT STATE PRODUCTION. SO

03:58:54.820 --> 03:58:56.722
YOU HAVE TRANSPORTATION, YOU

03:58:56.789 --> 03:58:58.657
KNOW, JOBS MOVING THE HYDROGEN

03:58:58.724 --> 03:59:00.726
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL AS

03:59:00.793 --> 03:59:01.794
THE PRODUCTION JOBS AT THE

03:59:01.860 --> 03:59:03.562
FACILITIES THAT ARE BEING

03:59:03.629 --> 03:59:05.597
UPGRADED RIGHT NOW IN THANKS TO

03:59:05.664 --> 03:59:07.366
A COUPLE CÁC GRANTS THAT HAVE

03:59:07.433 --> 03:59:08.734
HAPPENED. SO WE HAVE A FACILITY

03:59:08.801 --> 03:59:11.103
IN ONTARIO, CALIFORNIA THAT'S

03:59:11.170 --> 03:59:12.571
ADDING CAPACITY. WE HAVE A

03:59:12.638 --> 03:59:14.540
NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT ARE

03:59:14.606 --> 03:59:15.841
ANNOUNCED UNDER THE HYDROGEN

03:59:15.908 --> 03:59:17.242
HUB, CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN HUB,

03:59:17.309 --> 03:59:18.944
WHICH IS THE LARGEST IN THE

03:59:19.011 --> 03:59:21.013
COUNTRY, ALL RENEWABLE, ALL

03:59:21.080 --> 03:59:23.549
JOBS ASSOCIATED WITH

03:59:23.615 --> 03:59:25.684
CONSTRUCTION AT A HYDROGEN

03:59:25.751 --> 03:59:27.019
FACILITY ARE SKILLED AND

03:59:27.086 --> 03:59:29.722
TRAINED. SO THESE ARE UNION

03:59:29.788 --> 03:59:31.757
FAMILY SUSTAINING JOBS WITH ALL

03:59:31.824 --> 03:59:34.860
THE APPRENTICE REQUIREMENTS AND

03:59:34.927 --> 03:59:36.095
THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES. SO

03:59:36.161 --> 03:59:37.863
IT'S IT'S A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL

03:59:37.930 --> 03:59:41.633
IN TERMS OF OF HOW THOSE

03:59:41.700 --> 03:59:43.235
BENEFITS ACCRUE. BUT WE ALSO

03:59:43.302 --> 03:59:44.436
HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT

03:59:44.503 --> 03:59:45.771
OF GOING THROUGH A FUEL CELL.

03:59:45.838 --> 03:59:46.972
SO THERE'S ZERO EMISSIONS AT

03:59:47.039 --> 03:59:48.640
THE TAILPIPE. THERE'S NO

03:59:48.707 --> 03:59:50.576
TAILPIPE I MEAN IT'S DISTILLED

03:59:50.642 --> 03:59:51.744
WATER. IT DOESN'T TASTE VERY

03:59:51.810 --> 03:59:54.546
GOOD. BUT IT'S IT'S CLEAN. AND

03:59:54.613 --> 03:59:56.749
SO ANY ANY MILE DRIVEN THROUGH

03:59:56.815 --> 03:59:59.651
COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE PORT IS,

03:59:59.718 --> 04:00:02.921
IS ZERO EMISSION QUIETER. NO

04:00:02.988 --> 04:00:04.590
NOX, NO PM. SO NOTHING THAT'S

04:00:04.656 --> 04:00:06.391
GOING TO CAUSE ASTHMA OR CANCER.

04:00:06.458 --> 04:00:09.428
SO THOSE ARE NOT QUANTIFIED IN

04:00:09.495 --> 04:00:11.530
THE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. BUT

04:00:11.597 --> 04:00:13.599
IF YOU LOOKED AT, SAY, THE

04:00:13.665 --> 04:00:14.399
EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS IN

04:00:14.466 --> 04:00:16.668
THE SOUTH COAST AQMD, IT'S IN

04:00:16.735 --> 04:00:17.803
THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:20.205
DOLLARS A YEAR IN TERMS OF

04:00:20.272 --> 04:00:21.039
VALUE THAT IS REDUCED FROM

04:00:21.106 --> 04:00:22.474
HAVING HYDROGEN DEPLOYED IN IN

04:00:22.541 --> 04:00:24.443
THE COMMUNITIES AND LCFS

04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:26.745
ULTIMATELY, IS THE THE ONE

04:00:26.812 --> 04:00:29.348
POLICY THAT STILL REMAINS IN,

04:00:29.414 --> 04:00:30.516
AS CAITLIN MENTIONED, ACTIONS

04:00:30.582 --> 04:00:32.985
BY CONGRESS AND THE TRUMP

04:00:33.051 --> 04:00:34.019
ADMINISTRATION HAVE REALLY

04:00:34.086 --> 04:00:35.721
UNDERMINED WHAT WAS GOING TO BE

04:00:35.788 --> 04:00:37.322
A NATIONAL MOVEMENT IN THIS IN

04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:39.324
CALIFORNIA, IS IS STAYING, YOU

04:00:39.391 --> 04:00:40.893
KNOW, KIND OF STALWART BASED ON

04:00:40.959 --> 04:00:44.563
POLICIES LIKE THE LCFS. SO

04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:45.831
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU JUST

04:00:45.898 --> 04:00:47.432
MENTIONED, TOO, THAT WE HAVE

04:00:47.499 --> 04:00:48.567
THE OUT-OF-STATE PRODUCTION AS

04:00:48.634 --> 04:00:50.669
AS WELL, WE DON'T GO THAT FAR

04:00:50.736 --> 04:00:53.205
WITH HYDROGEN, TO BE HONEST.

04:00:53.272 --> 04:00:55.707
IT'S, YOU KNOW, SO THERE'S A

04:00:55.774 --> 04:00:56.675
FACILITY JUST OVER THE SIDE OF

04:00:56.742 --> 04:00:58.644
THE BORDER IN NEVADA, BUT MOST

04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:59.912
OF THE PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA

04:00:59.978 --> 04:01:01.480
IS MOST OF THE FUEL THAT IS

04:01:01.547 --> 04:01:03.115
BEING DELIVERED IN CALIFORNIA

04:01:03.182 --> 04:01:04.783
IS FROM CALIFORNIA. OKAY. AND

04:01:04.850 --> 04:01:06.585
JUST KIND OF JUST JUST

04:01:06.652 --> 04:01:09.054
BRANCHING OFF A LITTLE BIT WHEN

04:01:09.121 --> 04:01:12.224
IT COMES TO THE HYDROGEN FUEL

04:01:12.291 --> 04:01:13.392
ITSELF, WHAT IS THE DISTANCE

04:01:13.458 --> 04:01:15.160
THAT A PERSON CAN CAN ACTUALLY

04:01:15.227 --> 04:01:18.197
DRIVE? YEAH. SO IN TRAVEL WITH

04:01:18.263 --> 04:01:19.431
BY USING HYDROGEN COMPARED TO

04:01:19.498 --> 04:01:21.600
THE OTHER. SO IT DEPENDS ON

04:01:21.667 --> 04:01:23.936
WHICH WHICH CAR YOU GET. BUT

04:01:24.002 --> 04:01:27.372
THE AVERAGE FILL IS IS

04:01:27.439 --> 04:01:31.510
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 350 AND 275

04:01:31.577 --> 04:01:34.379
MILES PER FILL UP A KILOGRAM IS

04:01:34.446 --> 04:01:35.781
ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO A GALLON

04:01:35.848 --> 04:01:36.682
OF GASOLINE. AND SO THE CARS

04:01:36.748 --> 04:01:38.617
TAKE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE AND

04:01:38.684 --> 04:01:40.719
6.5KG. TODAY, THE HEAVY DUTY

04:01:40.786 --> 04:01:42.521
TRUCKS ARE SEEING SOME PRETTY

04:01:42.588 --> 04:01:46.692
WE THERE'S A A PHD AT LAWRENCE

04:01:46.758 --> 04:01:48.794
LIVERMORE. THAT'S ONE OF THOSE

04:01:48.861 --> 04:01:49.895
HIGH PROFILE GUYS THAT HAS DONE

04:01:49.962 --> 04:01:52.431
FAR MORE THAN THAT PER, PER.

04:01:52.497 --> 04:01:54.566
FILL UP. BUT, YOU KNOW, INSTEAD

04:01:54.633 --> 04:01:56.568
WE'VE SET SOME RECORDS IN THE,

04:01:56.635 --> 04:01:59.371
YOU KNOW, FIVE, 600 MILE RANGE.

04:01:59.438 --> 04:02:01.940
BUT THE TRUCKS ARE DOING FULL

04:02:02.007 --> 04:02:02.774
ROUTES. THEY'RE ABLE TO REFUEL

04:02:02.841 --> 04:02:05.644
IN 15 TO 20 MINUTES. IF YOU

04:02:05.711 --> 04:02:07.713
NEED TO CHANGE SHIFTS, YOU CAN

04:02:07.779 --> 04:02:08.981
PUT A DIFFERENT DRIVER IN THE

04:02:09.047 --> 04:02:10.582
SEAT AND CONTINUE TO RUN IT.

04:02:10.649 --> 04:02:12.384
WE'RE ALSO SEEING GREAT

04:02:12.451 --> 04:02:13.552
EXAMPLES IN THE TRANSIT

04:02:13.619 --> 04:02:16.989
COMMUNITIES. SO A LOT OF THE

04:02:17.055 --> 04:02:18.023
TRANSIT CALIFORNIA HAS THE

04:02:18.090 --> 04:02:19.925
INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT RULE,

04:02:19.992 --> 04:02:21.159
WHICH IS REQUIRING A TRANSITION

04:02:21.226 --> 04:02:21.894
TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN

04:02:21.960 --> 04:02:24.496
THAT SPACE. HYDROGEN IS BEING

04:02:24.563 --> 04:02:25.831
ADOPTED BY A LOT OF TRANSIT

04:02:25.898 --> 04:02:28.000
DISTRICTS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND

04:02:28.066 --> 04:02:31.069
SUNLINE AND GOLDEN STATE AND

04:02:31.136 --> 04:02:32.304
FOOTHILL HAVE ALL BEEN KIND OF

04:02:32.371 --> 04:02:33.739
PIONEERS IN THAT SPACE. AND

04:02:33.805 --> 04:02:35.574
THERE'S A STUDY OUT OF STANFORD,

04:02:35.641 --> 04:02:37.643
WHICH DOES A FIVE BY FIVE

04:02:37.709 --> 04:02:38.744
ANALYSIS AND SHOWS THAT THE

04:02:38.810 --> 04:02:40.646
UPTIME OF THE FUEL CELL BUSSES,

04:02:40.712 --> 04:02:42.581
VERY COMPARABLE IN TERMS OF

04:02:42.648 --> 04:02:44.750
TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP TO A

04:02:44.816 --> 04:02:46.919
DIESEL. SO WE ARE DIRECT ONE

04:02:46.985 --> 04:02:48.053
FOR ONE REPLACEMENT IN A NUMBER

04:02:48.120 --> 04:02:49.554
OF SEGMENTS. THANK YOU. DOES

04:02:49.621 --> 04:02:52.691
ANYONE ELSE WANT TO. YES, I

04:02:52.758 --> 04:02:55.661
JUST WANTED TO RESPOND QUICKLY

04:02:55.727 --> 04:02:57.696
TO MR. WADE. YOUR QUESTION IS

04:02:57.763 --> 04:03:00.599
TO MR. WADE. I DID WE WORK, YOU

04:03:00.666 --> 04:03:02.834
KNOW, KIND OF DAILY WITH

04:03:02.901 --> 04:03:04.503
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO LIVE NEAR

04:03:04.569 --> 04:03:06.104
THEIR LARGE SCALE DAIRIES,

04:03:06.171 --> 04:03:07.806
DAIRY DIGESTERS AND THE

04:03:07.873 --> 04:03:09.708
COMMUNITIES THAT WANT PIXLEY,

04:03:09.775 --> 04:03:11.410
CALIFORNIA, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT'S

04:03:11.476 --> 04:03:12.611
NEAR THE THE HIGHEST

04:03:12.678 --> 04:03:13.979
CONCENTRATION OF LARGE SCALE

04:03:14.046 --> 04:03:17.549
DAIRIES AND DAIRY DIGESTERS HAS

04:03:17.616 --> 04:03:18.750
EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN

04:03:18.817 --> 04:03:20.218
ODORS SINCE THE ADVENT OF

04:03:20.285 --> 04:03:24.356
DIGESTERS. COULD COULD

04:03:24.423 --> 04:03:27.159
CONJECTURE AS TO WHY, BUT WE'RE

04:03:27.225 --> 04:03:29.227
NOT HEARING THAT PEOPLE ARE

04:03:29.294 --> 04:03:30.462
EXPERIENCING ANY BENEFITS AND

04:03:30.529 --> 04:03:34.066
IN FACT, EXPERIENCING INCREASED

04:03:34.132 --> 04:03:35.133
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION.

04:03:35.200 --> 04:03:36.835
NUISANCE. ET CETERA. AND I YOU

04:03:36.902 --> 04:03:38.837
KNOW, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A

04:03:38.904 --> 04:03:39.538
LONGER CONVERSATION. I KNOW

04:03:39.604 --> 04:03:41.573
THIS IS THIS CONVERSATION IS

04:03:41.640 --> 04:03:42.741
SUCH AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION

04:03:42.808 --> 04:03:44.509
AND PLACED AT, AT SUCH A HECTIC

04:03:44.576 --> 04:03:45.711
TIME, BUT HOPING THAT WE CAN

04:03:45.777 --> 04:03:47.446
SPEND SOME MORE TIME KIND OF

04:03:47.512 --> 04:03:49.548
DIGGING INTO THOSE NUMBERS AND

04:03:49.614 --> 04:03:51.683
UNDERSTANDING BETTER WHAT THIS

04:03:51.750 --> 04:03:52.651
3 TO $4 BILLION NUMBER IS. I

04:03:52.718 --> 04:03:54.886
THINK A LOT OF THE NUMBERS THAT

04:03:54.953 --> 04:03:56.455
WE'VE SEEN, AND A LOT OF THE

04:03:56.521 --> 04:03:58.256
PROJECTIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN

04:03:58.323 --> 04:03:58.890
PROJECT SIGNIFICANT,

04:03:58.957 --> 04:04:01.893
SIGNIFICANT PROFITS TO THE TO

04:04:01.960 --> 04:04:03.962
DEVELOPERS OF BIOGAS AND

04:04:04.029 --> 04:04:05.464
LIVESTOCK, BIOGAS. AND SO I

04:04:05.530 --> 04:04:07.632
DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF THAT 3 TO

04:04:07.699 --> 04:04:10.102
$4 BILLION INCLUDES THAT. I

04:04:10.168 --> 04:04:10.869
THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT

04:04:10.936 --> 04:04:12.671
WITH LCFS, ALONG WITH THE TAX

04:04:12.738 --> 04:04:14.906
CREDITS DISCUSSED EARLIER, IN

04:04:14.973 --> 04:04:15.974
ADDITION TO RAIN, IN ADDITION

04:04:16.041 --> 04:04:17.576
TO THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

04:04:17.642 --> 04:04:19.411
MILLION DOLLARS OF DRP GRANTS

04:04:19.478 --> 04:04:21.613
AND CPUC GRANTS THAT THAT

04:04:21.680 --> 04:04:24.483
BIOGAS DEVELOPERS ARE ENJOYING

04:04:24.549 --> 04:04:26.985
A SIGNIFICANT PROFIT OVER AND

04:04:27.052 --> 04:04:29.054
ABOVE THE COST OF PRODUCING THE

04:04:29.121 --> 04:04:32.657
FUEL. IF I CAN, MADAM CHAIR, I

04:04:32.724 --> 04:04:33.525
WOULD APPRECIATE A COUPLE OF

04:04:33.592 --> 04:04:35.060
OPPORTUNITIES TO CLEAR UP A

04:04:35.127 --> 04:04:36.895
COUPLE OF POINTS. MISS SEATON,

04:04:36.962 --> 04:04:38.530
IN HER OPENING COMMENTS, TALKED

04:04:38.597 --> 04:04:39.798
ABOUT ALLEGED METHANE

04:04:39.865 --> 04:04:42.768
REDUCTIONS FROM THESE PROJECTS.

04:04:42.834 --> 04:04:44.002
THAT'S COMPLETELY WITHOUT ANY

04:04:44.069 --> 04:04:45.704
FACTUAL BASIS. THERE WAS JUST A

04:04:45.771 --> 04:04:47.439
STUDY COMPLETED BY UC RIVERSIDE

04:04:47.506 --> 04:04:49.107
THAT SHOWED THE REDUCTION WAS

04:04:49.174 --> 04:04:53.645
AT FULL, 82% REDUCTION. THE

04:04:53.712 --> 04:04:55.547
BENEFITS FROM AN AIR QUALITY

04:04:55.614 --> 04:04:57.616
PERSPECTIVE ARE EQUALLY WELL

04:04:57.682 --> 04:04:58.750
DOCUMENTED. WE'RE CONVERTING

04:04:58.817 --> 04:05:01.486
DIESEL TRUCKS TO RUN ON CLEAN,

04:05:01.553 --> 04:05:03.755
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS, AND

04:05:03.822 --> 04:05:05.557
THOSE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS ARE

04:05:05.624 --> 04:05:06.825
ACCRUING TO THE COMMUNITIES

04:05:06.892 --> 04:05:09.061
THAT MISS SEATON REPRESENTS IN

04:05:09.127 --> 04:05:10.829
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THEY'RE

04:05:10.896 --> 04:05:11.563
ACCRUING TO DISADVANTAGED

04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:12.798
COMMUNITIES NEAR PORTS AND

04:05:12.864 --> 04:05:14.800
OTHER PLACES WHERE THOSE TRUCKS

04:05:14.866 --> 04:05:16.601
FREQUENT, NEAR WAREHOUSES WHERE

04:05:16.668 --> 04:05:17.769
THOSE TRUCKS FREQUENT. THOSE

04:05:17.836 --> 04:05:19.538
BENEFITS ARE VERY REAL, AND

04:05:19.604 --> 04:05:21.973
THEY ALSO PROVIDE TREMENDOUS

04:05:22.040 --> 04:05:23.909
NUISANCE BENEFITS. WE'RE

04:05:23.975 --> 04:05:26.378
CAPTURING NOT JUST METHANE, BUT

04:05:26.445 --> 04:05:28.513
WE'RE ALSO CAPTURING HYDROGEN

04:05:28.580 --> 04:05:30.682
SULFIDE, WHICH IS THE GAS THAT

04:05:30.749 --> 04:05:32.884
CAUSES ODORS FROM DAIRIES AND

04:05:32.951 --> 04:05:35.253
MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER AGENCIES.

04:05:35.320 --> 04:05:36.588
THAT'S DOCUMENTED FACT. WE HAVE

04:05:36.655 --> 04:05:38.757
TO CLEAN IT OUT OF THE FUEL.

04:05:38.824 --> 04:05:41.159
WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO THAT IN

04:05:41.226 --> 04:05:42.060
OUR PROJECTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

04:05:42.127 --> 04:05:43.795
TO GET THE GRANTS THAT SHE

04:05:43.862 --> 04:05:47.599
REFERENCED. IF WE GOT RID OF

04:05:47.666 --> 04:05:49.534
DAIRY IN THE LCFS, NOT ONLY

04:05:49.601 --> 04:05:51.503
WOULD THE PROJECTS THAT ARE

04:05:51.570 --> 04:05:52.737
OPERATING TODAY CEASE TO

04:05:52.804 --> 04:05:53.872
OPERATE, THERE'D BE NO NEW

04:05:53.939 --> 04:05:55.507
PROJECTS. THERE'D BE ZERO

04:05:55.574 --> 04:05:57.943
ABILITY BY THE INDUSTRY TO

04:05:58.009 --> 04:05:59.478
ACHIEVE THE 40% REDUCTION THAT

04:05:59.544 --> 04:06:01.713
WE'RE SO CLOSE TO ACHIEVING.

04:06:01.780 --> 04:06:03.482
IT'S A SIMPLE FACT. THOSE

04:06:03.548 --> 04:06:04.616
DIGESTERS RIGHT NOW ARE

04:06:04.683 --> 04:06:05.750
PROVIDING HALF OF THE

04:06:05.817 --> 04:06:08.353
REDUCTIONS. I TALKED ABOUT.

04:06:08.420 --> 04:06:10.055
ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF

04:06:10.122 --> 04:06:11.656
THE REDUCTIONS ARE COMING FROM

04:06:11.723 --> 04:06:14.559
ATTRITION. FEWER COWS. MISS

04:06:14.626 --> 04:06:16.261
SEATON AND OTHERS HAVE CLAIMED

04:06:16.328 --> 04:06:17.529
THAT THESE PROJECTS ARE CAUSING

04:06:17.596 --> 04:06:18.697
AN EXPANSION OF THE DAIRY

04:06:18.763 --> 04:06:20.398
SECTOR. NOTHING COULD BE

04:06:20.465 --> 04:06:23.935
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. WE HAVE

04:06:24.002 --> 04:06:25.370
200,000 PLUS FEWER COWS IN

04:06:25.437 --> 04:06:28.673
CALIFORNIA TODAY THAN WE HAD IN

04:06:28.740 --> 04:06:29.908
2008, AND THE TREND WILL

04:06:29.975 --> 04:06:31.710
CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION.

04:06:31.776 --> 04:06:33.645
WE'RE NOT BUILDING NEW DAIRIES

04:06:33.712 --> 04:06:35.447
IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVEN'T IN

04:06:35.514 --> 04:06:37.782
TEN YEARS. AND SO WE'RE LOSING

04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:39.451
DAIRIES, WE'RE LOSING COWS,

04:06:39.518 --> 04:06:40.819
WE'RE LOSING FAMILIES THAT HAVE

04:06:40.886 --> 04:06:43.388
FARMED IN THIS STATE FOR

04:06:43.455 --> 04:06:45.457
DECADES, AND WE'RE GOING TO

04:06:45.524 --> 04:06:47.692
LOSE JOBS AND REVENUES TO LOCAL

04:06:47.759 --> 04:06:49.427
COMMUNITIES AS THIS TREND

04:06:49.494 --> 04:06:50.729
CONTINUES. THERE ARE LOTS OF

04:06:50.795 --> 04:06:52.731
FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING THAT

04:06:52.797 --> 04:06:54.566
REDUCTION. YOU KNOW, METHANE

04:06:54.633 --> 04:06:56.701
REGULATION ON TOP OF THOSE

04:06:56.768 --> 04:06:57.536
OTHER DRIVERS, SUCH AS THE

04:06:57.602 --> 04:06:58.737
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

04:06:58.803 --> 04:07:01.039
MANAGEMENT ACT, AS WELL AS

04:07:01.106 --> 04:07:01.640
WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS, AS

04:07:01.706 --> 04:07:03.608
WELL AS OTHER REGULATIONS THAT

04:07:03.675 --> 04:07:06.044
DAIRIES FACE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

04:07:06.111 --> 04:07:07.646
THEY DON'T FACE IN OTHER STATES,

04:07:07.712 --> 04:07:09.147
WOULD DRIVE THIS INDUSTRY

04:07:09.214 --> 04:07:11.449
FURTHER OUT OF THE STATE. SO

04:07:11.516 --> 04:07:12.717
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE

04:07:12.784 --> 04:07:15.253
FACTS RIGHT IN ANY OF THESE

04:07:15.320 --> 04:07:15.854
DISCUSSIONS. SO I APPRECIATE

04:07:15.921 --> 04:07:16.855
THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY A

04:07:16.922 --> 04:07:18.757
FEW OF THOSE FACTS. THANK YOU.

04:07:18.823 --> 04:07:19.624
THANK YOU. COULD I ADD ONE

04:07:19.691 --> 04:07:21.660
THING JUST TO PROVIDE A SOURCE

04:07:21.726 --> 04:07:22.928
FOR MY NUMBERS? SORRY. OH YEAH.

04:07:22.994 --> 04:07:24.496
SOURCE FOR THE NUMBERS. BUT I

04:07:24.563 --> 04:07:26.565
DON'T WANT IT TO BE A DEBATE

04:07:26.631 --> 04:07:27.632
AMONGST THE PANELISTS MEMBER

04:07:27.699 --> 04:07:29.067
DRIVEN QUESTIONS. VALUE WAS

04:07:29.134 --> 04:07:30.135
SLIGHTLY OFF. IT'S 3.2 BILLION

04:07:30.202 --> 04:07:32.137
TO 4 BILLION FROM THE SENATE

04:07:32.204 --> 04:07:32.671
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE'S

04:07:32.737 --> 04:07:34.472
ANALYSIS OF SENATOR ALLEN'S SB

04:07:34.539 --> 04:07:40.245
709 FROM 2023. THANK YOU. CHAIR

04:07:40.312 --> 04:07:43.448
COLLINS. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

04:07:43.515 --> 04:07:44.749
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE A

04:07:44.816 --> 04:07:46.484
LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT AND

04:07:46.551 --> 04:07:47.652
CLARITY FROM ALL PARTIES. SO

04:07:47.719 --> 04:07:49.588
THANK YOU SO MUCH IS EXTREMELY

04:07:49.654 --> 04:07:52.624
HELPFUL FOR ME. JUST MY MY ONLY

04:07:52.691 --> 04:07:54.693
OTHER THING WAS GOING TO

04:07:54.759 --> 04:07:59.331
TIFFANY FROM PHILLIPS 66. IT'S

04:07:59.397 --> 04:08:02.634
JUST JUST FOR FOR CLARIFICATION.

04:08:02.701 --> 04:08:05.437
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

04:08:05.503 --> 04:08:09.107
FACILITY AND IT'S IT BEING THE

04:08:09.174 --> 04:08:11.076
RENEWABLE ENERGY COMPLEX AND

04:08:11.142 --> 04:08:12.811
IT'S IN RODEO. RIGHT. OKAY. SO

04:08:12.877 --> 04:08:15.480
IT'S IN RODEO. YOU MENTIONED

04:08:15.547 --> 04:08:18.083
THAT YOU THINGS ARE HAPPENING

04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:19.551
TO WHERE YOU GUYS ARE UNDER A,

04:08:19.618 --> 04:08:20.885
A, AN ACTUAL HEADWIND. THAT'S

04:08:20.952 --> 04:08:22.654
RIGHT. AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE

04:08:22.721 --> 04:08:24.189
YOUR TIME WAS CONSTRAINED, YOU

04:08:24.256 --> 04:08:25.590
CAN REALLY ELABORATE ON THAT.

04:08:25.657 --> 04:08:27.392
CAN YOU JUST KIND OF GIVE ME A

04:08:27.459 --> 04:08:28.627
LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT OR

04:08:28.693 --> 04:08:29.694
CLARIFICATION IN REGARDS TO

04:08:29.761 --> 04:08:31.730
WHAT YOU ALL ARE FACING

04:08:31.796 --> 04:08:32.998
CURRENTLY AS YOU TALK ABOUT?

04:08:33.064 --> 04:08:34.966
ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. THANK

04:08:35.033 --> 04:08:35.867
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. SO JUST

04:08:35.934 --> 04:08:37.535
IN TERMS OF THE HEADWINDS,

04:08:37.602 --> 04:08:39.638
OBVIOUSLY THE LCFS PROGRAM HAS

04:08:39.704 --> 04:08:41.506
BEEN VERY, VERY IMPORTANT FOR

04:08:41.573 --> 04:08:44.009
US FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE. IN

04:08:44.075 --> 04:08:45.477
ADDITION, FEDERAL PROGRAMS ARE

04:08:45.543 --> 04:08:48.680
ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WAY

04:08:48.747 --> 04:08:51.483
THAT THE PROJECT WAS BUILT,

04:08:51.549 --> 04:08:54.119
IT'S REALLY BUILT TO TAKE ON

04:08:54.185 --> 04:08:56.554
THE WASTE BASED FEEDSTOCKS.

04:08:56.621 --> 04:08:58.723
THAT IS SOMETHING FROM AN

04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:59.724
ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE THAT

04:08:59.791 --> 04:09:02.761
I THINK EVERYONE CAN AGREE IS

04:09:02.827 --> 04:09:06.631
BETTER, BUT IT'S ALSO MORE

04:09:06.698 --> 04:09:09.567
COSTLY. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT

04:09:09.634 --> 04:09:12.337
INVESTMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE

04:09:12.404 --> 04:09:14.673
TO MAKE, WE HAD ASSUMED THAT

04:09:14.739 --> 04:09:16.741
THE LCFS CREDIT PRICE WOULD BE

04:09:16.808 --> 04:09:18.543
AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. WE ALSO

04:09:18.610 --> 04:09:19.911
ASSUMED THAT FEDERAL PROGRAMS

04:09:19.978 --> 04:09:21.613
WOULD BE AT A CERTAIN LEVEL.

04:09:21.680 --> 04:09:23.948
AND SO WHEN WE MADE THE

04:09:24.015 --> 04:09:25.417
DECISION BACK IN 2020 TO FUND

04:09:25.483 --> 04:09:27.719
THAT PROJECT AND THE CONVERSION,

04:09:27.786 --> 04:09:29.821
WE WERE IN A VERY DIFFERENT

04:09:29.888 --> 04:09:31.956
WORLD. AND I THINK, JUST TO BE

04:09:32.023 --> 04:09:33.725
BLUNT, IF WE WERE MAKING THAT

04:09:33.792 --> 04:09:34.626
DECISION TODAY, WE'D PROBABLY

04:09:34.693 --> 04:09:36.594
BE LOOKING AT A PLACE LIKE

04:09:36.661 --> 04:09:38.463
LOUISIANA, QUITE FRANKLY, TO TO

04:09:38.530 --> 04:09:41.966
BUILD THAT PROJECT. OBVIOUSLY,

04:09:42.033 --> 04:09:43.735
WE'VE MADE THE INVESTMENT. WE

04:09:43.802 --> 04:09:46.037
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE

04:09:46.104 --> 04:09:47.372
RENEWABLE DIESEL, VERY LOW

04:09:47.439 --> 04:09:50.041
CARBON INTENSIVE RENEWABLE

04:09:50.108 --> 04:09:52.210
DIESEL AND SUSTAINABLE AVIATION

04:09:52.277 --> 04:09:54.212
FUEL. WE'VE MADE THAT

04:09:54.279 --> 04:09:54.813
COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA, AND

04:09:54.879 --> 04:09:57.449
WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO STAY

04:09:57.515 --> 04:10:02.087
IN BUSINESS. THANK YOU. THANK

04:10:02.153 --> 04:10:03.555
YOU. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

04:10:03.621 --> 04:10:06.424
MOVING ON TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

04:10:06.491 --> 04:10:10.362
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MADAM CHAIR.

04:10:10.428 --> 04:10:12.664
LET'S SEE HERE. ALL RIGHT. SO

04:10:12.731 --> 04:10:13.898
LOT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT I KNOW

04:10:13.965 --> 04:10:15.500
IT'S GETTING LATE SO I DON'T

04:10:15.567 --> 04:10:17.669
WANT TO GO TOO DEEP INTO THIS,

04:10:17.736 --> 04:10:19.037
BUT I THINK PHOEBE, ONE

04:10:19.104 --> 04:10:20.472
QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU, YOU

04:10:20.538 --> 04:10:22.073
KNOW, YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

04:10:22.140 --> 04:10:23.408
COMMENTS THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU

04:10:23.475 --> 04:10:25.910
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT LCFS. WHAT

04:10:25.977 --> 04:10:28.913
WHAT IN YOUR MIND DO YOU SEE AS

04:10:28.980 --> 04:10:30.682
THE ALTERNATIVE TO THIS? RIGHT.

04:10:30.749 --> 04:10:31.916
SO HOW CAN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE

04:10:31.983 --> 04:10:34.552
TO LEAD, OBVIOUSLY, TO

04:10:34.619 --> 04:10:36.721
ACHIEVING ITS ENVIRONMENTAL

04:10:36.788 --> 04:10:40.458
GOALS WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM? AND

04:10:40.525 --> 04:10:40.892
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

04:10:40.959 --> 04:10:44.662
ALTERNATIVES THAT YOU SEE? WELL,

04:10:44.729 --> 04:10:45.830
SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE LCFS,

04:10:45.897 --> 04:10:48.666
I THINK OUR WHAT WE SEE AS A

04:10:48.733 --> 04:10:50.835
PROGRAM FOCUSED ON ZERO

04:10:50.902 --> 04:10:52.637
EMISSION VEHICLES, WE'RE NOT

04:10:52.704 --> 04:10:54.773
THE PROGRAM, AS I MENTIONED

04:10:54.839 --> 04:10:58.943
EARLIER, WAS DIRECTED IN 2006,

04:10:59.010 --> 04:11:01.045
STARTED IN 2009, IN A VERY

04:11:01.112 --> 04:11:03.882
DIFFERENT SITUATION IN TERMS OF

04:11:03.948 --> 04:11:05.617
WHERE WE ARE WITH OUR ZERO

04:11:05.683 --> 04:11:07.685
EMISSION VEHICLE BUILD OUT. SO

04:11:07.752 --> 04:11:09.821
WE SEE MUCH MORE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:11:09.888 --> 04:11:12.023
INVEST LCFS DOLLARS LCFS

04:11:12.090 --> 04:11:14.826
INVESTMENTS IN ZERO EMISSIONS,

04:11:14.893 --> 04:11:16.861
ESPECIALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS

04:11:16.928 --> 04:11:17.929
LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS,

04:11:17.996 --> 04:11:20.131
MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN SUPPORT

04:11:20.198 --> 04:11:21.866
THE TRANSITION. WE ON THE IN

04:11:21.933 --> 04:11:23.968
TERMS OF I THINK THIS IS MAYBE

04:11:24.035 --> 04:11:25.904
A LONGER CONVERSATION, BUT ON

04:11:25.970 --> 04:11:29.007
THE LIVESTOCK THAT MR.

04:11:29.073 --> 04:11:31.009
BOCCADORO MENTIONED, THAT 1383

04:11:31.075 --> 04:11:32.811
IDENTIFIED INCENTIVES FIRST,

04:11:32.877 --> 04:11:35.380
REGULATION SECOND, AND THAT WE

04:11:35.447 --> 04:11:36.481
HAVEN'T ACTUALLY HAD THE

04:11:36.548 --> 04:11:38.917
CONVERSATION IN CALIFORNIA AS

04:11:38.983 --> 04:11:39.851
TO HOW BEST TO REGULATE IN A

04:11:39.918 --> 04:11:41.553
COST EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT AND

04:11:41.619 --> 04:11:43.154
EQUITABLE WAY THE LIVESTOCK

04:11:43.221 --> 04:11:44.489
SECTOR. AND INSTEAD, WE'VE

04:11:44.556 --> 04:11:47.091
PUSHED ALL OF THE COSTS ONTO

04:11:47.158 --> 04:11:48.726
THE COST PAYERS AND RATEPAYERS

04:11:48.793 --> 04:11:51.062
IN THE FORM OF GRANTS. AND NOW

04:11:51.129 --> 04:11:52.630
TO DRIVERS, WHAT WE'RE SEEING

04:11:52.697 --> 04:11:53.431
HUNDREDS NOW, BILLIONS OF

04:11:53.498 --> 04:11:55.066
DOLLARS IN INCENTIVES GOING

04:11:55.133 --> 04:11:57.669
FROM CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS TO

04:11:57.735 --> 04:12:01.005
ADDRESS LIVESTOCK POLLUTION AND

04:12:01.072 --> 04:12:02.474
BY KIND OF AVOIDING WHICH WE

04:12:02.540 --> 04:12:05.143
SHOULD NOW BE KIND OF HEADLONG

04:12:05.210 --> 04:12:06.678
INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

04:12:06.744 --> 04:12:08.646
REGULATIONS THAT WOULD GENERATE

04:12:08.713 --> 04:12:09.647
THE CONVERSATION AND THE

04:12:09.714 --> 04:12:10.815
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE NEED TO

04:12:10.882 --> 04:12:12.951
HAVE ON HOW BEST TO EQUITABLY

04:12:13.017 --> 04:12:14.085
AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THOSE

04:12:14.152 --> 04:12:16.154
LIVESTOCK EMISSIONS, WHETHER

04:12:16.221 --> 04:12:17.655
IT'S BY TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM

04:12:17.722 --> 04:12:19.524
WET MANURE MANAGEMENT OR OTHER

04:12:19.591 --> 04:12:22.694
MEANS. OKAY. SO, YOU KNOW, I

04:12:22.760 --> 04:12:24.362
KNOW YOU MENTIONED RIGHT NOW

04:12:24.429 --> 04:12:25.630
AND THEN ALSO IN SOME OF YOUR

04:12:25.697 --> 04:12:27.732
EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT COST AND

04:12:27.799 --> 04:12:28.666
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY,

04:12:28.733 --> 04:12:29.767
YOUR CONCERNS FOR LOW INCOME

04:12:29.834 --> 04:12:31.569
COMMUNITIES. I THINK A BIT OF

04:12:31.636 --> 04:12:33.304
WHERE I'M STRUGGLING HERE WITH

04:12:33.371 --> 04:12:35.840
YOUR TESTIMONY IS, YOU KNOW,

04:12:35.907 --> 04:12:36.708
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME

04:12:36.774 --> 04:12:38.376
INCENTIVES BEING PASSED ALONG

04:12:38.443 --> 04:12:39.811
TO CERTAIN COMPANIES TO

04:12:39.878 --> 04:12:41.679
CONTINUE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY

04:12:41.746 --> 04:12:42.814
AND SORT OF TRYING TO REACH

04:12:42.881 --> 04:12:44.582
THESE GOALS. BUT, I MEAN,

04:12:44.649 --> 04:12:45.783
AREN'T THE COSTS REALLY BEING

04:12:45.850 --> 04:12:47.919
DRIVEN BY THE POLICIES THAT

04:12:47.986 --> 04:12:48.586
WE'VE ALREADY PASSED IN

04:12:48.653 --> 04:12:50.922
CALIFORNIA? I MEAN, IS NOT THE

04:12:50.989 --> 04:12:52.590
COST THAT ARE GOING TO BE

04:12:52.657 --> 04:12:54.626
PLACED ON THESE LOW INCOME

04:12:54.692 --> 04:12:57.061
CONSUMERS AS A RESULT OF

04:12:57.128 --> 04:12:57.829
REGULATIONS AND A RESULT OF

04:12:57.896 --> 04:12:59.631
POLICIES THAT WE, YOU KNOW, FOR

04:12:59.697 --> 04:13:00.865
GOOD INTENTIONS HAVE ALREADY

04:13:00.932 --> 04:13:02.567
PASSED. AND SO, YOU KNOW, HOW

04:13:02.634 --> 04:13:04.669
DO WE HOW DO WE SQUARE THAT

04:13:04.736 --> 04:13:06.471
WITH SORT OF, YOU KNOW, THE

04:13:06.538 --> 04:13:07.939
REALITY THAT, YOU KNOW, ALL OF

04:13:08.006 --> 04:13:09.707
THESE PRODUCERS AND THINGS THAT

04:13:09.774 --> 04:13:10.909
ARE ALSO TRYING TO KEEP THEIR

04:13:10.975 --> 04:13:12.810
COSTS DOWN, YOU KNOW, SHOULDN'T

04:13:12.877 --> 04:13:14.712
BE GETTING SOME OF THESE

04:13:14.779 --> 04:13:15.680
INCENTIVES. SURE. I'LL ANSWER

04:13:15.747 --> 04:13:17.682
THE BEST I CAN AND WELCOME

04:13:17.749 --> 04:13:19.217
OTHERS TO ANSWER AS WELL. I

04:13:19.284 --> 04:13:20.919
THINK THAT THAT WE'VE PASSED

04:13:20.985 --> 04:13:22.654
POLICIES SOME GOOD, SOME SOME

04:13:22.720 --> 04:13:23.821
GOOD FOR THEIR TIME, AND

04:13:23.888 --> 04:13:28.459
NOTHING'S INDELIBLE. YOU KNOW,

04:13:28.526 --> 04:13:31.195
STATUTES AMEND STATUTES,

04:13:31.262 --> 04:13:31.829
REGULATIONS AMEND REGULATIONS.

04:13:31.896 --> 04:13:33.498
AND IT'S TIME, I THINK, AS

04:13:33.565 --> 04:13:34.566
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LOW

04:13:34.632 --> 04:13:37.068
CARBON FUEL STANDARD, THAT WE,

04:13:37.135 --> 04:13:38.469
THE LEGISLATURE, HAS NOT

04:13:38.536 --> 04:13:40.638
EFFECTIVELY WEIGHED IN ON THE

04:13:40.705 --> 04:13:42.473
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. AND

04:13:42.540 --> 04:13:44.075
THE RECENT CHANGES EXACERBATED

04:13:44.142 --> 04:13:48.212
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW. SO IT

04:13:48.279 --> 04:13:50.415
KIND OF ONE OF, YOU KNOW,

04:13:50.481 --> 04:13:51.749
THERE'S KIND OF SOME TECHNICAL

04:13:51.816 --> 04:13:52.951
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

04:13:53.017 --> 04:13:54.619
ADDITIONALITY, ONE SIGNIFICANT

04:13:54.686 --> 04:13:55.787
CHANGE THAT THE RECENT LOW

04:13:55.853 --> 04:13:57.689
CARBON FUEL STANDARD MADE IS

04:13:57.755 --> 04:14:00.091
THAT EVEN IF THE DAIRY SECTOR

04:14:00.158 --> 04:14:02.961
IS REGULATED, THE LIVESTOCK

04:14:03.027 --> 04:14:04.629
BIOGAS PRODUCTION WILL CONTINUE

04:14:04.696 --> 04:14:06.798
TO GENERATE INCENTIVES, WHICH

04:14:06.864 --> 04:14:08.833
IS NOT TRUE FOR ANY OTHER

04:14:08.900 --> 04:14:10.635
INDUSTRY, AS FAR AS I KNOW. SO

04:14:10.702 --> 04:14:13.137
WHAT WE WHAT WE WHAT WE SEE IS

04:14:13.204 --> 04:14:14.839
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS WITH THE

04:14:14.906 --> 04:14:16.641
RECENT REGULATIONS, MORE AND

04:14:16.708 --> 04:14:18.543
MORE AND MORE KIND OF A LARGER

04:14:18.610 --> 04:14:20.678
THUMB ON THE SCALE TO PUSH

04:14:20.745 --> 04:14:22.413
MONEY FROM CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS

04:14:22.480 --> 04:14:27.418
TO THE INDUSTRIES. I THINK I'LL

04:14:27.485 --> 04:14:28.720
PASS KIND OF THE SAME. AND

04:14:28.786 --> 04:14:30.788
ANYONE CAN TAKE THIS. I MEAN,

04:14:30.855 --> 04:14:32.490
I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE

04:14:32.557 --> 04:14:33.658
WANTS TO COME BACK UP TO THE

04:14:33.725 --> 04:14:35.526
TABLE, BUT KIND OF CURIOUS FROM

04:14:35.593 --> 04:14:36.594
SOME OF THE INDUSTRY

04:14:36.661 --> 04:14:37.695
REPRESENTATIVES HERE. JUST I

04:14:37.762 --> 04:14:39.397
KNOW A LOT OF YOUR TESTIMONY

04:14:39.464 --> 04:14:40.498
WAS ALREADY FOCUSED ON THIS,

04:14:40.565 --> 04:14:42.834
BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE REALLY AS

04:14:42.900 --> 04:14:44.802
THE CONSEQUENCES OF, YOU KNOW,

04:14:44.869 --> 04:14:46.437
NOT OBVIOUSLY, I'M LOOKING HERE

04:14:46.504 --> 04:14:49.374
AT THE CDC AND CARB'S RECENT

04:14:49.440 --> 04:14:50.608
RECOMMENDATIONS ON NOT MAKING

04:14:50.675 --> 04:14:53.144
CHANGES TO LCFS, YOU KNOW,

04:14:53.211 --> 04:14:54.479
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH, YOU

04:14:54.545 --> 04:14:56.214
KNOW, ON REFINERIES, OIL

04:14:56.280 --> 04:14:57.715
PRODUCTION, THINGS LIKE THAT,

04:14:57.782 --> 04:15:00.051
BUT ALSO JUST LIKE REALLY AN

04:15:00.118 --> 04:15:01.686
EMPHASIS ON NOT MAKING ANY

04:15:01.753 --> 04:15:03.821
MAJOR CHANGES. WHAT ARE SOME OF

04:15:03.888 --> 04:15:07.091
THE CONSEQUENCES OF, YOU KNOW,

04:15:07.158 --> 04:15:08.426
MAKING MAJOR CHANGES AT THIS

04:15:08.493 --> 04:15:12.430
POINT? WELL, CAN I TAKE THAT

04:15:12.497 --> 04:15:13.631
ELECTRICITY START AND THEN

04:15:13.698 --> 04:15:14.866
ANYONE AND WE ALSO HAVE THE

04:15:14.932 --> 04:15:16.567
PUBLIC COMMENT, MIKE, IF WE IF

04:15:16.634 --> 04:15:19.037
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CHAIRS FOR

04:15:19.103 --> 04:15:19.804
PEOPLE, I THINK FROM OUR

04:15:19.871 --> 04:15:21.205
ELECTRICITY SIDE, IT'S REALLY

04:15:21.272 --> 04:15:22.740
WHAT CO CHAIR ALVAREZ WAS

04:15:22.807 --> 04:15:24.809
TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT CAITLIN

04:15:24.876 --> 04:15:26.744
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN TERMS

04:15:26.811 --> 04:15:28.613
OF WE DON'T HAVE THE POLICIES

04:15:28.680 --> 04:15:30.448
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ANYMORE.

04:15:30.515 --> 04:15:32.650
AND WE'RE IN DESPERATE NEED OF

04:15:32.717 --> 04:15:34.719
MAKING CONTINUING TO MAKE

04:15:34.786 --> 04:15:37.689
PROGRESS. AND WE NEED TO MAKE

04:15:37.755 --> 04:15:39.490
SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE

04:15:39.557 --> 04:15:41.659
MONEY TO THOSE THAT NEED IT THE

04:15:41.726 --> 04:15:43.061
MOST, SO THAT THIS TRANSITION

04:15:43.127 --> 04:15:44.862
TRANSFORMATION TO CLEANER

04:15:44.929 --> 04:15:45.697
TECHNOLOGIES, TO ZERO EMISSION

04:15:45.763 --> 04:15:48.599
IS NOT BORNE BY THOSE WHO CAN

04:15:48.666 --> 04:15:51.302
LEAST AFFORD IT. AND SO THE

04:15:51.369 --> 04:15:52.737
MONEY THAT THE UTILITIES PUT

04:15:52.804 --> 04:15:54.605
OUT AFTER THEY GET THE CREDITS,

04:15:54.672 --> 04:15:56.874
80% WILL GO TO EQUITY PROJECTS.

04:15:56.941 --> 04:15:58.676
AND SO FOR US, THE URGENCY IS

04:15:58.743 --> 04:16:00.712
JUST REALLY NEEDING TO GET THAT

04:16:00.778 --> 04:16:01.612
MONEY TO KEEP GOING OUT THE

04:16:01.679 --> 04:16:03.648
DOOR TO EQUITY PROJECTS TO MAKE

04:16:03.715 --> 04:16:05.316
SURE THAT LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS

04:16:05.383 --> 04:16:08.720
CAN BE A PART OF GETTING INTO

04:16:08.786 --> 04:16:10.388
ZEVS, BECAUSE THAT IS ANOTHER

04:16:10.455 --> 04:16:11.489
ISSUE WHERE, YOU KNOW, WE

04:16:11.556 --> 04:16:12.857
DEFINITELY SEE THAT WE NEED TO

04:16:12.924 --> 04:16:14.459
MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUPPORTED TO

04:16:14.525 --> 04:16:16.561
GET INTO THE VEHICLES AND THAT

04:16:16.627 --> 04:16:18.029
THEY'RE NOT LEFT BEHIND. AND

04:16:18.096 --> 04:16:19.397
THAT ALSO WE NEED TO REALLY DO

04:16:19.464 --> 04:16:21.599
A LOT OF WORK ON OUR MEDIUM AND

04:16:21.666 --> 04:16:23.267
HEAVY DUTY SECTOR. AND SO

04:16:23.334 --> 04:16:24.435
MAKING ANY CHANGES UPSETS THE

04:16:24.502 --> 04:16:26.604
MARKET. IT DELAYS EVEN FURTHER.

04:16:26.671 --> 04:16:27.905
AND SO I THINK FROM OUR

04:16:27.972 --> 04:16:29.507
PERSPECTIVE, YOU KNOW, WE WE

04:16:29.574 --> 04:16:30.775
REALLY WANT TO GO FORWARD. AND

04:16:30.842 --> 04:16:32.777
ALSO IT WAS TO SAM'S POINT

04:16:32.844 --> 04:16:33.377
EARLIER A FOUR YEAR

04:16:33.444 --> 04:16:34.579
DELIBERATIVE PROCESS, MANY,

04:16:34.645 --> 04:16:36.714
MANY HOURS OF TESTIMONY AND

04:16:36.781 --> 04:16:38.816
WORKSHOPS AND YEARS IN THE

04:16:38.883 --> 04:16:39.550
MAKING, VERY COMPLICATED

04:16:39.617 --> 04:16:41.819
RULEMAKING. SO I THINK THOSE

04:16:41.886 --> 04:16:43.621
ARE MAYBE SOME OF OUR. THANK

04:16:43.688 --> 04:16:45.890
YOU. JUST VERY QUICKLY, I THINK

04:16:45.957 --> 04:16:46.958
IT'S INTERESTING. WE'RE COMING

04:16:47.024 --> 04:16:48.826
UP ON THE 20 YEAR ANNIVERSARY

04:16:48.893 --> 04:16:51.496
OF AB 32 NEXT YEAR, AND THE

04:16:51.562 --> 04:16:54.732
STATE SET A PATH. THEY

04:16:54.799 --> 04:16:56.567
BASICALLY SAID, WE WANT TO MOVE

04:16:56.634 --> 04:16:58.936
DOWN A CERTAIN PATH. WE WANT TO

04:16:59.003 --> 04:17:00.905
SEND SIGNALS TO THE MARKET TO

04:17:00.972 --> 04:17:03.708
MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE

04:17:03.775 --> 04:17:04.509
TRANSITION, TO MAKE THESE

04:17:04.575 --> 04:17:06.778
INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN ENERGY. SO

04:17:06.844 --> 04:17:07.979
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

04:17:08.045 --> 04:17:10.681
POINT TO TAKE AWAY IS THAT

04:17:10.748 --> 04:17:11.783
THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE BEING

04:17:11.849 --> 04:17:13.551
MADE, AND THAT MARKET CERTAINTY

04:17:13.618 --> 04:17:15.787
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL, WHETHER

04:17:15.853 --> 04:17:16.521
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LOW

04:17:16.587 --> 04:17:18.422
CARBON FUEL STANDARD OR THE CAP

04:17:18.489 --> 04:17:20.057
AND TRADE PROGRAM. I'M GOING TO

04:17:20.124 --> 04:17:22.393
BORROW THIS TERM THAT I HEARD

04:17:22.460 --> 04:17:24.796
QUITE A FEW WEEKS AGO. BUT

04:17:24.862 --> 04:17:27.165
THESE ARE MARQUEE PROGRAMS.

04:17:27.231 --> 04:17:28.599
THESE ARE MARQUEE PROGRAMS. AND

04:17:28.666 --> 04:17:29.667
THEY'VE ABSOLUTELY SIGNALED TO

04:17:29.734 --> 04:17:31.302
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, THE

04:17:31.369 --> 04:17:32.970
REST OF THE WORLD, THAT

04:17:33.037 --> 04:17:33.805
CALIFORNIA IS TAKING A

04:17:33.871 --> 04:17:35.840
LEADERSHIP POSITION ON CLIMATE.

04:17:35.907 --> 04:17:38.376
AND SO I THINK IT'S NOW UP TO

04:17:38.442 --> 04:17:39.944
THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT,

04:17:40.011 --> 04:17:41.913
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO

04:17:41.979 --> 04:17:44.081
TURN AWAY FROM, OR DO YOU WANT

04:17:44.148 --> 04:17:45.383
TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT PATH AND

04:17:45.449 --> 04:17:47.618
ENSURE THAT YOU ARE SENDING THE

04:17:47.685 --> 04:17:49.287
CONSISTENT MARKET SIGNALS THAT

04:17:49.353 --> 04:17:51.656
WERE SENT ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO?

04:17:51.722 --> 04:17:53.858
THANK YOU. I'M ALSO GOING TO

04:17:53.925 --> 04:17:56.027
PICK UP ON A SIMILAR THEME OF

04:17:56.093 --> 04:17:57.929
INVESTMENT AND MARKET CERTAINTY.

04:17:57.995 --> 04:17:59.697
THAT'S WHAT IS AT PLAY HERE,

04:17:59.764 --> 04:18:01.766
AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT'S AT RISK.

04:18:01.833 --> 04:18:05.570
AND PRIOR TO THE LCFS

04:18:05.636 --> 04:18:08.506
RULEMAKING THAT STARTED SEVERAL

04:18:08.573 --> 04:18:11.809
YEARS AGO, THE MARKET WAS

04:18:11.876 --> 04:18:13.644
RUNNING AT A REAL CLIP. THE

04:18:13.711 --> 04:18:15.880
CREDITS WERE TRADING AT A HIGH

04:18:15.947 --> 04:18:18.549
PRICE, AND THERE WAS NOT A WEEK

04:18:18.616 --> 04:18:19.917
THAT PASSED THAT I DIDN'T GET A

04:18:19.984 --> 04:18:21.619
PHONE CALL FROM AN INVESTOR

04:18:21.686 --> 04:18:22.787
SAYING, WE'RE LOOKING TO BRING

04:18:22.854 --> 04:18:25.723
OUR PROJECT TO CALIFORNIA. WE

04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:27.425
WANT SOME HELP IN FIGURING THIS

04:18:27.491 --> 04:18:30.394
OUT. AND AS THE LCFS BROUGHT

04:18:30.461 --> 04:18:32.597
MORE AND IT WAS SUCH A

04:18:32.663 --> 04:18:33.898
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM, IT BROUGHT

04:18:33.965 --> 04:18:35.499
LOTS AND LOTS OF CREDITS IN.

04:18:35.566 --> 04:18:37.668
AND IF ANYTHING, WE NEEDED TO

04:18:37.735 --> 04:18:39.237
UPDATE THE PROGRAM TO KEEP PACE

04:18:39.303 --> 04:18:40.571
WITH THE INNOVATION AND THE

04:18:40.638 --> 04:18:43.741
INVESTMENT. AND THAT RULEMAKING

04:18:43.808 --> 04:18:45.543
WENT THROUGH. AS TIFFANY AND

04:18:45.610 --> 04:18:47.144
LARA SAID, IT WAS A LONG AND

04:18:47.211 --> 04:18:48.512
DELIBERATIVE PROCESS, AND IT

04:18:48.579 --> 04:18:50.948
WENT THROUGH THE NECESSARY

04:18:51.015 --> 04:18:52.516
PROCESS. BUT THE IMPACT OF THAT

04:18:52.583 --> 04:18:54.652
WAS CREDIT PRICES WENT LOWER

04:18:54.719 --> 04:18:56.487
AND LOWER AND LOWER. AND THEN

04:18:56.554 --> 04:18:58.556
WHAT WE SAW THIS YEAR IS THEY

04:18:58.623 --> 04:19:01.392
DIPPED TO AN ALL TIME LOW. AND

04:19:01.459 --> 04:19:02.693
NOW THAT WE HAVE THE PROGRAM

04:19:02.760 --> 04:19:05.696
BACK ON TRACK, WE'VE GOT THE

04:19:05.763 --> 04:19:06.530
RULEMAKING BACK IN PLACE. WHAT

04:19:06.597 --> 04:19:08.933
WE ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO SEE

04:19:09.000 --> 04:19:10.835
IS SLOWLY GETTING THOSE CREDIT

04:19:10.902 --> 04:19:15.373
PRICES BACK UP AS WE START TO

04:19:15.439 --> 04:19:17.642
GENERATE AS THE DEFICITS AND

04:19:17.708 --> 04:19:19.243
THE CREDITS START TO BALANCE

04:19:19.310 --> 04:19:20.511
THEMSELVES OUT A LITTLE BIT

04:19:20.578 --> 04:19:23.714
BETTER. AND I HOPE TO BE

04:19:23.781 --> 04:19:24.582
STARTING TO RECEIVE MORE OF

04:19:24.649 --> 04:19:26.717
THOSE PHONE CALLS AGAIN, ABOUT

04:19:26.784 --> 04:19:28.719
INVESTORS TRYING TO BRING THEIR

04:19:28.786 --> 04:19:29.553
PROJECTS INTO THE STATE,

04:19:29.620 --> 04:19:31.622
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

04:19:31.689 --> 04:19:34.525
IS AN OVERALL, IT'S NOT A

04:19:34.592 --> 04:19:35.693
CHILLING, BUT IT'S JUST IT'S

04:19:35.760 --> 04:19:37.561
GOT INVESTORS SORT OF HOLDING

04:19:37.628 --> 04:19:39.664
STEADY FOR THE TIME BEING. SO

04:19:39.730 --> 04:19:42.099
I'LL BUILD ON THAT. FOR THE

04:19:42.166 --> 04:19:43.668
HYDROGEN COMMUNITY. WHEN THINGS

04:19:43.734 --> 04:19:46.103
WERE AT A GOOD CLIP PRIOR TO

04:19:46.170 --> 04:19:47.571
THE UNCERTAINTIES, WE BUILT

04:19:47.638 --> 04:19:48.739
SEVEN STATIONS WITHOUT ANY

04:19:48.806 --> 04:19:50.508
PUBLIC FINANCING AT ALL, NO

04:19:50.574 --> 04:19:52.810
PUBLIC INCENTIVES. WE WERE ABLE

04:19:52.877 --> 04:19:55.479
TO DELIVER THAT BECAUSE THE THE

04:19:55.546 --> 04:19:57.748
CAPEX OR THE OPEX SIGNAL THAT

04:19:57.815 --> 04:19:59.684
THAT THE LCFS PROVIDES THROUGH

04:19:59.750 --> 04:20:02.787
THE CREDITS, AS WELL AS THE THE

04:20:02.853 --> 04:20:05.423
CREDIT VALUE AND OUR ABILITY TO

04:20:05.489 --> 04:20:06.624
DELIVER FUEL. AND AS I

04:20:06.691 --> 04:20:07.858
MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY, WE

04:20:07.925 --> 04:20:08.659
WERE DELIVERING 90% RENEWABLE

04:20:08.726 --> 04:20:09.860
FUEL WITH ZERO CARBON INTENSITY.

04:20:09.927 --> 04:20:11.762
AT THAT POINT IN TIME. THE

04:20:11.829 --> 04:20:13.064
MARKET WAS REALLY WORKING FOR

04:20:13.130 --> 04:20:14.799
US, AND THE LAST FOUR YEARS

04:20:14.865 --> 04:20:16.734
THINGS HAVE STAGNATED AND WITH

04:20:16.801 --> 04:20:18.436
THE ALL TIME LOW, WE HAVEN'T

04:20:18.502 --> 04:20:19.737
REALLY BUILT ANY NEW STATIONS.

04:20:19.804 --> 04:20:21.539
WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OPEN

04:20:21.605 --> 04:20:23.607
HANDFULS, BUT NOT AT THE SAME

04:20:23.674 --> 04:20:24.842
PACE THAT WE WERE SEEING AT

04:20:24.909 --> 04:20:26.811
THAT POINT IN TIME. AND WE HAD

04:20:26.877 --> 04:20:28.479
A LINE OF SIGHT ON, ON

04:20:28.546 --> 04:20:29.981
DISPLACING DIESEL FOR DOLLAR

04:20:30.047 --> 04:20:32.516
FOR DOLLAR, MILE FOR MILE, AND

04:20:32.583 --> 04:20:34.685
WITHOUT THE SIGNAL OF THE LCFS.

04:20:34.752 --> 04:20:35.586
WE HAVE ALMOST NO OTHER

04:20:35.653 --> 04:20:37.555
POLICIES THAT ARE GOING TO

04:20:37.621 --> 04:20:38.723
SUPPORT OUR DEPLOYMENT. SO

04:20:38.789 --> 04:20:39.924
WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM, YOU WON'T

04:20:39.991 --> 04:20:41.492
SEE THE HYDROGEN HUB COME TO

04:20:41.559 --> 04:20:42.793
FRUITION, BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT

04:20:42.860 --> 04:20:43.961
RELIES ON THE TRANSPORTATION

04:20:44.028 --> 04:20:45.830
SEGMENT TO SUPPORT THE OFFTAKE

04:20:45.896 --> 04:20:47.064
OF THE RENEWABLE MOLECULES THAT

04:20:47.131 --> 04:20:47.865
ARE GOING TO BE CREATED BY

04:20:47.932 --> 04:20:49.467
THOSE INVESTMENT PROJECTS. AND

04:20:49.533 --> 04:20:51.535
SO IT'S THIS IS REALLY A KIND

04:20:51.602 --> 04:20:53.404
OF A PIVOTAL AND A FOUNDATIONAL

04:20:53.471 --> 04:20:54.739
TOOL FOR US GETTING THESE

04:20:54.805 --> 04:20:55.773
VEHICLES INTO MARKET. BECAUSE

04:20:55.840 --> 04:20:57.742
IF I CANNOT BUILD THE STATIONS,

04:20:57.808 --> 04:21:00.177
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

04:21:00.244 --> 04:21:00.778
DELIVER THE VEHICLES THAT WE

04:21:00.845 --> 04:21:02.113
HAVE COMMERCIALLY READY FROM

04:21:02.179 --> 04:21:04.615
MAJOR MANUFACTURERS TODAY. YEAH.

04:21:04.682 --> 04:21:06.584
THANK YOU. I KNOW WE'RE NOT

04:21:06.650 --> 04:21:08.419
GIVING COMMENTS. I WON'T REALLY

04:21:08.486 --> 04:21:10.554
SAY A WHOLE LOT MORE, BUT I DID

04:21:10.621 --> 04:21:11.789
PROBABLY GOING TO END MY

04:21:11.856 --> 04:21:12.656
QUESTIONS THERE. BUT I THINK,

04:21:12.723 --> 04:21:13.891
YOU KNOW, WE CAN PROVIDE

04:21:13.958 --> 04:21:15.793
COMMENTS. OKAY. JUST ONE OF THE

04:21:15.860 --> 04:21:17.128
THINGS I NEED TO FURTHER THINK

04:21:17.194 --> 04:21:18.796
ABOUT. AND I THINK FOR EVERYONE

04:21:18.863 --> 04:21:19.830
IN THIS ROOM, NOT JUST THE

04:21:19.897 --> 04:21:21.499
INDUSTRY FOLKS, BUT I THINK

04:21:21.565 --> 04:21:22.900
EVEN THE POLICY MAKERS AND

04:21:22.967 --> 04:21:24.769
EVERYONE ELSE, YOU KNOW, I DO

04:21:24.835 --> 04:21:26.837
REMAIN CONCERNED, OBVIOUSLY,

04:21:26.904 --> 04:21:28.773
ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS HAS ON

04:21:28.839 --> 04:21:30.975
DRIVERS AS WELL. RIGHT. AND OUR

04:21:31.042 --> 04:21:32.543
CONSTITUENTS AND I DO

04:21:32.610 --> 04:21:35.413
UNDERSTAND THAT. I KNOW SOME OF

04:21:35.479 --> 04:21:36.547
THE PRESENTATIONS WERE GIVEN

04:21:36.614 --> 04:21:38.649
TODAY THAT THIS IS A VERY SMALL

04:21:38.716 --> 04:21:39.850
PERCENTAGE OR PORTION OF, YOU

04:21:39.917 --> 04:21:41.619
KNOW, THE GAS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

04:21:41.685 --> 04:21:42.520
PRICES THAT WE PAY IN

04:21:42.586 --> 04:21:44.789
CALIFORNIA. BUT I AM

04:21:44.855 --> 04:21:46.057
CONTINUOUSLY CONCERNED AND SORT

04:21:46.123 --> 04:21:47.792
OF MONITORING ALL OF THAT

04:21:47.858 --> 04:21:49.527
BECAUSE I THINK LAYER AFTER

04:21:49.593 --> 04:21:51.695
LAYER AFTER LAYER IN CALIFORNIA

04:21:51.762 --> 04:21:54.498
HAS BEEN ADDED ON TO COSTS FOR

04:21:54.565 --> 04:21:56.367
OUR CONSTITUENTS. FOR AS MY

04:21:56.434 --> 04:21:57.435
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO

04:21:57.501 --> 04:21:58.736
POINTED OUT, WHO ARE DRIVING

04:21:58.803 --> 04:21:59.970
CARS THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY

04:22:00.037 --> 04:22:01.405
GOING TO BE DRIVING FOR FOR

04:22:01.472 --> 04:22:04.008
MUCH LONGER, AND THEY'RE, YOU

04:22:04.075 --> 04:22:05.042
KNOW, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

04:22:05.109 --> 04:22:06.177
NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO

04:22:06.243 --> 04:22:08.112
TRANSITION TO A ZERO EMISSION

04:22:08.179 --> 04:22:09.380
VEHICLE ANYTIME SOON. AND SO

04:22:09.447 --> 04:22:10.781
JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO KEEP

04:22:10.848 --> 04:22:12.983
THAT TOP OF MIND AS WE MOVE

04:22:13.050 --> 04:22:13.984
FORWARD WITH THIS DISCUSSION.

04:22:14.051 --> 04:22:15.019
BUT, MADAM CHAIR, I APPRECIATE

04:22:15.086 --> 04:22:16.520
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TODAY.

04:22:16.587 --> 04:22:18.789
THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND I'M JUST

04:22:18.856 --> 04:22:20.858
GOING TO ASK A FEW FOLLOW UP

04:22:20.925 --> 04:22:22.726
QUESTIONS OF JUST THE

04:22:22.793 --> 04:22:25.496
CONVERSATION THAT I HEARD AND

04:22:25.563 --> 04:22:27.765
WILL RESERVE. THIS IS A REALLY

04:22:27.832 --> 04:22:29.467
A PUBLIC RECORD. IT ALLOWS FOR

04:22:29.533 --> 04:22:30.568
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO

04:22:30.634 --> 04:22:33.304
FOLLOW UP ON AND TO, AS WE HAVE

04:22:33.370 --> 04:22:33.804
THIS CONVERSATION AROUND

04:22:33.871 --> 04:22:34.538
AFFORDABILITY AND CFS AND

04:22:34.605 --> 04:22:35.806
EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE TALKING

04:22:35.873 --> 04:22:38.142
ABOUT NOW, WE HAVE MEMBERS WHO

04:22:38.209 --> 04:22:38.609
CAN REFER BACK TO THIS

04:22:38.676 --> 04:22:41.412
RECORDING. AND SO I HATE THAT

04:22:41.479 --> 04:22:42.012
SOME OF MY QUESTIONS ARE GOING

04:22:42.079 --> 04:22:43.981
TO BE OFFLINE, BUT OH WELL,

04:22:44.048 --> 04:22:45.683
THEY'LL HAVE TO COME FIND ME TO

04:22:45.749 --> 04:22:47.518
ASK ME WHAT I ASK AND WHY. BUT

04:22:47.585 --> 04:22:48.752
I DO WANT TO GET IN THIS

04:22:48.819 --> 04:22:50.020
CONVERSATION AROUND THE DAIRY

04:22:50.087 --> 04:22:51.489
DIGESTERS JUST BECAUSE IT'S

04:22:51.555 --> 04:22:52.623
SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD

04:22:52.690 --> 04:22:53.591
COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT.

04:22:53.657 --> 04:22:54.892
EVERYBODY JUMPS UP AND PHOEBE'S

04:22:54.959 --> 04:22:56.894
REPLACING THEM, AND SAM IS

04:22:56.961 --> 04:23:01.866
COMING UP AND AND EVERYBODY'S

04:23:01.932 --> 04:23:02.766
BEEN JUST WONDERFUL IN THIS

04:23:02.833 --> 04:23:03.934
PRESENTATION. I'VE APPRECIATED

04:23:04.001 --> 04:23:05.536
THE FOLLOW UP FROM MY

04:23:05.603 --> 04:23:06.704
COLLEAGUES AND HOW THAT AND

04:23:06.770 --> 04:23:08.472
WHAT THEY'VE SAID. SO THIS IS

04:23:08.539 --> 04:23:10.541
REALLY I'M GOING TO FOLLOW UP

04:23:10.608 --> 04:23:12.610
ON WHAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

04:23:12.676 --> 04:23:15.212
WERE. BUT ONE THING I HAD JUST

04:23:15.279 --> 04:23:18.382
FROM THE PRESENTATION WAS FOR

04:23:18.449 --> 04:23:20.818
PHOEBE AROUND, YOU TALKED ABOUT

04:23:20.885 --> 04:23:22.887
LIQUID MANURE AND THAT ISSUE.

04:23:22.953 --> 04:23:26.457
AND SO WHERE WOULD IT GO IF WE

04:23:26.524 --> 04:23:28.792
DIDN'T HAVE THIS? WHERE WOULD

04:23:28.859 --> 04:23:33.898
THAT GO? I WILL NOT ANSWER YOUR

04:23:33.964 --> 04:23:35.499
QUESTION WITH A QUESTION, AND

04:23:35.566 --> 04:23:37.701
YOU CAN IF YOU NEED TO CLARIFY,

04:23:37.768 --> 04:23:39.003
YOU NEED ME TO CLARIFY. THAT'S

04:23:39.069 --> 04:23:40.704
FINE. THERE'S THERE ARE THERE

04:23:40.771 --> 04:23:43.240
ARE OTHER WAYS TO MANAGE MANURE.

04:23:43.307 --> 04:23:44.642
THIS IS A RELATIVELY RECENT.

04:23:44.708 --> 04:23:46.377
PHENOMENON IN CALIFORNIA TO

04:23:46.443 --> 04:23:47.978
HAVE THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF

04:23:48.045 --> 04:23:50.748
DAIRY COWS IN ONE PLACE THAT

04:23:50.814 --> 04:23:53.617
KIND OF ASSOCIATED WITH THE

04:23:53.684 --> 04:23:55.286
ACCUMULATION AND LIQUIFICATION

04:23:55.352 --> 04:23:57.555
OF MANURE. AND YOU'LL

04:23:57.621 --> 04:23:58.422
DEFINITELY HEAR DIFFERENT

04:23:58.489 --> 04:24:01.158
THINGS FROM AND PART OF THAT IS

04:24:01.225 --> 04:24:01.692
CONSOLIDATION, RIGHT. LIKE

04:24:01.759 --> 04:24:02.927
THEY'RE THEY WERE MORE SPREAD

04:24:02.993 --> 04:24:04.728
OUT. THERE WERE MORE DAIRY

04:24:04.795 --> 04:24:05.930
FARMERS LESS CONSOLIDATED. SO

04:24:05.996 --> 04:24:07.031
YOU'RE HAVING YOU'RE HAVING

04:24:07.097 --> 04:24:08.832
THEM IN BIGGER PLACES. I MEAN,

04:24:08.899 --> 04:24:09.767
BIG MOVE TO THE SAN JOAQUIN

04:24:09.833 --> 04:24:12.203
VALLEY IN THE 90S. AND SO YOU

04:24:12.269 --> 04:24:13.771
YOU HAVE CONSOLIDATION. AND

04:24:13.837 --> 04:24:16.106
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN THERE WAS

04:24:16.173 --> 04:24:18.542
WE KNEW AT THE TIME, OR MAYBE

04:24:18.609 --> 04:24:20.678
NOT PERSONALLY, BUT WE KNEW AS

04:24:20.744 --> 04:24:22.513
AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS KNEW THAT

04:24:22.580 --> 04:24:26.150
WE WERE GOING TO LIQUEFY MANURE

04:24:26.217 --> 04:24:28.886
AND CONCENTRATE ALL OF THESE

04:24:28.953 --> 04:24:30.654
COWS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE

04:24:30.721 --> 04:24:33.958
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE, WE WE KNEW

04:24:34.024 --> 04:24:35.292
WE WERE WRITING A BAD CHECK AT

04:24:35.359 --> 04:24:37.628
THAT TIME. OKAY. SO SO THEN YOU

04:24:37.695 --> 04:24:39.697
WOULD SAY THAT JUST THE LIVE SO,

04:24:39.763 --> 04:24:42.933
SO POLICIES MADE AT LOCAL LEVEL

04:24:43.000 --> 04:24:44.969
POLICIES, I MEAN IT IMPACTS OF

04:24:45.035 --> 04:24:47.571
THE MARKET WHICH CAUSED

04:24:47.638 --> 04:24:48.505
CONSOLIDATION, RIGHT. AND

04:24:48.572 --> 04:24:50.474
POLICIES AND POLICIES THAT

04:24:50.541 --> 04:24:51.809
ALLOWED IT, THAT ALLOWED IT AND

04:24:51.875 --> 04:24:53.677
THEN AND THEN AND THEN THOSE

04:24:53.744 --> 04:24:56.647
POLICIES THAT ALLOWED THE

04:24:56.714 --> 04:24:57.948
CONCENTRATION, NOT NECESSARILY

04:24:58.015 --> 04:25:00.484
THE CONSOLIDATION, BUT ALLOWED

04:25:00.551 --> 04:25:01.752
CONCENTRATION, CREATED

04:25:01.819 --> 04:25:04.855
LIVESTOCK POLLUTION, WHICH

04:25:04.922 --> 04:25:06.190
RESULTS IN LIQUID MANURE. IS

04:25:06.257 --> 04:25:07.591
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? AND I

04:25:07.658 --> 04:25:09.693
WOULD SAY THAT AND I WOULD SAY

04:25:09.760 --> 04:25:12.062
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO MANAGE

04:25:12.129 --> 04:25:12.663
MANURE, AND THERE ARE PLUSES

04:25:12.730 --> 04:25:14.732
AND MINUSES TO SEVERAL. DRY

04:25:14.798 --> 04:25:15.899
MANURE MANAGEMENT DOES NOT

04:25:15.966 --> 04:25:18.269
CREATE METHANE. SO LIQUEFIED

04:25:18.335 --> 04:25:19.803
MANURE MANAGEMENT IS ACTUALLY

04:25:19.870 --> 04:25:20.871
WHAT CREATES THE VAST, VAST

04:25:20.938 --> 04:25:22.673
AMOUNT OF METHANE. SO YOU HAVE

04:25:22.740 --> 04:25:24.475
A DRY MANURE MANAGEMENT KIND OF

04:25:24.541 --> 04:25:26.610
SCRAPE SYSTEMS ETC. NO, WE

04:25:26.677 --> 04:25:28.712
DON'T HAVE ANY METHANE. WE HAVE

04:25:28.779 --> 04:25:29.880
VERY LITTLE METHANE TO MITIGATE

04:25:29.947 --> 04:25:30.714
BECAUSE METHANE HAS NEVER BEEN

04:25:30.781 --> 04:25:32.983
CREATED. SO WHAT WE HAVE WITH

04:25:33.050 --> 04:25:33.684
LIQUID MANURE MANAGEMENT IS

04:25:33.751 --> 04:25:34.418
INTENTIONALLY, FOR BUSINESS

04:25:34.485 --> 04:25:36.654
REASONS, CREATED METHANE, WHICH

04:25:36.720 --> 04:25:38.589
WE NOW ARE IN A POSITION TO

04:25:38.656 --> 04:25:39.757
HAVE TO PAY, HOWEVER, BILLIONS

04:25:39.823 --> 04:25:41.525
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO

04:25:41.592 --> 04:25:44.995
MITIGATE THE WHAT WE A COUPLE A

04:25:45.062 --> 04:25:47.364
COUPLE ISSUES THAT I'D SAY IS

04:25:47.431 --> 04:25:49.600
WE NEVER WE HAVEN'T BECAUSE WE

04:25:49.667 --> 04:25:50.768
HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THIS HEAD ON.

04:25:50.834 --> 04:25:53.237
WHAT IS THE BEST AND HIGHEST

04:25:53.304 --> 04:25:54.605
AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF

04:25:54.672 --> 04:25:57.107
MANAGING THIS PROBLEM, OF

04:25:57.174 --> 04:25:57.675
MANAGING WHICH PROBLEM? THE

04:25:57.741 --> 04:25:58.776
PROBLEM OF WET MANURE

04:25:58.842 --> 04:25:59.877
MANAGEMENT. WET MANURE

04:25:59.943 --> 04:26:01.412
MANAGEMENT. SO YOU'RE SAYING

04:26:01.478 --> 04:26:02.780
THAT THERE YOU CAN HAVE DRY

04:26:02.846 --> 04:26:05.316
MANURE MANAGEMENT BUT DOESN'T

04:26:05.382 --> 04:26:06.583
PRODUCE METHANE AND THAT IT'S

04:26:06.650 --> 04:26:08.986
WET MANURE MANAGEMENT THAT IS

04:26:09.053 --> 04:26:11.055
PRODUCING THIS METHANE. AND NOW

04:26:11.121 --> 04:26:12.956
THAT THIS METHANE IS PRODUCED,

04:26:13.023 --> 04:26:15.659
WHAT IS YOUR PROPOSAL. GO BACK

04:26:15.726 --> 04:26:17.728
TO DRY MANURE MANAGEMENT. IS

04:26:17.795 --> 04:26:18.495
THAT WHAT YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR?

04:26:18.562 --> 04:26:20.631
I WOULD SAY THAT DRY MANURE

04:26:20.698 --> 04:26:23.267
MANAGEMENT IS A MORE IS A

04:26:23.334 --> 04:26:25.602
BETTER ENVIRONMENTALLY SUPERIOR

04:26:25.669 --> 04:26:28.505
WAY OF MANAGING MANURE. WHAT

04:26:28.572 --> 04:26:30.674
RECENT RESEARCH CAME OUT SAYING

04:26:30.741 --> 04:26:32.876
ONE OF THE WE KEEP ON PILING ON

04:26:32.943 --> 04:26:34.978
POLICIES THAT CONTINUE TO

04:26:35.045 --> 04:26:36.747
PROVIDE A PREFERENCE FOR

04:26:36.814 --> 04:26:38.048
LIQUEFIED MANURE MANAGEMENT,

04:26:38.115 --> 04:26:39.917
ONE OF THEM BEING THE LOW

04:26:39.983 --> 04:26:40.784
CARBON FUEL STANDARD, BECAUSE

04:26:40.851 --> 04:26:42.619
YOU HAVE THIS NOW MAJOR PROFIT

04:26:42.686 --> 04:26:46.156
MOTIVE TO CREATE AND AND

04:26:46.223 --> 04:26:48.592
MAINTAIN LIQUEFIED MANURE

04:26:48.659 --> 04:26:49.493
MANAGEMENT BECAUSE INSTEAD OF

04:26:49.560 --> 04:26:51.428
SWITCHING TO DRY MANURE OKAY.

04:26:51.495 --> 04:26:54.131
SO SO I JUST WANT TO BECAUSE

04:26:54.198 --> 04:26:54.865
WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT LCFS.

04:26:54.932 --> 04:26:56.700
SO I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO ALL

04:26:56.767 --> 04:26:58.769
THE REST. BUT I JUST WANTED TO

04:26:58.836 --> 04:26:59.903
UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC TRAIN THAT

04:26:59.970 --> 04:27:01.472
THAT GETS US HERE FOR YOU. IS

04:27:01.538 --> 04:27:03.941
THAT BECAUSE OF POLICY, BECAUSE

04:27:04.007 --> 04:27:06.310
OF MARKET CONDITIONS, BECAUSE

04:27:06.377 --> 04:27:07.478
OF POLICIES? IN CALIFORNIA, WE

04:27:07.544 --> 04:27:09.847
HAVE THIS CONSOLIDATION OF

04:27:09.913 --> 04:27:11.615
DAIRY FARMERS, OF DAIRY FARMS.

04:27:11.682 --> 04:27:13.384
AND THOSE ARE PRIMARILY IN THE

04:27:13.450 --> 04:27:14.718
CENTRAL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY,

04:27:14.785 --> 04:27:16.987
WHICH THE LCFS IS CONTRIBUTING

04:27:17.054 --> 04:27:18.522
TO. BUT I'M NOT THERE YET. I'M

04:27:18.589 --> 04:27:20.591
JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IT,

04:27:20.657 --> 04:27:21.825
GET LOGICALLY TO WHERE YOU ARE.

04:27:21.892 --> 04:27:23.460
SO BECAUSE OF THAT, WE ARE WE

04:27:23.527 --> 04:27:26.330
WE HAVE THIS, WE HAVE THIS.

04:27:26.397 --> 04:27:29.900
CONCENTRATION THE THE BECAUSE

04:27:29.967 --> 04:27:31.535
OF THAT, THEY THERE IS A CHOICE

04:27:31.602 --> 04:27:35.439
TO THEN CHOOSE LIQUID MANURE

04:27:35.506 --> 04:27:38.609
OVER DRY MANURE MANAGEMENT.

04:27:38.675 --> 04:27:41.545
BECAUSE YOUR LOGIC IS BECAUSE

04:27:41.612 --> 04:27:44.715
THERE IS NOW A PROGRAM THAT

04:27:44.782 --> 04:27:45.516
ALLOWS THAT CONVERSION OF

04:27:45.582 --> 04:27:48.719
LIQUID MANURE TO, TO A PRODUCT

04:27:48.786 --> 04:27:51.855
THAT ALLOWS THAT GETS CREDITS.

04:27:51.922 --> 04:27:54.158
SO THEN I CAN GET PAID TO DO

04:27:54.224 --> 04:27:57.094
LIQUID MANURE MANAGEMENT OVER

04:27:57.161 --> 04:27:57.728
DRY MANURE MANAGEMENT. IS THAT

04:27:57.795 --> 04:27:59.596
WHAT YOU'RE ALMOST SAYING? I

04:27:59.663 --> 04:28:01.632
WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS. MY

04:28:01.698 --> 04:28:03.801
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WAS

04:28:03.867 --> 04:28:05.202
CHEAPER TO DO LIQUID MANURE

04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:07.371
MANAGEMENT. SO LIKE WHEN WHEN

04:28:07.438 --> 04:28:09.573
THE CHEAPER FORGET LCFS DOES

04:28:09.640 --> 04:28:10.841
CHEAPER IN GENERAL. SO IT WAS

04:28:10.908 --> 04:28:12.476
CHEAPER. I HAVE A LOT. I'M

04:28:12.543 --> 04:28:13.644
TRYING TO REDUCE COSTS. I'M A

04:28:13.710 --> 04:28:14.912
FARMER, ONE LESS COST. I'M

04:28:14.978 --> 04:28:16.413
GOING TO DO LIQUID MANAGEMENT

04:28:16.480 --> 04:28:17.848
OVER DRY DRY GOVERNMENT. STATE

04:28:17.915 --> 04:28:20.284
GOVERNMENT ARE LETTING ME DO

04:28:20.350 --> 04:28:20.818
THIS. I'M GOING TO GO, I'M

04:28:20.884 --> 04:28:22.586
GOING TO DO THIS. AND THEN THE

04:28:22.653 --> 04:28:24.421
ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE SO HIGH.

04:28:24.488 --> 04:28:25.456
RIGHT. BUT IT WAS CHEAPER ON

04:28:25.522 --> 04:28:27.024
THE BENEFIT OF THE PERSON WHO

04:28:27.090 --> 04:28:28.792
IS DOING IT. CORRECT. AND THEN

04:28:28.859 --> 04:28:31.929
ON TOP OF THAT LATER CAME THIS

04:28:31.995 --> 04:28:34.798
THIS BENEFIT WHERE NOT ONLY IS

04:28:34.865 --> 04:28:36.667
IT CHEAPER FOR ME TO DO IT COST

04:28:36.733 --> 04:28:38.402
MORE, COST EFFECTIVE ACTUALLY

04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:40.504
CAN ACTUALLY TURN IT INTO A

04:28:40.571 --> 04:28:42.406
PROFIT, CORRECT? OKAY. AND

04:28:42.473 --> 04:28:43.941
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. YES. OKAY.

04:28:44.007 --> 04:28:45.709
WHAT THIS RESEARCH I THINK A

04:28:45.776 --> 04:28:47.411
COUPLE PEOPLE HAVE RAISED THIS

04:28:47.478 --> 04:28:49.546
IS NOW NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THIS

04:28:49.613 --> 04:28:50.647
PROFIT MOTIVE AROUND LIQUEFIED

04:28:50.714 --> 04:28:54.084
MANURE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE A

04:28:54.151 --> 04:28:55.118
DISINCENTIVE TO INNOVATE

04:28:55.185 --> 04:28:57.221
ELSEWHERE, TO INNOVATE TO MORE

04:28:57.287 --> 04:28:58.956
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MANURE

04:28:59.022 --> 04:28:59.823
MANAGEMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL

04:28:59.890 --> 04:29:02.493
OF THIS MONEY, OKAY. SO YOU CAN

04:29:02.559 --> 04:29:03.994
DO SOMETHING THAT'S IN YOUR

04:29:04.061 --> 04:29:06.029
MIND, LESS ENVIRONMENTALLY

04:29:06.096 --> 04:29:07.965
IMPACTFUL, BUT YOU WON'T

04:29:08.031 --> 04:29:09.466
BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT THE

04:29:09.533 --> 04:29:11.802
CHEAPEST WAY, IT ALSO HAS A

04:29:11.869 --> 04:29:12.836
PROFIT WAY. IS THAT THAT'S YOUR

04:29:12.903 --> 04:29:14.371
ARGUMENT. OKAY. I JUST WANT TO

04:29:14.438 --> 04:29:15.472
MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR

04:29:15.539 --> 04:29:17.641
ARGUMENT. AND WE'VE SEEN LESS

04:29:17.708 --> 04:29:19.643
DAIRY COWS IN CALIFORNIA. SO

04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:23.280
THERE'S NOT THE I MEAN AND DATA

04:29:23.347 --> 04:29:23.981
HAS SHOWN THAT LIKE THERE'S

04:29:24.047 --> 04:29:25.682
LIKE I DON'T KNOW, YOU'D HAVE

04:29:25.749 --> 04:29:27.417
TO REALLY GIVE ME CITE A PLACE

04:29:27.484 --> 04:29:28.986
THAT HAS SAID THAT THERE ARE

04:29:29.052 --> 04:29:31.355
MORE DAIRY COWS THAN THERE WERE

04:29:31.421 --> 04:29:33.457
SOME TIME AGO. SO SO THERE IS

04:29:33.524 --> 04:29:35.192
LESS DAIRY COWS THAN THERE WAS

04:29:35.259 --> 04:29:37.594
BEFORE. SO. SO THERE MIGHT BE

04:29:37.661 --> 04:29:39.963
SOME INCENTIVE TO KEEP DOING A

04:29:40.030 --> 04:29:40.898
LOW COST EFFECTIVE METHOD THAT

04:29:40.964 --> 04:29:42.633
ALSO GIVES YOU MONEY, BUT IT'S

04:29:42.699 --> 04:29:45.202
NOT GENERATING MORE COWS. AND

04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:47.037
SO THEN NOW HEARING THAT

04:29:47.104 --> 04:29:49.306
ARGUMENT, BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

04:29:49.373 --> 04:29:50.574
ABOUT LCFS AND THE FACT THAT

04:29:50.641 --> 04:29:52.576
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS

04:29:52.643 --> 04:29:54.545
CREDIT WISE, I TURN TO MICHAEL

04:29:54.611 --> 04:29:56.847
AND SAM, HEARING THAT ARGUMENT

04:29:56.914 --> 04:29:59.383
OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRY

04:29:59.449 --> 04:30:01.552
AND LIQUID AND IT BEING ADVISED

04:30:01.618 --> 04:30:03.720
BY. SO JUST FOR THE RECORD,

04:30:03.787 --> 04:30:04.955
BECAUSE I THINK WHEN PEOPLE

04:30:05.022 --> 04:30:05.689
WATCH THE EXCHANGE BACK AND

04:30:05.756 --> 04:30:06.857
FORTH, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

04:30:06.924 --> 04:30:09.159
THESE QUESTIONS. SO I'M TRYING

04:30:09.226 --> 04:30:10.594
TO PLAY THE PUBLIC HERE AND

04:30:10.661 --> 04:30:11.828
MEMBERS OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF

04:30:11.895 --> 04:30:12.963
THE LEGISLATURE. CAN I SAY

04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.730
SOMETHING REAL QUICK, CHAIR

04:30:13.797 --> 04:30:15.799
REALLY QUICKLY. OKAY. WE DON'T

04:30:15.866 --> 04:30:16.967
WE'RE NOT SEEING AN INCREASE IN

04:30:17.034 --> 04:30:17.701
COWS. WE'RE SEEING, AS

04:30:17.768 --> 04:30:18.936
EVERYBODY MENTIONED, A DECREASE

04:30:19.002 --> 04:30:21.138
IN COWS. THAT IS HAPPENING

04:30:21.204 --> 04:30:21.939
PRIMARILY AT THE SMALL DAIRIES

04:30:22.005 --> 04:30:24.141
THAT SMALL DAIRIES ARE CLOSING.

04:30:24.207 --> 04:30:26.009
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THAT THE

04:30:26.076 --> 04:30:27.044
LARGE DAIRIES ARE GETTING

04:30:27.110 --> 04:30:30.380
LARGER. YEAH, BUT BUT THE TOTAL

04:30:30.447 --> 04:30:32.049
I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

04:30:32.115 --> 04:30:34.184
BECAUSE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE OF

04:30:34.251 --> 04:30:35.819
CONSOLIDATION. SO WHICH LCFS IS

04:30:35.886 --> 04:30:38.655
CONTRIBUTING TO? I WILL LEAVE

04:30:38.722 --> 04:30:39.723
THAT THERE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT

04:30:39.790 --> 04:30:41.491
HAVE TO DO WITH I DON'T THINK

04:30:41.558 --> 04:30:42.726
THAT'S RELATED TO LCFS, BUT I

04:30:42.793 --> 04:30:44.761
WANT TO GIVE IT TO THE OTHER

04:30:44.828 --> 04:30:46.530
MEMBERS OF THE PANEL TO ADDRESS

04:30:46.597 --> 04:30:48.498
THIS SO WE CAN CLOSE THE LOOP

04:30:48.565 --> 04:30:50.601
ON IT AND GET TO PUBLIC. OTHER

04:30:50.667 --> 04:30:52.836
COMMENTS AND SHARE JUST A

04:30:52.903 --> 04:30:54.404
LITTLE REALITY WHEN IT COMES TO

04:30:54.471 --> 04:30:55.706
HOW DAIRIES MANAGE WASTE. AND

04:30:55.772 --> 04:30:59.209
YES, IT'S TRUE THAT WHAT MANURE

04:30:59.276 --> 04:31:01.712
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE ON THE

04:31:01.778 --> 04:31:03.680
NEWER, MORE MODERN DAIRIES THAT

04:31:03.747 --> 04:31:06.016
HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THE SAN

04:31:06.083 --> 04:31:06.650
JOAQUIN VALLEY, WE SHOULDN'T BE

04:31:06.717 --> 04:31:08.685
SURPRISED BY IT. WE MANAGE

04:31:08.752 --> 04:31:11.154
MANURE ON DAIRY FARMS, MUCH

04:31:11.221 --> 04:31:12.422
LIKE WE MANAGE MANURE IN OUR

04:31:12.489 --> 04:31:15.392
HOMES. WE FLUSH IT. IT'S A VERY

04:31:15.459 --> 04:31:17.628
EFFICIENT WAY AND A VERY

04:31:17.694 --> 04:31:20.330
HEALTHFUL WAY FOR THE COWS TO

04:31:20.397 --> 04:31:21.598
MANAGE MANURE. WE DO HAVE DRY

04:31:21.665 --> 04:31:24.067
SCRAPE SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA,

04:31:24.134 --> 04:31:25.102
AND WE HAVE INCENTIVES THROUGH

04:31:25.168 --> 04:31:26.870
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

04:31:26.937 --> 04:31:27.871
FOOD AND AG TO CONVERT MORE

04:31:27.938 --> 04:31:30.641
FARMS TO DRY SCRAPE. NOT EVERY

04:31:30.707 --> 04:31:32.776
FARM IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR

04:31:32.843 --> 04:31:34.578
DRY SCRAPE. WHAT LAGOONS

04:31:34.645 --> 04:31:36.647
PROVIDE IN EVERY DAIRY HAS TO

04:31:36.713 --> 04:31:37.781
HAVE A LAGOON, EVEN IF IT

04:31:37.848 --> 04:31:38.749
DOESN'T HAVE A WET MANAGEMENT

04:31:38.815 --> 04:31:40.550
SYSTEM, BECAUSE THE WATER BOARD

04:31:40.617 --> 04:31:41.752
REQUIRES US TO BE ABLE TO

04:31:41.818 --> 04:31:43.387
MANAGE STORMWATER AND RUNOFF ON

04:31:43.453 --> 04:31:44.655
OUR FARMS IN CALIFORNIA, NOT

04:31:44.721 --> 04:31:46.690
ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE IN THE

04:31:46.757 --> 04:31:47.991
STATE. SO THERE'S ALWAYS GOING

04:31:48.058 --> 04:31:49.626
TO BE SOME LIQUID MANURE. BUT

04:31:49.693 --> 04:31:52.462
WHAT WHAT LAGOONS PROVIDE IS A

04:31:52.529 --> 04:31:54.131
WAY FOR US TO STORE THE

04:31:54.197 --> 04:31:55.699
NUTRIENTS THAT WE CAN THEN

04:31:55.766 --> 04:31:57.034
APPLY TO OUR CROPS. THEY ALLOW

04:31:57.100 --> 04:31:59.036
US TO BECOME BETTER FARMERS,

04:31:59.102 --> 04:32:00.837
AND IT ALLOWS US TO PUT THE

04:32:00.904 --> 04:32:02.839
NUTRIENTS ON THE CROPS WHEN THE

04:32:02.906 --> 04:32:04.374
CROPS ACTUALLY NEED THEM, NOT

04:32:04.441 --> 04:32:06.576
SIMPLY WHEN WE HAVE EXCESS

04:32:06.643 --> 04:32:09.780
MANURE AT OUR DAIRY. AND THAT'S

04:32:09.846 --> 04:32:10.514
WHAT WAS OCCURRING FOR A LONG

04:32:10.580 --> 04:32:12.849
PERIOD OF TIME. BUT WE DO HAVE

04:32:12.916 --> 04:32:14.718
CONVERSIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING.

04:32:14.785 --> 04:32:15.585
MOST DAIRIES CAN'T CONVERT TO

04:32:15.652 --> 04:32:17.688
FULL SCRAPE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

04:32:17.754 --> 04:32:19.456
MANAGE ALL OF THEIR MANURE ON

04:32:19.523 --> 04:32:21.725
THEIR FARMS, AS DRY MANURE CAN

04:32:21.792 --> 04:32:23.660
ONLY DO THAT PRE-PLANT YOU

04:32:23.727 --> 04:32:25.762
CAN'T COME AND APPLY DRY MANURE

04:32:25.829 --> 04:32:27.831
TO A CORN CROP, WHICH IS WHAT

04:32:27.898 --> 04:32:29.533
WE GROW PRIMARILY ON OUR DAIRY

04:32:29.599 --> 04:32:30.801
FARMS AFTER THE CROP HAS BEEN

04:32:30.867 --> 04:32:32.402
PLANTED, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

04:32:32.469 --> 04:32:33.670
DISK IT IN AND YOU WOULD BE

04:32:33.737 --> 04:32:35.672
DISKING DISKING UP YOUR CROP.

04:32:35.739 --> 04:32:36.640
SO HAVING SOME COMBINATION OF

04:32:36.707 --> 04:32:38.775
WET MANURE AND DRY MANURE ON

04:32:38.842 --> 04:32:40.844
EVERY DAIRY IS A GOOD THING.

04:32:40.911 --> 04:32:41.545
AND EVEN THE ONES WITH

04:32:41.611 --> 04:32:43.647
DIGESTERS, THE FIRST THING WE

04:32:43.714 --> 04:32:45.582
DO WITH A NEW DIGESTER PROJECT

04:32:45.649 --> 04:32:48.018
IN CALIFORNIA IS WE INSTALL

04:32:48.085 --> 04:32:49.686
WHAT'S CALLED A SOLID SEPARATOR.

04:32:49.753 --> 04:32:51.922
WE SEPARATE OUT MOST OF THE

04:32:51.988 --> 04:32:54.491
COARSE SOLIDS AND USE THAT AS A

04:32:54.558 --> 04:32:57.027
DRY MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,

04:32:57.094 --> 04:32:59.463
30, 40, OR EVEN AS MUCH AS 50%.

04:32:59.529 --> 04:33:01.598
WE STILL GET CREDIT FOR THAT

04:33:01.665 --> 04:33:02.733
UNDER THE LCFS PROGRAM. THAT'S

04:33:02.799 --> 04:33:03.633
BRILLIANT. ONE OF THE OTHER

04:33:03.700 --> 04:33:06.036
THINGS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

04:33:06.103 --> 04:33:06.837
WE UNDERSTAND IS THE LCFS

04:33:06.903 --> 04:33:08.071
PROGRAM DOES NOT ENCOURAGE

04:33:08.138 --> 04:33:09.873
DAIRIES TO CONVERT FROM DRY,

04:33:09.940 --> 04:33:12.008
SCRAPE TO WET MANURE MANAGEMENT

04:33:12.075 --> 04:33:13.477
SYSTEMS, BECAUSE YOU DO NOT GET

04:33:13.543 --> 04:33:15.912
CREDIT FOR THAT UNDER THE LCFS.

04:33:15.979 --> 04:33:18.215
YOUR BASELINE IS THE DAIRY AS

04:33:18.281 --> 04:33:21.017
IT EXISTS, NOT AS YOU CHANGE IT

04:33:21.084 --> 04:33:21.852
IN THE FUTURE. SO WE'RE NOT

04:33:21.918 --> 04:33:22.853
INCENTING INCENTIVIZING DAIRIES

04:33:22.919 --> 04:33:25.789
TO GO FROM DRY, SCRAPE OR OTHER

04:33:25.856 --> 04:33:28.592
DRY MANURE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

04:33:28.658 --> 04:33:30.427
TO WET. SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A

04:33:30.494 --> 04:33:32.529
CONCERN THAT THE LEGISLATURE OR

04:33:32.596 --> 04:33:33.830
CARB OR OTHERS HAVE. BUT, YOU

04:33:33.897 --> 04:33:37.567
KNOW, WE'RE MANAGING MANURE IN

04:33:37.634 --> 04:33:38.835
DIFFERENT WAYS ON DAIRY FARMS.

04:33:38.902 --> 04:33:40.504
BUT ALMOST EVERY DAIRY THAT I'M

04:33:40.570 --> 04:33:41.905
AWARE OF HAS SOME COMBINATION

04:33:41.972 --> 04:33:43.840
OF DRY AND WET MANURE

04:33:43.907 --> 04:33:45.509
MANAGEMENT, DEPENDING UPON THE

04:33:45.575 --> 04:33:47.577
NEEDS OF THEIR FARMING

04:33:47.644 --> 04:33:49.613
PRACTICES. WET MANURE IS GREAT

04:33:49.679 --> 04:33:51.548
BECAUSE WE CAN MOVE THE

04:33:51.615 --> 04:33:53.316
NUTRIENTS OUT IN OUR IRRIGATION

04:33:53.383 --> 04:33:54.518
SYSTEMS, AND SO THAT TENDS TO

04:33:54.584 --> 04:33:56.486
BE USED ON THE THE THE CORN

04:33:56.553 --> 04:33:58.421
CROPS THAT ARE NEAREST TO THE

04:33:58.488 --> 04:33:59.823
DAIRY FOOTPRINT. AND DRY MANURE

04:33:59.890 --> 04:34:01.825
ALLOWS US TO MOVE OUR NUTRIENTS,

04:34:01.892 --> 04:34:03.660
OUR MANURE, TO THE CROPS THAT

04:34:03.727 --> 04:34:05.862
MIGHT BE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE

04:34:05.929 --> 04:34:07.464
WHERE THEY'RE DEPOSITED, WHERE

04:34:07.531 --> 04:34:09.566
THE MANURE IS DEPOSITED. SO WE

04:34:09.633 --> 04:34:12.335
NEED BOTH AND WE HAVE BOTH. AND

04:34:12.402 --> 04:34:12.803
WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT

04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:14.671
INCENTIVIZE BOTH TYPES OF

04:34:14.738 --> 04:34:16.773
SYSTEM AS A WAY TO MANAGE

04:34:16.840 --> 04:34:18.575
MANURE METHANE IN CALIFORNIA.

04:34:18.642 --> 04:34:20.410
SAM, DID YOU WANT TO ADD

04:34:20.477 --> 04:34:21.945
ANYTHING TO THAT? YEAH, JUST A

04:34:22.012 --> 04:34:24.181
FEW THINGS. I MEAN, I THINK

04:34:24.247 --> 04:34:24.781
THAT CARB AND EVEN PROFESSOR

04:34:24.848 --> 04:34:26.783
SMITH, WHO WAS HERE EARLIER AND,

04:34:26.850 --> 04:34:28.752
YOU KNOW, IS A SKEPTIC OF

04:34:28.819 --> 04:34:30.520
CERTAIN TYPES OF BIOFUELS,

04:34:30.587 --> 04:34:31.121
THEY'VE LOOKED AT THE RATE OF

04:34:31.188 --> 04:34:32.622
CONSOLIDATION AT DAIRIES WITH

04:34:32.689 --> 04:34:33.857
DIGESTERS AND THOSE WITHOUT,

04:34:33.924 --> 04:34:35.525
AND THEY'VE NOT FOUND ANY

04:34:35.592 --> 04:34:36.560
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

04:34:36.626 --> 04:34:38.395
THE TWO. SO I THINK IT'S VERY

04:34:38.461 --> 04:34:40.430
UNTRUE TO SAY THAT THE LCFS IS

04:34:40.497 --> 04:34:42.732
DRIVING CONSOLIDATION. AND SO I

04:34:42.799 --> 04:34:43.934
FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO BE VERY

04:34:44.000 --> 04:34:45.569
UPFRONT ABOUT THAT. AND THEN

04:34:45.635 --> 04:34:47.204
THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS

04:34:47.270 --> 04:34:48.505
THAT ONCE YOU DO HAVE THE

04:34:48.572 --> 04:34:49.773
LAGOON COVERING IT, CAPTURING

04:34:49.840 --> 04:34:51.708
THE METHANE AND USING IT AS A

04:34:51.775 --> 04:34:52.475
RESOURCE IS SOMETHING THE EPA

04:34:52.542 --> 04:34:54.978
HAS SUPPORTED FOR MORE THAN 25

04:34:55.045 --> 04:34:57.447
YEARS. AND STATUTORILY, YOUR

04:34:57.514 --> 04:34:58.615
COLLEAGUES DIRECTED CARB TO

04:34:58.682 --> 04:35:00.650
INCLUDE IT IN THE LCFS

04:35:00.717 --> 04:35:02.586
INCENTIVE BILL 1383. SO I THINK

04:35:02.652 --> 04:35:05.021
IT IS A GOOD STRATEGY. IT'S

04:35:05.088 --> 04:35:05.622
SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

04:35:05.689 --> 04:35:06.723
EMBRACED. IT TOOK MULTIPLE

04:35:06.790 --> 04:35:08.825
YEARS TO GET TO THIS POINT. IS

04:35:08.892 --> 04:35:10.026
IT THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR

04:35:10.093 --> 04:35:11.761
EVERY FARM? NO, BUT FOR THE

04:35:11.828 --> 04:35:13.630
FARMS THAT ALREADY HAVE LIQUID

04:35:13.697 --> 04:35:14.497
HANDLING AND ARE NEAR A GAS

04:35:14.564 --> 04:35:16.833
LINE, IT'S IT'S A HELPFUL THING

04:35:16.900 --> 04:35:19.135
TO BE ABLE TO DO. AND THEN ONE

04:35:19.202 --> 04:35:21.204
LAST QUESTION. FOLLOW UP IS IN

04:35:21.271 --> 04:35:22.739
TALKING ABOUT I LOOK AND YOU

04:35:22.806 --> 04:35:24.674
KNOW, THE PALM OIL BEING NOW

04:35:24.741 --> 04:35:26.676
DIRTY OIL AND SOYBEAN. THE

04:35:26.743 --> 04:35:27.911
CONVERSION OF I THINK IT WAS

04:35:27.978 --> 04:35:29.713
WAS IT SOY. WAS IT INDONESIA.

04:35:29.779 --> 04:35:31.181
WHICH ONE WAS INDONESIA WHERE

04:35:31.248 --> 04:35:31.915
THE CONVERSION FROM 2014 TO

04:35:31.982 --> 04:35:33.583
THERE, WHERE HOW THE CARBON

04:35:33.650 --> 04:35:35.552
INTENSITY DIDN'T MATCH THE

04:35:35.619 --> 04:35:38.855
BENEFITS. AND SO LOOKING AT

04:35:38.922 --> 04:35:40.523
YOUR PROGRAM, I THINK THAT WHAT

04:35:40.590 --> 04:35:43.526
I HEAR THE ACCUSATION IS OR THE,

04:35:43.593 --> 04:35:45.362
THE ARGUMENT IS I WON'T CALL IT

04:35:45.428 --> 04:35:47.430
ACCUSATION ARGUMENT IS THAT THE

04:35:47.497 --> 04:35:49.699
BENEFITS AREN'T THERE. IT'S

04:35:49.766 --> 04:35:50.867
SIMILAR TO THAT WHERE YOU'RE

04:35:50.934 --> 04:35:52.569
LOSING OUT. AND SO WHAT WOULD

04:35:52.636 --> 04:35:53.904
YOU SAY TO THAT QUESTION? YEAH,

04:35:53.970 --> 04:35:55.639
I WOULD SAY THAT WITH BIOFUELS

04:35:55.705 --> 04:35:57.774
YOU CAN'T IGNORE THE IMPACT OF

04:35:57.841 --> 04:35:59.976
OTHER SECTORS, AGRICULTURE AND

04:36:00.043 --> 04:36:01.678
FORESTRY AND ENERGY ARE ALL

04:36:01.745 --> 04:36:04.447
TIED TOGETHER. AND SO JUST AS

04:36:04.514 --> 04:36:05.782
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE OPPONENTS

04:36:05.849 --> 04:36:07.751
OF BIOFUELS WOULD WANT TO SAY,

04:36:07.817 --> 04:36:08.752
YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT INDIRECT

04:36:08.818 --> 04:36:10.720
LAND USE CHANGE WHEN YOU GIVE

04:36:10.787 --> 04:36:11.788
CREDIT FOR CERTAIN BIOFUELS AND

04:36:11.855 --> 04:36:13.356
KIND OF GIVE THEM LESS BECAUSE

04:36:13.423 --> 04:36:14.691
OF THAT EFFECT. I THINK FOR THE

04:36:14.758 --> 04:36:15.992
METHANE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED

04:36:16.059 --> 04:36:17.794
WITH USING WASTE IN THE RIGHT

04:36:17.861 --> 04:36:19.562
WAY ALSO NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED

04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:20.830
IN THESE SYSTEMS TO GET THE

04:36:20.897 --> 04:36:22.465
CORRECT INCENTIVES. ALL RIGHT.

04:36:22.532 --> 04:36:24.567
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

04:36:24.634 --> 04:36:26.436
THANK YOU ALL. ALL RIGHT. WE

04:36:26.503 --> 04:36:30.006
ARE GOING TO MOVE TO PUBLIC

04:36:30.073 --> 04:36:31.675
COMMENTS. AND AND THEN I'LL

04:36:31.741 --> 04:36:35.245
CLOSE US OUT AND TO OUR PUBLIC

04:36:35.312 --> 04:36:37.681
COMMENTS. WE WILL GIVE YOU A

04:36:37.747 --> 04:36:40.417
MINUTE. BUT I WOULD ASK THAT

04:36:40.483 --> 04:36:41.651
YOU IF YOU CAN DO IT SHORTER

04:36:41.718 --> 04:36:45.422
THAN A MINUTE, PLEASE DO. GOOD

04:36:45.488 --> 04:36:48.792
AFTERNOON. IS THIS ON? OKAY.

04:36:48.858 --> 04:36:50.560
GOOD AFTERNOON. JULIA LEVIN

04:36:50.627 --> 04:36:51.928
WITH THE BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION

04:36:51.995 --> 04:36:53.863
OF CALIFORNIA. WE STRONGLY

04:36:53.930 --> 04:36:55.532
SUPPORT THE LOW CARBON FUEL

04:36:55.598 --> 04:36:56.866
STANDARD AND BELIEVE THAT IT

04:36:56.933 --> 04:36:58.501
PROVIDES VERY LARGE BENEFITS TO

04:36:58.568 --> 04:37:00.103
CALIFORNIA THAT FAR OUTWEIGH

04:37:00.170 --> 04:37:01.771
THE COSTS. THOSE BENEFITS ARE

04:37:01.838 --> 04:37:03.039
THE GREATEST. HOWEVER, WHEN

04:37:03.106 --> 04:37:04.708
FUELS ARE PRODUCED IN STATE,

04:37:04.774 --> 04:37:06.710
ESPECIALLY FROM ORGANIC WASTE,

04:37:06.776 --> 04:37:07.711
YOU CAN MITIGATE WILDFIRES.

04:37:07.777 --> 04:37:09.679
WHEN YOU USE FOREST WASTE, YOU

04:37:09.746 --> 04:37:11.281
CAN REDUCE OPEN BURNING OF

04:37:11.348 --> 04:37:12.682
FORESTS AND WASTE. YOU CAN

04:37:12.749 --> 04:37:13.750
REDUCE POLLUTION FROM DAIRIES

04:37:13.817 --> 04:37:15.852
AND FROM LANDFILLS. THE SECOND

04:37:15.919 --> 04:37:17.754
ROUND OF BENEFITS ARE WHEN YOU

04:37:17.821 --> 04:37:19.689
GET FUELS THAT ARE DELIVERED TO

04:37:19.756 --> 04:37:20.890
CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE THAT IS THE

04:37:20.957 --> 04:37:22.792
ONLY WAY THAT YOU REDUCE FOSSIL

04:37:22.859 --> 04:37:24.828
FUEL USE IN CALIFORNIA. FUELS

04:37:24.894 --> 04:37:26.096
THAT AREN'T EVER EVEN DELIVERED

04:37:26.162 --> 04:37:27.564
TO CALIFORNIA, AREN'T REDUCING

04:37:27.630 --> 04:37:29.899
FOSSIL FUELS IN STATE, AND THEY

04:37:29.966 --> 04:37:31.634
END UP BEING AN END RUN AROUND

04:37:31.701 --> 04:37:32.769
CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL AND

04:37:32.836 --> 04:37:33.570
LABOR LAWS. THAT'S WHY

04:37:33.636 --> 04:37:35.605
OUT-OF-STATE FUELS ARE CHEAPER.

04:37:35.672 --> 04:37:36.906
THAT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. WE

04:37:36.973 --> 04:37:38.808
SHOULD DO WHAT WE'VE DONE UNDER

04:37:38.875 --> 04:37:40.543
THE RPS, WHERE THE LEGISLATURE,

04:37:40.610 --> 04:37:42.612
BEGINNING IN 2007, REQUIRED THE

04:37:42.679 --> 04:37:43.680
PARTICIPATING ELECTRICITY BE

04:37:43.747 --> 04:37:45.115
DELIVERED TO THE WESTERN

04:37:45.181 --> 04:37:46.816
ELECTRIC GRID, WE SHOULD PHASE

04:37:46.883 --> 04:37:48.885
IN SIMILAR DELIVERY

04:37:48.952 --> 04:37:50.987
REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE LCFS AS

04:37:51.054 --> 04:37:56.426

PIONEERS IN ORGANIC WASTE

04:38:22.752 --> 04:38:23.887
DIVERSION. AND WE TAKE THAT

04:38:23.953 --> 04:38:25.722
ORGANIC WASTE. AND INSTEAD OF

04:38:27.757 --> 04:38:28.491
LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS, WE

04:38:28.558 --> 04:38:31.661
CREATE RNG. AND WE'VE INVESTED

04:38:31.728 --> 04:38:33.530
AROUND 200 MILLION INTO AN

ANAEROBIC DIGESTER AS WELL AS

04:38:35.698 --> 04:38:36.900
THE FLEET AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO

04:38:36.966 --> 04:38:38.835
MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND WE'RE THE

WHICH CREATED A BUNCH OF JOBS

04:38:47.010 --> 04:38:49.979
IN OPERATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION.

04:38:50.046 --> 04:38:53.650
THAT WHOLE INVESTMENT, IT WAS

04:38:53.716 --> 04:38:55.385
VERY EXPENSIVE. AND TO PREVENT

04:38:55.452 --> 04:38:57.687
THAT COST BEING PASSED ON TO

04:38:57.754 --> 04:38:59.956
RATEPAYERS, WHICH IS EVERYONE,

04:39:00.023 --> 04:39:01.658
WE NEED THE LCFS TO MAKE THIS

04:39:01.724 --> 04:39:03.827
WHOLE THING WORK. IT IS KIND OF

04:39:03.893 --> 04:39:04.561
THE BASIS FOR THIS ENTIRE

04:39:04.627 --> 04:39:06.896
SYSTEM. WE ARE REQUIRED TO

04:39:06.963 --> 04:39:08.565
DIVERT ORGANICS UNDER 1383, AND

04:39:08.631 --> 04:39:10.633
THIS IS WHAT MAKES THAT KIND OF

04:39:10.700 --> 04:39:12.702
INNOVATION POSSIBLE. SO WE URGE

04:39:12.769 --> 04:39:15.472
A CONTINUATION OF THIS SYSTEM.

04:39:15.538 --> 04:39:20.577

THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AS

04:39:58.047 --> 04:39:59.549
A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO

04:39:59.616 --> 04:40:00.150
GENERATING PRIVATE INVESTMENT

04:40:00.216 --> 04:40:01.584

ARE MOVING TO ZERO EMISSION

04:40:05.922 --> 04:40:07.390
TECHNOLOGIES. CALIFORNIA MUST

04:40:07.457 --> 04:40:08.591
CONTINUE TO LEAVE OR RISK

04:40:08.658 --> 04:40:09.692
FALLING BEHIND. WE URGE THE

04:40:09.759 --> 04:40:10.894
LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT THE LCFS

04:40:10.960 --> 04:40:12.662
SO THAT OUR STATE CAN CONTINUE

04:40:12.729 --> 04:40:13.696
TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL,

04:40:13.763 --> 04:40:15.131
ACCELERATE ZERO EMISSION

GOOD AFTERNOON. MAYBE EVENING

04:40:26.509 --> 04:40:27.710

SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THE

04:40:32.615 --> 04:40:33.816
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD, WHICH

04:40:33.883 --> 04:40:34.717
HAS HELPED CALIFORNIA

04:40:34.784 --> 04:40:36.519
TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

04:40:36.586 --> 04:40:37.854
CSC IS THE PROGRAM

04:40:37.921 --> 04:40:40.557
ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE SGA, PGA,

04:40:40.623 --> 04:40:41.958
AND SOCAL EDISON PREVIOUSLY

04:40:42.025 --> 04:40:44.827
OWNED VEHICLE PROGRAMS. I CAN

04:40:44.894 --> 04:40:45.662
PROUDLY REPORT THAT THESE

04:40:45.728 --> 04:40:46.829
PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE FUNDED BY

04:40:46.896 --> 04:40:48.698
LCFS, HAVE LED TO NEARLY 52,000

04:40:48.765 --> 04:40:50.633
PREVIOUSLY OWNED VEHICLE SALES.

04:40:50.700 --> 04:40:52.835
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT LCFS HAS

04:40:52.902 --> 04:40:54.571
HELPED SPUR A GROWING, USED EV

04:40:54.637 --> 04:40:55.805
INDUSTRY IN THE STATE THAT

04:40:55.872 --> 04:40:57.040
REALLY DIDN'T EXIST A DECADE

04:40:57.106 --> 04:40:59.542
AGO. THIS HELPS WITH THE

04:40:59.609 --> 04:41:00.777
AFFORDABILITY AND GETS TO A LOT

04:41:00.843 --> 04:41:02.078
OF THE FAMILIES THAT COULDN'T

04:41:02.145 --> 04:41:03.613
AFFORD A ELECTRIC VEHICLE

04:41:03.680 --> 04:41:04.847
BEFORE THAT. FURTHERMORE, WE'VE

04:41:04.914 --> 04:41:07.150
WORKED WITH PGE ON THEIR

04:41:07.217 --> 04:41:07.850
RESIDENTIAL CHARGING SOLUTIONS

04:41:07.917 --> 04:41:09.652
AND THE SOCAL EDISON CHARGE

04:41:09.719 --> 04:41:10.620
READY HOMES PROGRAMS, WHICH

04:41:10.687 --> 04:41:14.424
HAVE DELIVERED MORE THAN 1300

04:41:14.490 --> 04:41:15.725
HOME PANEL UPGRADES AND

04:41:15.792 --> 04:41:18.695
CHARGING SYSTEMS OVER TIME. AND

04:41:18.761 --> 04:41:19.596
AS WE KNOW, HOME CHARGING IS

04:41:19.662 --> 04:41:21.164
THE PRIMARY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE

04:41:21.231 --> 04:41:22.365
CHARGE THEIR VEHICLES. THESE

04:41:22.432 --> 04:41:23.600
ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MANY

04:41:23.666 --> 04:41:25.535
BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE LOW

04:41:25.602 --> 04:41:26.803
CARBON FUEL STANDARD, AND WE

04:41:26.869 --> 04:41:29.172
SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU.

04:41:29.239 --> 04:41:30.740
CHAIR. JUST WANT TO THANK YOU

04:41:30.807 --> 04:41:32.375

04:41:32.442 --> 04:41:33.576
GREAT WORK ON THIS ISSUE. ON

BEHALF OF THE PORT OF LA AND EV

04:41:35.812 --> 04:41:37.880
REALTY, PORT OF LA IS

04:41:37.947 --> 04:41:39.882
CONVERTING TO ZERO EMISSION

04:41:39.949 --> 04:41:41.417
TRUCKS BY 2035. SO LCFS IS

04:41:41.484 --> 04:41:43.987
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THAT

04:41:44.053 --> 04:41:45.688
TO HAPPEN. ON THE COMMERCIAL

04:41:45.755 --> 04:41:47.657
CHARGING SIDE. REALTY. MANY

04:41:47.724 --> 04:41:48.758
OTHER COMMERCIAL CHARGING

04:41:48.825 --> 04:41:49.826
COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY

04:41:49.893 --> 04:41:50.493
HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA NOW.

04:41:50.560 --> 04:41:52.562
AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAM,

04:41:52.629 --> 04:41:53.930
LCFS IS THE FLAGSHIP PROGRAM

04:41:53.997 --> 04:41:56.666
THAT ALLOWS THESE COMMERCIAL

04:41:56.733 --> 04:41:58.668
FLEETS TO CONVERT FROM DIESEL

04:41:58.735 --> 04:42:00.436
TO ELECTRIC. THE PRICE POINT

04:42:00.503 --> 04:42:01.804
OVER THE LIFETIME IS ACTUALLY

04:42:01.871 --> 04:42:03.439
CHEAPER NOW BY TRANSITIONING,

04:42:03.506 --> 04:42:04.607
AND SO THEY'RE ABLE TO BUILD

04:42:04.674 --> 04:42:06.643
THESE CHARGING DEPOTS AND HELP

04:42:06.709 --> 04:42:07.744
THESE COMPANIES CONVERT TO ZERO

04:42:07.810 --> 04:42:08.945
EMISSION VEHICLES AS A RESULT

04:42:09.012 --> 04:42:10.613
OF LCFS. SO APPRECIATE YOUR

04:42:10.680 --> 04:42:11.781
CONTINUED INTEREST IN THIS AND

04:42:11.848 --> 04:42:13.616
JUST HIGH LEVEL. IT'S BRINGING

04:42:13.683 --> 04:42:14.717
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

04:42:14.784 --> 04:42:16.653
INVESTMENT INTO THIS STATE.

04:42:16.719 --> 04:42:17.387
IT'S BRINGING COMPANIES INTO

04:42:17.453 --> 04:42:18.721
THE STATE AND JOB CREATION. AND

04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:20.723
ALSO WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS,

04:42:20.790 --> 04:42:21.557
IT'S ALLOWING A LOT MORE

04:42:21.624 --> 04:42:23.760
FUNDING TO GO TO DISADVANTAGED

04:42:23.826 --> 04:42:25.528
COMMUNITIES. SO WE THINK IT'S A

04:42:25.595 --> 04:42:26.029
WELL BALANCED PROGRAM. I

04:42:26.095 --> 04:42:27.463

AIR DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES

04:42:44.781 --> 04:42:47.784
WHO ALL USE HYDROGEN. THEY ALSO

04:42:47.850 --> 04:42:49.452
ARE COUNTING ON LCFS AS A

04:42:49.519 --> 04:42:50.653
PERFORMANCE BASED, TECHNOLOGY

04:42:50.720 --> 04:42:52.955
NEUTRAL REGULATION THAT'S

04:42:53.022 --> 04:42:53.556
INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING DOWN

04:42:53.623 --> 04:42:56.125
THE COST AND CARBON INTENSITY

04:42:56.192 --> 04:42:57.393
OF THE FUELS. THIS IS

04:42:57.460 --> 04:42:58.661
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE

04:42:58.728 --> 04:43:00.263
FACE OF DIMINISHING FEDERAL

04:43:00.330 --> 04:43:02.432
SUPPORT. CARB ALREADY SPENT

04:43:02.498 --> 04:43:04.500
OVER FOUR YEARS UPDATING THE

04:43:04.567 --> 04:43:07.270
MOST RECENT LCFS, CONSIDERING

04:43:07.337 --> 04:43:08.805
HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND

FUEL PROVIDERS RELY ON THESE

04:43:16.979 --> 04:43:20.083
MARKET SIGNALS THAT ARE SENT BY

04:43:20.149 --> 04:43:20.683
THE DECLINING CARBON INTENSITY

04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:22.919
STANDARD OF THE LCFS TO

04:43:22.985 --> 04:43:23.686
INCENTIVIZE FUEL PRODUCERS AND

04:43:23.753 --> 04:43:24.987
TO MAKE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS

04:43:25.054 --> 04:43:28.458
IN CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU

04:43:28.524 --> 04:43:32.695
VERY MUCH. GOOD, GOOD EARLY

04:43:32.762 --> 04:43:34.464

AMERICAN SOYBEAN ASSOCIATION

04:43:38.434 --> 04:43:40.870
AND OUR 26 STATE AFFILIATES

04:43:40.937 --> 04:43:42.538
REPRESENTING 30 STATES, SOYBEAN

04:43:42.605 --> 04:43:44.674

04:43:44.741 --> 04:43:45.942
FARMERS IN THE U.S. APPRECIATE

04:43:46.008 --> 04:43:47.510
THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT.

04:43:47.577 --> 04:43:48.745
CALIFORNIA, AS EVERYONE KNOWS,

04:43:48.811 --> 04:43:50.813
WE LEAD ON CLIMATE. CROP BASED

04:43:50.880 --> 04:43:52.415
BIOFUELS ARE CENTRAL TO THAT

04:43:52.482 --> 04:43:53.683
SUCCESS. LET'S STICK TO THE

04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:56.319
FACTS HERE, AND NO SPECULATION.

04:43:56.386 --> 04:43:58.554
IN 2024, NEARLY 75% OF

04:43:58.621 --> 04:44:00.390
CALIFORNIA'S DIESEL SUPPLY CAME

04:44:00.456 --> 04:44:01.657
FROM BIOMASS BASED DIESEL

04:44:01.724 --> 04:44:03.593
FEEDSTOCKS SUCH AS SOY AND

04:44:03.659 --> 04:44:04.827
CANOLA OIL. WHEN COMPARED TO

04:44:04.894 --> 04:44:06.863
FOSSIL DIESEL, BIOMASS BASED

04:44:06.929 --> 04:44:08.598
DIESEL CUTS EMISSIONS 57% ON

04:44:08.664 --> 04:44:10.533
AVERAGE, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY,

04:44:10.600 --> 04:44:11.634
OVER 16 MILLION TONS OF

04:44:11.701 --> 04:44:13.703
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WERE

04:44:13.770 --> 04:44:14.570
AVOIDED LAST YEAR, WHILE

04:44:14.637 --> 04:44:17.607
PROVIDING OVER HALF OF THE LCFS

04:44:17.673 --> 04:44:18.908
CREDITS, WITH MORE THAN 90% OF

04:44:18.975 --> 04:44:19.776
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES STILL

04:44:19.842 --> 04:44:22.278
RUNNING ON DIESEL, BIODIESEL

04:44:22.345 --> 04:44:22.879
REMAINS THE MOST VIABLE

04:44:22.945 --> 04:44:24.981
SCALABLE, LOW CARBON DROP IN

04:44:25.047 --> 04:44:25.882
SOLUTION TODAY, ALSO SAVING

04:44:25.948 --> 04:44:27.550
DRIVERS UP TO $0.25 A GALLON OR

04:44:27.617 --> 04:44:29.685
MORE ON AVERAGE. HOWEVER, NEW

04:44:29.752 --> 04:44:31.654
LCFS AMENDMENTS AND CARB

04:44:31.721 --> 04:44:33.356
REGULATION RISK REVERSING

04:44:33.423 --> 04:44:35.625
PROGRESS. A 20% CAP ON SOY,

04:44:35.691 --> 04:44:37.627
CANOLA AND SUNFLOWER OILS WOULD

04:44:37.693 --> 04:44:39.595
CUT 800 MILLION GALLONS OF

04:44:39.662 --> 04:44:41.664
CLEAN FUEL, INCREASE POLLUTION

04:44:41.731 --> 04:44:43.666
ON FOSSIL DIESEL, AND RAISE

04:44:43.733 --> 04:44:45.735
PRICES AT THE PUMP. SO WE

04:44:45.802 --> 04:44:46.269
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE YOUR

04:44:46.335 --> 04:44:47.537
EFFORTS TO WORK TOWARDS

04:44:47.603 --> 04:44:49.305
REVERSING THIS. THANK YOU,

04:44:49.372 --> 04:44:51.474
THANK YOU. OKAY, COOL. THE TIME

04:44:51.541 --> 04:44:53.676
IS UP. MY NAME IS DAVID ALMEIDA.

04:44:53.743 --> 04:44:54.477
I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CLEAN

04:44:54.544 --> 04:44:55.678
ENERGY TRANSPORTATION AT PGA. I

04:44:55.745 --> 04:44:57.647
JUST WANTED TO FULLY SUPPORT

04:44:57.713 --> 04:44:58.448
THE COMMENTS FROM KELLY FROM

04:44:58.514 --> 04:45:01.117
LARA. I WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE

04:45:01.184 --> 04:45:01.751
BIT MORE OF THE UTILITY'S

04:45:01.818 --> 04:45:03.352
PERSPECTIVE. EVS ARE A CRITICAL

04:45:03.419 --> 04:45:04.887
MECHANISM FOR US TO PROVIDE

04:45:04.954 --> 04:45:07.356
DOWNWARD PRESSURE, REDUCING

04:45:07.423 --> 04:45:08.391
RATES FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. IN

04:45:08.458 --> 04:45:09.692
2024, WE SAW THAT EVS PROVIDED

04:45:09.759 --> 04:45:11.661
ABOUT A 2% REDUCTION IN RATES

04:45:11.727 --> 04:45:14.864
FOR ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS. LCFS

04:45:14.931 --> 04:45:16.199
IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO

04:45:16.265 --> 04:45:17.467
FUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND

04:45:17.533 --> 04:45:19.502
FUNDING THE PROGRAMS THAT WE

04:45:19.569 --> 04:45:20.903
HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS.

04:45:20.970 --> 04:45:22.538
TO DATE, WE'VE HAD ABOUT $350

04:45:22.605 --> 04:45:24.774
MILLION SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS

04:45:24.841 --> 04:45:26.008
WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY.

04:45:26.075 --> 04:45:27.610
JUST PUT IN PERSPECTIVE, THIS

04:45:27.677 --> 04:45:28.945
YEAR ALONE, WE'VE INCENTIVIZED

04:45:29.011 --> 04:45:30.813
ABOUT 8000 USED EVS THAT HAVE

04:45:30.880 --> 04:45:32.548
ALREADY GONE TO LOW INCOME

04:45:32.615 --> 04:45:34.350
COMMUNITIES. SO WE ENCOURAGE

04:45:34.417 --> 04:45:35.718
THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU'VE HAD

04:45:35.785 --> 04:45:37.253
REALLY SUPPORT THIS POLICY

04:45:37.320 --> 04:45:39.355
MOVING FORWARD. AND THANKS FOR

CONVERSATION TODAY. OUR COMPANY

04:45:46.863 --> 04:45:48.698

04:45:48.764 --> 04:45:49.165
WE'RE HEADQUARTERED IN

04:45:49.232 --> 04:45:50.800
CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE OVER 250

04:45:50.867 --> 04:45:52.935
FUELING STATIONS IN IN THE

04:45:53.002 --> 04:45:54.770
STATE THAT DISPLACES DIESEL.

04:45:54.837 --> 04:45:56.506
AND WE ARE THE NATION'S LARGEST

04:45:56.572 --> 04:45:58.074
PROVIDER OF RENEWABLE NATURAL

04:45:58.140 --> 04:45:59.475
GAS, TRANSPORTATION FUEL. AND I

04:45:59.542 --> 04:46:00.743
THINK WE HEARD TODAY FROM MOST

04:46:00.810 --> 04:46:03.079
OF THE PANELISTS THAT THE LCFS

04:46:03.145 --> 04:46:06.682
IS A SUCCESS. AND WE JOINED THE

04:46:06.749 --> 04:46:08.384
OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS IN

04:46:08.451 --> 04:46:10.586
BROAD SUPPORT OF THE LCFS. AND

04:46:10.653 --> 04:46:12.788
JUST A WORD OF CAUTION AS THIS

04:46:12.855 --> 04:46:14.824
MAY MOVE FORWARD, YOU KNOW, WE

04:46:14.891 --> 04:46:15.892
JUST URGE NOT TO DO ANY HARM.

04:46:15.958 --> 04:46:17.860
YOU KNOW, MARKET CERTAINTY,

04:46:17.927 --> 04:46:18.661
INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, EMISSION

04:46:18.728 --> 04:46:19.829
REDUCTIONS ARE ALL VERY, VERY

04:46:19.896 --> 04:46:21.464
IMPORTANT. AND THEY'RE AT RISK

04:46:21.531 --> 04:46:23.533
WITH ANYTHING THAT MIGHT OCCUR,

04:46:23.599 --> 04:46:24.667
MAYBE LEGISLATIVELY OR MAYBE

04:46:24.734 --> 04:46:25.735
EVEN OPENING THE RULEMAKING AT

04:46:25.801 --> 04:46:27.737
CARB. SO AGAIN, WE SUPPORT THE

04:46:27.803 --> 04:46:31.274

04:46:43.486 --> 04:46:45.488
RICHMOND, SOUTHEAST LA AND

04:46:45.555 --> 04:46:46.756
WILMINGTON. TWO OF THOSE,

04:46:46.822 --> 04:46:48.758
RICHMOND AND WILMINGTON, ARE

04:46:48.824 --> 04:46:50.126
REFINERY COMMUNITIES, AND THE

04:46:50.192 --> 04:46:52.395
OTHER ONES ARE HEAVILY IMPACTED.

04:46:52.461 --> 04:46:54.764

04:47:27.663 --> 04:47:29.498
INCREASING GAS PRICES. THEY

04:47:29.565 --> 04:47:32.134
WILL ALSO BEAR THE BRUNT OF

04:47:32.201 --> 04:47:35.805
CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLLUTION.

04:47:35.871 --> 04:47:38.374

ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT

04:48:14.043 --> 04:48:16.679

04:48:16.746 --> 04:48:18.714
FOR CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION

04:48:18.781 --> 04:48:20.783
FUTURE. CLEAN TRANSPORTATION

04:48:20.850 --> 04:48:22.718
FUTURE SPECIFICALLY. SO THE

04:48:22.785 --> 04:48:23.986
LCFS HAS ENABLED MAJOR

04:48:24.053 --> 04:48:25.588
INVESTMENT IN EV CHARGING

04:48:25.655 --> 04:48:26.889

04:48:28.691 --> 04:48:31.394
AND CREATING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS.

04:48:31.460 --> 04:48:32.528
MAINTAINING THIS PROGRAM IS

04:48:32.595 --> 04:48:34.096
ESSENTIAL TO MEETING THE

04:48:34.163 --> 04:48:35.164
STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND

04:48:35.231 --> 04:48:36.332
ENSURING CALIFORNIA REMAINS A

04:48:36.399 --> 04:48:38.934
LEADER IN THE ZERO EMISSION

04:48:39.001 --> 04:48:41.303

04:48:41.370 --> 04:48:44.573
YOU, THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR.

04:48:44.640 --> 04:48:45.875
MEMBERS JOHN WINGER, HERE ON

04:48:45.941 --> 04:48:47.777
BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL OILSEED

04:48:47.843 --> 04:48:49.645
PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION, I WOULD

04:48:49.712 --> 04:48:50.479
ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE

04:48:50.546 --> 04:48:51.714
AMERICAN SOYBEAN ASSOCIATION

04:48:51.781 --> 04:48:52.782
ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF RENEWABLE

04:48:52.848 --> 04:48:54.884
DIESEL AS COMPARED TO FOSSIL

04:48:54.950 --> 04:48:57.553
DIESEL. WHAT MR. ROM WASN'T

04:48:57.620 --> 04:48:58.954
ABLE TO SAY, BECAUSE WE RAN OUT

04:48:59.021 --> 04:49:00.690
OF TIME WAS THAT WE DO SUPPORT

04:49:00.756 --> 04:49:02.692
THE LCFS, BUT WE DO HAVE SOME

04:49:02.758 --> 04:49:04.560
CONCERNS WITH THE 20% BIODIESEL

04:49:04.627 --> 04:49:05.728
CAP THAT WAS PUT INTO PLACE

04:49:05.795 --> 04:49:08.030
THAT WILL GO INTO EFFECT IN

04:49:08.097 --> 04:49:09.598
2028. THAT'S ON NORTH AMERICAN

04:49:09.665 --> 04:49:11.634
CROPS. SO WE ARE WORRIED THAT

04:49:11.701 --> 04:49:13.436
THAT'S GOING TO INCENTIVIZE

04:49:13.502 --> 04:49:15.805
FOREIGN CROP FEEDS, WHICH WE

04:49:15.871 --> 04:49:17.373
HEARD ABOUT THE DEFORESTATION

04:49:17.440 --> 04:49:19.642
CONCERNS THERE. CARB IS WORKING

04:49:19.709 --> 04:49:20.843
ON AN INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGE

04:49:20.910 --> 04:49:22.712
MODELING UPDATE, WHICH WE THINK

04:49:22.778 --> 04:49:24.747
WILL SHOW THAT WE ARE MORE

04:49:24.814 --> 04:49:26.248
SUSTAINABLE. AND SO WE ARE

04:49:26.315 --> 04:49:27.583
HOPING THAT THAT WILL SHOW THAT

04:49:27.650 --> 04:49:29.185
CARB SHOULD RECONSIDER THAT 20%

04:49:29.251 --> 04:49:30.619
CAP. IT WAS ALSO DISCUSSED AT

04:49:30.686 --> 04:49:32.655
THE FEDERAL LEVEL, THAT THERE'S

04:49:32.722 --> 04:49:33.956
THE RENEWABLE VOLUME OBLIGATION

04:49:34.023 --> 04:49:35.624
AND HOW THAT'S GONE UP. AND SO

04:49:35.691 --> 04:49:37.727
WITH THAT GOING UP AND WITH THE

04:49:37.793 --> 04:49:39.729
CAP GOING INTO PLACE, WE THINK

04:49:39.795 --> 04:49:40.429
THAT'S GOING TO INCENTIVIZE

04:49:40.496 --> 04:49:42.264
RENEWABLE DIESEL TO GO TO OTHER

04:49:42.331 --> 04:49:42.898
STATES RATHER THAN CALIFORNIA,

04:49:42.965 --> 04:49:43.966
WHICH IS GOING TO INCREASE

04:49:44.033 --> 04:49:45.568
FOSSIL DIESEL USE AND OBVIOUSLY

04:49:45.634 --> 04:49:47.636
HAVE WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES.

04:49:47.703 --> 04:49:49.538
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM

04:49:49.605 --> 04:49:51.607

BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

04:49:53.409 --> 04:49:54.510
ARE THE TRANSPORTERS AND

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL. IN

04:49:57.646 --> 04:49:58.848
ADDITION TO CLEAN FUELS,

04:50:01.517 --> 04:50:02.518
ECHO THE COMMENTS BY THE

04:50:02.585 --> 04:50:03.753
PREVIOUS SPEAKER. WE DO SUPPORT

04:50:03.819 --> 04:50:06.322
THE LCFS PROGRAM, BUT DO HAVE

04:50:06.388 --> 04:50:06.922
CONCERNS WITH THE 20% CAP IN

04:50:06.989 --> 04:50:08.958
2028. SO AS CALIFORNIA LEADS

04:50:09.024 --> 04:50:11.127
THE NATION IN TERMS OF THE LCS

04:50:11.193 --> 04:50:11.727
PROGRAMS OTHERS ARE ADOPTING,

04:50:11.794 --> 04:50:13.662
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

04:50:13.729 --> 04:50:14.864
SIGNAL TO THE COUNTRY THAT, YOU

04:50:14.930 --> 04:50:16.632
KNOW, WE'RE STILL AN OPEN

04:50:16.699 --> 04:50:18.667

CUSTOMERS TO MORE READILY ADOPT

04:56:28.036 --> 04:56:29.471
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES PRIOR TO

04:56:29.538 --> 04:56:31.573
THE DRASTIC DROP IN THE CREDITS.

04:56:31.640 --> 04:56:33.075
AS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER, THE

04:56:33.142 --> 04:56:33.542
HYDROGEN DISPENSED IN

ADD SOMETHING A LITTLE NEW TO

04:57:08.744 --> 04:57:10.445
THE PROCEEDINGS. WE KNOW THAT

04:57:10.512 --> 04:57:11.980
WE HAVE PROGRAMS, OBVIOUSLY, IN

04:57:12.047 --> 04:57:12.881
THE THREE PACIFIC STATES. LAST

04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:14.683
YEAR, WE HAD A PROGRAM ADOPTED

04:57:14.750 --> 04:57:17.052
BY THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO. WE

04:57:17.119 --> 04:57:19.254
HAVE COALITIONS THAT WORK IN

04:57:19.321 --> 04:57:20.489
THE UPPER MIDWESTERN STATES

04:57:20.556 --> 04:57:23.725
LOOKING TO ADOPT PROGRAMS.

04:57:23.792 --> 04:57:24.693
MASSACHUSETTS. WE HAD A BILL

04:57:24.760 --> 04:57:27.129
LAST YEAR. WE MAY GET A BILL

04:57:27.196 --> 04:57:28.430
THIS YEAR AGAIN. NEW YORK AND

04:57:28.497 --> 04:57:30.098
NEW JERSEY CONTINUE TO WORK

04:57:30.165 --> 04:57:31.733
WITH COALITIONS. AND IT LOOKS

04:57:31.800 --> 04:57:33.468
LIKE WE'RE GOING TO GET A BILL

04:57:33.535 --> 04:57:34.703
IN PENNSYLVANIA THIS YEAR. AND

04:57:34.770 --> 04:57:38.006
I AND I NOTE THAT JUST TO SAY

04:57:38.073 --> 04:57:40.475
THAT LCFS PROGRAMS ARE NOT JUST

04:57:40.542 --> 04:57:42.477
SOME SORT OF BLUE STATE

04:57:42.544 --> 04:57:44.346
FASCINATION WHEN YOU HAVE

04:57:44.413 --> 04:57:46.515
STATES LIKE NEW MEXICO AND

04:57:46.582 --> 04:57:48.750
PENNSYLVANIA, GAS AND OIL

04:57:48.817 --> 04:57:50.786
STATES, PURPLE STATES,

04:57:50.852 --> 04:57:53.989
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT ONLY BLUE

04:57:54.056 --> 04:57:54.623
STATES THAT CAN SEE THE FUTURE.

04:57:54.690 --> 04:57:56.792
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU

04:57:56.858 --> 04:57:58.860
SO MUCH FOR EVERYONE WHO GAVE

04:57:58.927 --> 04:58:00.596
PUBLIC COMMENTS AND WHO

04:58:00.662 --> 04:58:02.798
PARTICIPATED AS A PANELIST IN

04:58:02.864 --> 04:58:03.632
TODAY'S CONVERSATION, AND ALL

04:58:03.699 --> 04:58:05.500
THOSE WHO ARE STILL HERE TO

04:58:05.567 --> 04:58:07.035
HEAR THE CHAIR'S CLOSING

04:58:07.102 --> 04:58:09.238
REMARKS. I APPRECIATE ALL OF

04:58:09.304 --> 04:58:11.139
YOU. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:58:11.206 --> 04:58:13.375
BE A SELECTED CHAIR OF

04:58:13.442 --> 04:58:15.744
TRANSPORTATION A QUITE A, I

04:58:15.811 --> 04:58:18.313
GUESS, OVER A YEAR AGO NOW. AND

04:58:18.380 --> 04:58:20.983
THAT'S WHERE I FIRST BEGAN TO

04:58:21.049 --> 04:58:22.417
LEARN QUITE A BIT ABOUT LCFS

04:58:22.484 --> 04:58:24.553
AND LEARNED THE BENEFITS OF IT.

04:58:24.620 --> 04:58:25.787
PEOPLE WANTED TO EXPOSE IT TO

04:58:25.854 --> 04:58:27.623
ME AS A NEW CHAIR. AND THEN WE

04:58:27.689 --> 04:58:29.625
STARTED THIS CONVERSATION,

04:58:29.691 --> 04:58:30.659
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RULEMAKING

04:58:30.726 --> 04:58:32.494
WAS COMING TO A CLOSE AND IT

04:58:32.561 --> 04:58:34.763
WAS WEAPONIZED QUITE A BIT LAST

04:58:34.830 --> 04:58:36.765
FALL AROUND IT. AND, AND THERE

04:58:36.832 --> 04:58:40.302
WAS A LOT OF FOCUS AROUND THE

04:58:40.369 --> 04:58:41.870
COST AND THE COST TO CONSUMERS.

04:58:41.937 --> 04:58:44.206
AND SO THEN THAT IGNITED THIS

04:58:44.273 --> 04:58:45.507
CONVERSATION OF AFFORDABILITY.

04:58:45.574 --> 04:58:48.377
AND AS WE OPENED THIS SELECT

04:58:48.443 --> 04:58:49.578
COMMITTEE, THE OPEN THE

04:58:49.645 --> 04:58:50.712
DISCUSSION THAT THIS WOULD BE

04:58:50.779 --> 04:58:52.881
COMING, I GOT TO HEAR FROM EVEN

04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:54.716
MORE PEOPLE AND AND LISTENING

04:58:54.783 --> 04:58:57.052
TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY, I

04:58:57.119 --> 04:58:58.420
WILL TELL YOU THAT NOT ONLY IN

04:58:58.487 --> 04:59:00.289
THE CONVERSATION TODAY, BUT

04:59:00.355 --> 04:59:00.856
EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT HAS

04:59:00.922 --> 04:59:02.991
COME TO MY OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT

04:59:03.058 --> 04:59:04.893
THIS PROGRAM LAUDED THE

04:59:04.960 --> 04:59:06.728
BENEFITS OF LCFS TALKED ABOUT

04:59:06.795 --> 04:59:07.596
WAYS THEY WANT TO TWEAK IT, BUT

04:59:07.663 --> 04:59:09.631
THERE WAS NOT ONE PERSON WHO

04:59:09.698 --> 04:59:11.800
CAME TO MY OFFICE WHO SAID LCFS

04:59:11.867 --> 04:59:14.603
SHOULD NOT EXIST. AND THAT WAS

04:59:14.670 --> 04:59:15.804
REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE AS A

04:59:15.871 --> 04:59:17.472
LEGISLATOR, WHEN PEOPLE COME TO

04:59:17.539 --> 04:59:18.707
MY OFFICE, THERE'S ALWAYS

04:59:18.774 --> 04:59:20.709
SOMEONE TO SAY IT SHOULD BE

04:59:20.776 --> 04:59:21.610
ABOLISHED. BUT THERE WAS NOT

04:59:21.677 --> 04:59:23.812
ONE WHO CAME AND HAD PLENTY OF

04:59:23.879 --> 04:59:25.414
OPPORTUNITY. THE DISCUSSION HAS

04:59:25.480 --> 04:59:27.616
BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME, SO

04:59:27.683 --> 04:59:29.117
THAT HEARTENS ME. SO I'M

04:59:29.184 --> 04:59:30.319
EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY

04:59:30.385 --> 04:59:31.720
OF THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT IT'S

04:59:31.787 --> 04:59:33.722
DOING. AND I THINK SOMEONE SAID,

04:59:33.789 --> 04:59:34.556
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A TECH

04:59:34.623 --> 04:59:35.824
NEUTRAL, MARKET BASED PROGRAM

04:59:35.891 --> 04:59:37.659
THAT IS WORKING EFFECTIVELY FOR

04:59:37.726 --> 04:59:38.927
CALIFORNIA AND HELPING TO

04:59:38.994 --> 04:59:40.595
ENSURE THAT EMISSIONS GLOBALLY

04:59:40.662 --> 04:59:42.831
ARE BEING REDUCED. CAN THERE BE

04:59:42.898 --> 04:59:44.900
TWEAKS ALONG THE WAY? WE'VE

04:59:44.966 --> 04:59:45.801
HEARD FROM WITNESSES,

04:59:45.867 --> 04:59:46.735
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE

04:59:46.802 --> 04:59:49.538
ACADEMIC ARENA. YES, AND THERE

04:59:49.604 --> 04:59:51.206
SHOULD BE BECAUSE IT IS DYNAMIC

04:59:51.273 --> 04:59:52.507
IN ESSENCE. AND SO THERE SHOULD

04:59:52.574 --> 04:59:53.675
BE INTERVENTIONS EVERY ONCE IN

04:59:53.742 --> 04:59:56.078
A WHILE TO MAKE SURE THE

04:59:56.144 --> 04:59:56.611
PROGRAM IS DELIVERING THE

04:59:56.678 --> 04:59:58.914
BENEFITS THAT IT SHOULD BE

04:59:58.980 --> 05:00:00.682
DELIVERING. AS TECHNOLOGY

05:00:00.749 --> 05:00:02.484
CHANGES, AS OUR COMMUNITY'S

05:00:02.551 --> 05:00:04.086
NEEDS CHANGES, AS JUST THE

05:00:04.152 --> 05:00:06.388
WORLD CHANGES. AND SO I AM

05:00:06.455 --> 05:00:08.924
EXCITED THAT WE HAD THIS

05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.758
HEARING TODAY. I'M EXCITED

05:00:09.825 --> 05:00:11.626
ABOUT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT

05:00:11.693 --> 05:00:13.228
WAS BROUGHT FORTH THAT MY

05:00:13.295 --> 05:00:15.430
COLLEAGUES, MY LEGISLATOR, MY

05:00:15.497 --> 05:00:16.565
LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES CAN

05:00:16.631 --> 05:00:19.201
GLEAN FROM TO BE ABLE TO GUIDE

05:00:19.267 --> 05:00:20.869
FUTURE OVERSIGHT

05:00:20.936 --> 05:00:23.004
RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT I DO

05:00:23.071 --> 05:00:23.638
THINK IT'S BEEN MADE ABUNDANTLY

05:00:23.705 --> 05:00:26.575
CLEAR THAT IT IS A VERY COMPLEX

05:00:26.641 --> 05:00:27.776
BENEFICIAL. AND I'LL USE ONE

05:00:27.843 --> 05:00:28.643
WORD, SOMEONE SAID

05:00:28.710 --> 05:00:30.512
UNDERSTANDABLE PROGRAM. BUT A

05:00:30.579 --> 05:00:31.947
LOT OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS

05:00:32.013 --> 05:00:33.415
PROGRAM SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH

05:00:33.482 --> 05:00:34.583
THE RULEMAKING PROCESS, WHERE

05:00:34.649 --> 05:00:37.519
THE DATA IS, AND THAT WE, AS

05:00:37.586 --> 05:00:40.188
THE LEGISLATURE HAVE AN

05:00:40.255 --> 05:00:40.989
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY. AND

05:00:41.056 --> 05:00:42.457
THAT OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY

05:00:42.524 --> 05:00:44.025
INCLUDES THAT WE'RE DELIVERING

05:00:44.092 --> 05:00:45.994
REAL RESULTS FOR CALIFORNIANS

05:00:46.061 --> 05:00:47.829
ON EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM,

05:00:47.896 --> 05:00:50.065
INCLUDING LCFS. AND IT ALSO

05:00:50.132 --> 05:00:51.466
MEANS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

05:00:51.533 --> 05:00:52.634
PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S

05:00:52.701 --> 05:00:55.203
HAPPENING AT CARB TO ENSURE

05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.971
THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE GETTING

05:00:56.037 --> 05:00:59.007
THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THEIR BUCK,

05:00:59.074 --> 05:01:00.175
THAT THEY'RE GETTING AIR

05:01:00.242 --> 05:01:00.742
QUALITY BENEFITS AND THEY'RE

05:01:00.809 --> 05:01:02.677
GETTING ECONOMIC BENEFITS. AND

05:01:02.744 --> 05:01:04.212
WHETHER THAT COMES FROM

05:01:04.279 --> 05:01:05.480
INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY IN

05:01:05.547 --> 05:01:07.649
CALIFORNIA OR THE SAVINGS WE

05:01:07.716 --> 05:01:09.451
GET BECAUSE OF THE IMPACTS THAT

05:01:09.518 --> 05:01:12.254
IT WILL HAVE ON OUR CLIMATE AND

05:01:12.320 --> 05:01:12.854
JUST OUR OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL

05:01:12.921 --> 05:01:14.556
IMPACTS, OUR AIR QUALITY. AND

05:01:14.623 --> 05:01:16.725
SO I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE HAD

05:01:16.792 --> 05:01:20.028
THIS TODAY. IT IS NOW 532 AND

05:01:20.095 --> 05:01:25.600
THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED.

05:01:25.667 --> 05:01:41.783
WELCOME.
